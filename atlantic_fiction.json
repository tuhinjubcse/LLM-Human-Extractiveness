        "story": "It was March when I received the news that Harold had died in one of his caves. I hadn’t expected him to still be doing fieldwork himself; having watched him make a nest of his laurels, I admit that I saw him as one of those shrewd birds that thieves other’s eggs. The last time we’d met was three years before, in Paris. He’d come from a conference in Lyon and was driving a rented Mini that made a caricature of the stately form he’d acquired in his late years—at any moment, the toy car looked like it would break into pieces, the doors falling off and the bottom dropping out, leaving Harold clutching the steering wheel in open air. He was wearing a woolen overcoat and a fur hat in the Russian style; I believe they call it a shapka. He claimed it had been a gift, but it was so apt that it was hard not to believe he had gone out and bought it for himself. I could imagine him walking down the street somewhere and catching sight of it in a shop window, and the uncanny feeling it must have produced in him, like seeing one’s hands on another person. Obviously he had to buy it. When I saw him in that hat, I had a feeling of déjà vu. For a minute, I couldn’t grasp what he reminded me of, until suddenly it hit me that he looked like a Holbein portrait. I saw that glossy animal skin atop his head and the spreading shoulders below, and in a flash something was revealed to me—or so I told myself—about his authorship. One always has the sense of how gloomy it is to be a Holbein, despite their regal bearing. How utterly unfortunate to live so far north, to be constantly suffering drafts, to be given such jowls, to have to go along with the Reformation. They make no bones about their misery, the Holbein people. They’re dressed in those hugely impressive clothes, and yet under the radar of the great master, they somehow manage to smuggle a secret message to us about what a difficult fate it is to be one of them. There was something of that in Harold, I thought: Here was the great ambassadorial gravity of his presence, buttressed on all sides by the bulk of his convictions, and it was all so uniform, so convincing, until, looking closely, you happened to catch a tiny flicker in his small, gray eyes, a little sign of doubt that threatened to throw the entire enormous project of being Harold into question. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. It was that flicker I thought of when I got the call from his sister. While studying his beloved cave art, he had broken the safety rules, left his colleagues behind, and lost his bearings; by the time they found him in a shaft, he was dead from carbon-dioxide poisoning. He must have been wearing his spelunking overalls and hard hat, but as Clara spoke, I pictured him slumped beneath the sword of a stalactite, shapka still perched like a spirit animal atop his head. I was not lying when I told Clara, who was weeping on the other end in her Jerusalem apartment, that I loved Harold. Of course I did. Loved him and resented him too, though I left it at love and didn’t elaborate. Nor did I tell her what I believed to be true: that Harold wasn’t capable of becoming accidentally lost, and that if he had died of lostness, it was because he had decided, in no uncertain terms, to lose himself. After I hung up, I stood, shocked, at the window, staring out through the dusk thickening over Central Park, and when a hunched, darkened form broke rank with the surrounding branches and glided forth—a giant bird with outstretched wings—I saw it as a farewell message from Harold, proof of a levity that had come to him now: a final mark of distinction in the heavens, or whatever realm he had advanced into. Harold, née Harel, Hebrew for “mountain of God”: to the land where he was born, he now was returned, to be buried next to his parents, who had clawed their way to Israel from the threshold of the crematoria, and in defiance conceived the great geologic form of a child, permanent and holy. From the beginning, he could do no wrong. When, at 7, he threw a stone at another child’s head, causing a bloody gash, his mother defended him on the grounds that the injured child had possessed the stupidity to stick his head in the stone’s path. I first heard this canonical story at the start of the summer of our junior year, when I followed Harold back to Jerusalem and stayed with his family. My own mother had always kept a careful log of my shortcomings, written, as my analyst once said, in her own blood. I was used to an anxious love, the kind that cuts down the tree before it can grow so that it can’t be felled by another axe. But Harold was allowed to grow and grow until he became too large for his family’s apartment, too large for Jerusalem, too large even for Israel, and left for America, where, at Yale University, he continued to unfurl. As his roommate, I was amazed to discover that he didn’t know how to fry an egg or do his laundry. Only when I met his family did I come to understand that Harold was their sun king; that they revolved around him, their great hope and vindication. They came to pick us up at the airport, and his mother, in large plastic earrings and practical shoes dusted with ancient sediment, threw herself around his neck, craning her head back to drink him in, until he shook her off to hug his father—a long, tight embrace of a sort that I had never seen between men. “This,” he said, turning back to me at last, “is the friend I’ve been telling you all about.” Seeing me now for the first time, they embraced me too, as if I were an extension of Harold— as if what he loved, they also loved, without reservation. His father had a limp that I imagined had come from the camps, perhaps even Mengele, but he snatched up Harold’s suitcase anyway and carried it to the car. Though their apartment was small, Harold was given the best room and only duvet. I slept on a sort of thin pallet that his mother unrolled every night at the foot of his bed; lying there, I felt resentment at my own mother, who’d made me give up my bed whenever we had a guest. At their dinner table, mother, father, and sister rehearsed for me Harold’s hagiography while he sat silently, endowed with their admiration, drifting in and out of the smoke from his own cigarette. Naturally Harold had impressed me from the start too. In the early months of our courtship, we’d strutted and preened around each other, expounded on Vico’s giants and mimetic desire, formed a cabal consisting of only us and the legendary dead. Though I was better-looking, he was more attractive to women, except when he got carried away and overspilled himself, drowning them in his endless barrage of arguments, assertions, opinions. But until I followed him home, I’d believed our differences to be largely cultural. I’d never been to Israel before, nor had I ever known any Israelis. So I took Harold to represent his kind—took his confidence to be exotic, Middle Eastern, born of a surfeit of sunlight and pioneering; his self-belief to be the survival strategy of a whole people. But when I met his family, I came to understand it as the inevitable result of being loved to the point of worship. My own parents believed that praise was unhealthy, just as they believed that bathing in cold water strengthened resilience. To his parents, Harold was a phoenix risen from the ashes; naturally he had learned to fly. But if I tried to work out how his confidence had been cultivated, bit by bit I also began to believe that it was innate, and however much I coveted it, I would never myself possess it. Harold first took me caving that summer. His father surrendered the car and took two buses to his job at a municipal office so that Harold could drive us to the Dead Sea, where he had been exploring caves since he was a youth in the Scouts. Once we passed out of East Jerusalem, the desert opened up—I’d never seen anything like it; I was moved and terrified by so much space, and what seemed to me the raw matter of the world. Harold bore down on the blue and ancient salt-crusted sea that appeared in the distance. There, he coated himself in foul-smelling clay and floated belly-up like a corpse, drifting out toward the no-man’s-land between the shore and Jordan. Afterward we lunched on the sandwiches his mother had packed for us, and then, thickly swabbing his pita in hummus, he delivered a brilliant lecture about the scrolls discovered in the caves above us, among the oldest known manuscripts of books later included in the Hebrew Bible. There was also the nearby Cave of Horror, where the skeletons of refugees from the Bar Kokhba revolt had been found, having perished under siege by the Romans. As a teenager, Harold himself had found a Roman coin while exploring caves he’d managed to reach on his own. I still remember how his eyes gleamed as he spoke; history had always come alive for him, but his gift was to be able to animate it for those who could not see, as he could, through the narrowest of openings, the sweeping vista of the past. Two decades later, his book The Art of Prehistoric Man was that rare anomaly: praised by his fellow archaeologists and read by laymen. It was to the caves—which we reached that day from the parking lot at the Ein Gedi Field School, after a hike and an arduous climb (back then, Harold had been lithe and, if never slender, at least athletic)—that he was most strongly drawn. In their dank depths his imagination burned most vividly. I think it was a passion connected to his boyhood, to the excitement of uncovering what had lain in secret oblivion for thousands of years. Though I want to say that something more was at work, that what he felt in those underground chambers was something spiritual. Entering behind him that day, nourished by his mother’s lunch, I was set on feeling it too. Heady with Harold’s excitement, with a nearness to the ages such as I had never felt in Grand Rapids or New Haven, I thought that what was his might become mine as well; that I might find it through the ingress of that dark, jagged hole that led far back into time. With jaw clenched, I readied myself, ducking after him into the cave. I don’t know what I thought—that I might receive, be granted, a conversion through atavistic energies, the awakening of an anima that had long been slumbering within. But it was not to be. How could it have been? Years later, when I visited Harold in the Cave of the Trois-Frères, he showed me the stenciled prints of hands that appear in so many painted caves, and spoke of the possibility that those who made them believed in the existence of a world behind the surface of the rock, one that imbued the handprints with its power. Though he couldn’t sustain such belief himself, a sense of sanctity nevertheless came through to him across the passage of time, amplified by the echo of 30,000 or 40,000 years. There was something shamanic about him; he was, I always felt, a kind of conduit. It didn’t surprise me when, at the start of graduate school, he situated himself in the Upper Paleolithic. To me, he had—had always had—special access: Why not to the moment when humanity first discovered its own powers of creativity and chose to represent itself and the world? Was I envious of Harold? Of course I was. At times, I wished I’d never met him and could have gone about things my own way. I thought highly enough of myself when I arrived at college, which was something of a feat, given what I’d been up against at home. But the more I knew of Harold, the more deeply ensconced he became in my psyche, crowding out light and widening a passage for doubt. I fell in love with the first woman who ever wanted me and I clung to her, dedicated myself to her without reserve. Agi used to say that Harold, who began to publish early, confused his pen for his penis. Only much later did I begin to see the holes in his own self-belief. Harold himself was always fascinated by the contradictions in people. In countless conversations, he circled back to that: how a person can contain within himself such violently opposing forces, and they either hold him in strange balance or tear him apart. Only much later did it occur to me that perhaps all that time, however unconsciously, he had been asking me to see what he knew others would miss in him. On the plane to Israel for the funeral, I noted down a few scattered remarks, should Clara ask me to speak. It might have been presumptuous—in later years, Harold and I had been in touch far less—but I remained, after all, one of his oldest friends. And yet what was there to say about Harold’s passion? His appetite? His special knowledge of the Fall of Man? What did a world without Harold mean? I lifted the window shade and stared out into the blinding dark. Had it not been for Harold, I wrote, I might have become what I wanted to be. That might have gotten a laugh, but it was true enough—we had met in a class on the ancient world, and our mutual passion for the subject drew us immediately together. I’d harbored hopes of becoming a historian, though my parents expected me to go into business or law. It was Harold, a man of the sun and the Earth, who loved the materiality of things—Harold who needed to palpate history (and not only history) with his own hands. It was contagious. Why should I want to study history behind a desk, or in the musty basements of libraries, when I could be out in the field, out in the world, excavating what had been lost, forgotten, hidden? Bringing the past, quite literally, to light? That day in the caves above the Dead Sea, he had inhaled the humid earthiness, nostrils flaring, and caressed the walls with a kind of sensuousness. Later I would blame my parents for my retreat into law, where I went from success to success, and rose to become a partner in the firm. But in my heart, I considered Harold responsible. He took up the whole field of history, of prehistory; I couldn’t see how I could pursue it in his wake, I would have forever been aware of all I was lacking. I studied history for as long as I could before I had to make a definitive choice, and then, if only to get out from under his shadow, I slunk away into law. I don’t think I’d ever put it so bluntly to myself, but in the darkened hull of the airplane, trying to make sense of what Harold had been to me, I knew that’s what I believed. I hadn’t been back to Israel since that long-ago summer. I’d never had the desire; I suppose I’d never really liked the place—the overfreighted passion, the endless exaggeration, every day a mountain out of a molehill. From Ben Gurion Airport, I took a taxi straight to the cemetery and arrived there just in time. Squinting in the sunlight, I saw the dark clot of mourners gathered among the cypresses. Two of Harold’s three wives were there, his grown children, a handful of friends and colleagues: whoever could make it so far, in such haste, to see Harold put to rest in his shroud. A larger memorial service was to be held at Oxford at a later date, in the chapel at Magdalen College, where Harold had been a fellow for 30 years, and where, on a long-ago visit, he’d shown me an enormous 16th-century copy, made by da Vinci’s studio, of The Last Supper : the ballet of hands, the feet, the elegant betrayal. I stood across from his third and youngest wife, who’d separated from Harold a few years earlier because she wanted a family; underneath her shapeless linen dress, she appeared to be pregnant. She was an archaeologist too, a woman who normally went around dressed in Patagonia and had little tolerance for formality. But his first wife, Helen—to whom he had been married for more than 20 years, and who had maintained toward Harold an attitude of wry condescension that allowed her to indulge him—had always been glamorous. She stood now, petite and dark, in enormous sunglasses. After the rabbi said some words, their son and daughter spoke, the latter stepping forward to address the hole in the ground, as if the finally mute Harold could hear her. She hadn’t talked to Harold through her teenage years, as far as I recalled, but now she was talking to him. She was followed by one of Harold’s closest friends and colleagues, an Englishman who called him a mensch, which struck me as a goyish misunderstanding of the word, and spoke of the terrible accident. I looked around at people’s faces—did no one else suspect that Harold had been deliberate? That he would never make such a misstep? Next to the hole stood the headstones of his parents. The sudden transformation of life into archaeology—who’d understood that better than Harold? When my turn came to throw a handful of dirt, I crumpled the page of notes I’d written and threw it in with the soil. It was then, while I was looking down into the hole at the bottom of which Harold lay, that the bile rose in the back of my throat and I felt, for the first time, that I might weep. Afterward we gathered at his sister’s apartment, a brightly colored and comfortably inhabited place that exuded a sense of the good and happy life that Clara—uncelebrated and mostly overlooked by her parents—had grown up to lead. Framed photographs of Harold were set out on a table. At the center was a large one, taken 10 or 15 years earlier, of him standing before a cave wall on which painted bison and horses seemed to be flying past in perpetual motion. His head was tilted back, and eyes cast upward, and the effect was of Harold paused at attention, listening to the sound of their hooves. His fellow prehistorians agreed that deciphering the meaning of the paintings would only ever be speculative. But Harold had made his name with the theory that they had been produced at the moment when, after millennia of being dominated by animals, humans began to dominate them. He likened it to the Fall of Man, only the forbidden knowledge acquired was that humans were distinct from other animals. The paintings, he asserted, expressed the guilt, regret, and glory that came with the belief in that separation. Like all theories, right or wrong, it said something—or so I always thought—about its author: his will to triumph, the loneliness of his distinction. Looking up from the photograph, I caught sight of Helen refilling the platters of food. I had the urge to lead her away so that we might speak in confidence: Surely she didn’t believe that Harold had gotten lost, and was merely pretending for the sake of Clara and the kids? For 35 years, she had been seeing through Harold. When she bobbed away after my second or third approach, I got the sense that she was avoiding me. I finally cornered her in the kitchen, and with lowered voice asked her if he’d been depressed. She gave me a long, tired look. “Everyone liked to think they’d figured Harold out,” she said. “Only Harold could admit to never figuring out himself.” Then she squeezed my arm, offered a worn smile, and turned to rejoin the others in the living room. And yet it gnawed at me. I went out to the terrace to smoke. The hills of Jerusalem were turning a fiery gold, but I wasn’t in the mood to appreciate their beauty. For as long as I’d known him, Harold had been gnawing at me! How many things did I hold against him? Why not his death, too? It was 35 years ago that I’d found him in bed with Agi. His hairy back in the moonlight; he was consuming her. She was Hungarian, Agnetta who went by Agi—my Agi! As a child, she used to crawl between the double windows of her Budapest apartment, and there, in that narrow space of insulation, suspended between the inner and outer world, she read. I loved her for that. Her family had escaped in the back of a truck to Naples, and in its warm climate she discovered that there were no double windows, and barely even a windowsill. Instead, she spent her days standing on a chair looking out at the lines of laundry and the blue Mediterranean, and so she emigrated, as she put it, from books to the world. She had a heart-shaped face, dark eyes, an astuteness that was almost witchy; I thought I might marry her, though I was always a little afraid of her, too. Afterward, I didn’t speak to Harold for two years—difficult years, during which I fell into a deep depression, and nearly dropped out of law school. Our friendship should have been over, but he wore me down with letters of apology, claiming to be a sex addict, and when, one day, he showed up in the lobby of my apartment in New York, I let him up. For once he appeared smaller, humbled. The fury had gone out of me after all I’d been through, which of course had stemmed from things that stretched back much further than Agi. Perhaps a part of me was even relieved to lose her, to no longer have to deserve her. And yet, I never really believed his excuses. No matter that I’d already ceded to him the whole field of history—he could be magnanimous at times, and having him in your corner was something, and yet underneath everything he couldn’t help himself, he needed to conquer at any cost. It was part of a proof being worked out, a proof about the nature of Harold. All his life he was engaged in proving something that he didn’t entirely believe about himself. Coming to see this is what allowed me to continue to be his friend. I’m not proud of it, but the truth is that I could tolerate his largeness because I found satisfaction in being able to spy the weakness at his core. After a while, I was called back inside. Stories were being told. His children and Clara sat on collapsible chairs, and we were to entertain them with remembrances of Harold. Helen told the story of the time they all went on safari when the kids were young, and Harold, alone in their hut, sitting on the toilet when a gang of baboons broke in, emerged from the invasion, as he’d put it, spiritually altered. No one knew exactly what had happened, but for the rest of the trip his respect for the baboons was enormous; at every appearance of the tribe, Harold went off with them to huddle, as if he suddenly shared with them a common language. While she spoke, I thought of what to recount. The story of the time we went to London as students, and Harold stayed out one night and came back to our borrowed flat with the princess of Norway? Or how, when my daughter was born, he sent a horrendous, yellowish, sickle-shaped thing in the mail, which we discovered, after my wife threw it out, was the 30,000-year-old tooth of a cave bear, intended to act as an amulet? Or should I instead recall the part of his book—easily overlooked or forgotten—on how the high levels of carbon dioxide that cycle into underground chambers cause hallucinations, a phenomenon that likely played a role in the mythologies and rituals that took place in the painted caves? Or the lab experiments he’d cited, showing that subjects who fall into such an induced trance experience the same three stages: first seeing lines, zigzags, and abstract forms; then seeing objects; and finally feeling pulled into a vortex that induces vivid hallucinations, usually of monsters or animals, with which they feel their body and spirit merge? Didn’t anyone else feel the need to ask what, departing the human, Harold had finally become? In the end, I told the story of the day he took me to the Cave of the Trois-Frères and how, overwhelmed, I turned to Harold, who was looking at the paintings, and, for the first and only time in my life, saw on his face a look of absolute reverence. And yet my agitation only grew. By the time I took a taxi back to my hotel, I felt my insides churning and thought I might be sick. I rolled down the window, and the warm spring evening floated in. But I felt a depressing weight descend, a heavy sense of guilt. In the elevator I grew dizzy. A vision came to me of Harold’s carbide headlamp ablaze in the dark like the eye of Polyphemus. In the room I gulped a bottle of water, closed the curtains, and lay down to wait for sleep. But what followed was a long and difficult night in which I tossed and turned, trying to cough up the bone in my throat. My mind roamed restlessly, driven and disturbed, until at last, down long and darkened passages, a hazy memory returned to me, dragging its heavy burden: Harold sitting in a chair by a hospital bed in which I lay. The memory had been lumped together with all of the strange, drugged visions I’d had that week so long ago, after I’d tried feebly to take my own life. No one except my parents knew where I was, and Harold and I hadn’t spoken for a year by then. He couldn’t have known, and in any case, I would have been humiliated had he known, and so later it was buried in the jumbled set of half-waking dreams, which included one of my mother captaining an ancient ship at sea, and a dark army of hundreds, even thousands, marching forward, come to take me. But lying now in the dark room, I felt that it had happened. It had happened, hadn’t it? Somehow Harold had found out, and come to sit with me, and out of respect for my dignity had never mentioned it afterward. And some part of me had always known, and buried it out of shame. The dark army had knelt before my bed, the troops had waited to take me, and I had almost gone—what a relief it would have been to go!—but in the end I stayed. Something shifted in me, and I turned them away and came back to my life. It was Harold who had come, hadn’t he? I had never had the courage to ask him. Later, I decided that Harold would not have understood those shades of darkness, nor the horror of true despair. Or perhaps I needed for him not to understand. Needed to see him as one chosen by life, gifted with every advantage, so that I had an excuse not to pursue the things I wanted most. His existence let me off the hook. And if, later on, when my life turned out well regardless and I began to see cracks in the picture of Harold, didn’t I see them only because it made me feel better to have chosen as I had? Then it was easy to think how difficult it must have been to be him. Harold had always been what I needed him to be, hadn’t he? He had allowed me to see him as I wanted to see him, as he’d let his parents and so many others. If I had failed to truly understand him, it was because it hadn’t been to my advantage to really try. At one or two in the morning, I finally rose from bed, dressed, and fled the hotel, desperate for some air. I walked the empty streets without direction. A few times one of the Orthodox, dressed in dark clothes, hurried past me, coming and going from who knows where in the middle of the night, away from or toward some urgent learning, or some prayer for the living or dead. I didn’t know where I was going, but I, too, was bent forward like them, pressed with tension. After 20 minutes, I saw a taxi and flagged it down. Harold had once told me that even Neanderthals buried their dead with red flowers. But having no clue how to procure any at that hour, I demanded instead to be taken to the Dead Sea. The driver laughed, which only stoked my irritation and made me dig in my heels. When he saw that I was serious, he flicked four or five beads of a misbaha under his thumb and said the drive would take an hour and a half from Jerusalem; late as it was, he wouldn’t do it for less than 400 shekels. I paid him. Here you’re staying? he asked, gesturing in the direction of the hostel, though he might have meant the desert itself. I nodded. In the dark, I recognized nothing. The place looked abandoned; a lone dog barked in the distance. Forty years had passed since that summer of my visit. The cliffs loomed up terribly out of the blackness. The driver counted the bills while I got out, then gave me a last interrogating look through the half-lowered window; if he had been trained to kill, perhaps he also had been trained to save, though presumably he was less practiced at that. He spun the car back toward the road, headlights momentarily sweeping the vast, striated geology, an expression of all time. The lowest place on Earth! Harold had exclaimed when the fetid, turquoise sea had at last come into view. That day, he’d been fixed on what he’d wanted to show me. The sun beat down savagely, but he mopped the sweat from his face with a crumpled bandanna and otherwise took no notice. I followed as he made his way nimbly, goatlike, over the rocks. He was talking, he was always talking. Words flooded from him as if from a spring fed by an ancient aquifer: a 12,000-year-old grave had been found in a cave in the Galilee, a woman’s body covered with two martens, the foreleg of a wild boar, the wing tip of a golden eagle, the pelvis of a leopard, the shells of some 50 tortoises, a human foot placed lovingly—lovingly?—between the two of her own. God knows what else he said. Lost psalms, the Book of Lamentations. We reached the mouth of the cave and I followed him inside, where it immediately became dim and cool. Onward he went into darkness, removing a headlamp from his pack to light the way. Our footsteps began to echo, and I lost all measure of the space around us, guided only by Harold and the beam of his lamp. I thought of Agi, her beautiful naked back arched over a book as she read, and missed her terribly. I imagined skulls in crevices, brown with age, the jawbones come away. The pottery shards of a last meal. A wave of nausea seized me. Nothing spoke to me; I lacked reception and had no taste for cave life. But Harold forged ahead. A wall loomed up and he studied it for footholds, then instructed me to follow him. The climb was harder than it looked, but at last I scrambled after him to the top, gasping for breath in the thin air. He was standing before a huge stalactite, pointing a flashlight at what seemed to be some sort of primitive writing, black chicken scratch on stone. It had been found by the guide at the Field School who’d first discovered the cave. Written in Hebrew script older than the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was, Harold told me, a sort of curse. I didn’t ask him what kind. I felt sick, filled with a terrible gloom. Deep in his rapture, Harold didn’t notice my mounting anxiety, my breath coming more heavily. There was only air enough for one of us; let Harold decipher the menacing letters. I was desperate to get back out into the sunlight, where, unoppressed, I might go on with life, less and less touched by history. But even then, I couldn’t leave him, couldn’t retreat to choose my own way. Now, turning alone in the dark, I had no clue which way to go. A howl of rage filled the back of my throat. I would never know what he had finally discovered—there on the other side, among the endless buried."

        "story": "Many moons ago, my beloved husband, Miguel Herrera—have you heard of him?—gave an earthshaking performance in an event space in the East Village, Henderson Square (actually our friend Hattie Henderson’s studio apartment), that completely changed our lives. It was on a warm spring evening, impossibly verdant considering the urban grit, or maybe it was just youth (mine) aromatizing the air. But there was an anticipatory excitement I felt a lot back then, in my fingertips and in my belly, as I walked up St. Marks to the theater, my senses heightened. I could smell the dirt at the base of the scraggly sidewalk trees, the animal and human urine perfuming their roots, and the peppery green of their unfurling leaves. Even the weed the punks from Scarsdale were smoking as they camped outside Hattie’s building was nothing like the skunky stuff we have now. It was the scent of “something coming,” like those old Sondheim lyrics from West Side Story, so stimulating that I almost couldn’t bear it. What can I say? I was 22, finally free of my parents, madly in love, and ready to eat the world. Hattie lived on the top floor of a five-story walk-up. I’d gotten off late from work and was rushing, so I took the stairs two steps at a time in my Doc Martens and a chiffon thrift-shop dress so flowy, I carried a cloud of the stoners’ exhales with me as I climbed. When I arrived at the open door, I was breathless and already a little high. The room was full. I could see the stage over the heads of the people sitting on the floor and on folding chairs, and through a crowd of standing-room-onlys. I would end up watching the whole event perched in an open window frame at the back of the room next to the fire escape, half in, half out, but I didn’t care. I could smoke cigarettes there, and I was delighted that Miguel and his crew had such a good audience. In that moment, maybe for the first and last time in my life, I knew I was exactly where I should be: on the top floor of a tenement near Avenue A, in this magical little bird’s nest of creativity, married to a brilliant, handsome man who was crazy about me. I still believe all this to be true. In those days, Hattie slept on an ad hoc Murphy bed, just a metal frame with springs that she’d rigged herself. Whenever she crammed folks into her teeny place, she folded it up against a wall with the help of shower-curtain hooks and rods, concealing the bulge of the mattress with blue-and-white tablecloths she’d found at Azuma, a Japanese schlock shop on Eighth Street next door to Brentano’s, where I was employed as a bookseller. Otherwise, there was just a low rust-colored corduroy sofa that Miguel and I had helped her lug from where he’d spotted it on Avenue B, near the park, plus some overstuffed pillows strewn across the linoleum floor. On non–performance nights, when we brought Stromboli’s pizzas upstairs in cardboard boxes, we were a family: the three of us with our similar-sounding last names—I’d taken Miguel’s at the City Clerk’s Office in Lower Manhattan, no way was I holding on to Lipschutz—and completely different origin stories. Usually, we were joined by whomever Hattie was dating at the time: boys, girls, it didn’t matter, it was “the person” that counted to Hattie. We’d spread a big beach towel out on her floor like a picnic table, drink Bolla Soave out of Dixie cups, and eat hard, sandy Italian cookies from Veniero’s bakery, my favorites bejeweled by maraschino cherries. On performance nights like this one, she arranged the various forms of seating in a tight semicircle around “the stage,” an empty white box of nothingness otherwise known as Hattie’s kitchen. In a corner of the room was her ancient refrigerator, which tended to buzz at precisely the wrong time, a sink, a little wooden bar cart that housed her coffee maker, a toaster oven, and a hot plate. Sometimes, Hattie invited poets to read. Occasionally, playwrights like me used the room to workshop stuff. Already, as I settled into my window seat, the spritely, generous Hattie was starting the evening as she always did: with a little song she’d written, and which she played on her ukulele. Hattie had no real talent to speak of, beyond the curatorial—which I now know is everything. I didn’t realize what a petri dish “the Square” was until a bunch of us just kept on working after getting our start there, and a few folks became famous. Then she introduced the show. For months, Miguel and his best friend from boyhood, Angel, both Dominicans from Washington Heights, had been working on a same-sex performance of an abridged version of Sam Shepard’s masterful new play, Fool for Love. An actor friend had snuck them a script, and in their buoyant and budding hubris, they’d futzed around with it, with an eye toward giving Angel, openly gay, a role to shine in. The show had by this time premiered in San Francisco, and Shepard had already won a Pulitzer for something else, but that didn’t stop these two from having their fun. Shepard’s play was about a pair of lovers, Eddie and May, who find out well into their romance—which began as teenagers—that they have the same biological father. Hearing this news, Eddie’s mother kills herself, and the kids break up. Years later, Eddie, still heartbroken, tracks May down to a motel room on the edge of the Mojave Desert to win her back. The lights dimmed, and three men entered the stage from the greenroom of Hattie’s loo. My Miguel, in his best James Dean white T-shirt and a borrowed motorcycle jacket, was the tortured Eddie. The Murphy bed was open and neatly made. That and two of the folding chairs were the lone props. Angel, dressed like a carhop on roller skates (a nod to Shepard’s earlier The Tooth of Crime), wore white leather rhinestone shorts and a white mesh top. He was May, although they had changed his name to Max, and he executed a series of graceful figure eights before rolling to the kitchen sink to begin washing dishes. In Shepard’s original script, the father was identified only as “the Old Man,” and this evening, he was played by an older Brit—by which I mean older than us, nearing 30—who was also the director. This guy, a “total fox,” as we used to say, with teal-colored eyes and long, long legs, sat to the side of the stage in one of the folding chairs, wearing worn denim overalls, a plaid flannel shirt, and a fishing hat (as if that touch of Americana might cancel out his accent). As per the text, he commented throughout the play. But it was Miguel who had the kickoff, laying out Eddie and Max’s history: It was like we knew each other from somewhere but we couldn’t place where. But the second we saw each other, that very second, we knew we’d never stop being in love. It’s not like I was an idiot or Miguel was a liar. Au contraire. We told each other everything! We were soulmates. And we were fools. He was talking about Angel’s character but looking directly at me, giving a little wink. I winked back; he did this once a show. Always. It was our “thing,” because the first time we’d laid eyes on each other on the train, back in high school, he’d leaned across the subway car and said, “What fucks like a tiger and winks?” and then blinked both his eyes silly. We’d laughed back then, and even now, six years later, it still undid me. Then Miguel strode onto center stage, just as Angel turned away from the sink to dry his hands on a paper towel. The look on Angel/Max’s face when he saw Miguel/Eddie in his home! Miguel said: He’s just standing there, staring at me and I’m staring back at him and we can’t take our eyes off each other. Then Miguel moved toward poor Angel. I came to see if you were all right, he said. I don’t need you! Angel cried out. Okay, Miguel said. Fine, and he started to walk away. Angel, in agony, screamed: DON’T GO! With that, they rushed into each other’s arms. In victory, Miguel actually appeared to levitate off the ground. And there it was, the anguish and joy that genuine passion created, the to-ing and fro-ing, the losing and winning—at this point in my life, I don’t know if I’d wish it on anyone, but back then, there was no denying the jealousy and exhilaration we in the audience felt while witnessing their A-Train-coming-at-you brand of forbidden love. Who wouldn’t want a piece of that sexy, hot, rapturous action if they could have it, even momentarily, no matter what the cost? They were so goddamned alive in each other’s arms! That’s what I adore about the theater. It tells a truth that can’t be conveyed in an article or an essay or even a Dear John letter. It’s not like I was an idiot or Miguel was a liar. Au contraire. We told each other everything! We were soulmates. And we were fools. But what I saw on that stage in Hattie’s apartment was two boys desperately in love, so ready to fuck there and then, I could literally picture it in my mind’s eye. I was crying when Hattie hit the light switch at the close of the show (the Square had no curtains), and clapping thundered throughout the apartment, the iridescent bubble that I’d blown around my life punctured and now impossible to reconstruct. Before it was revealed to me through live theater, our marriage arrangement had somehow felt negligible, even deniable, something theoretical and insubstantial that I could brush aside. Never in my whole life have I ever understood anything that was not presented to me on a silver platter of narrative. You could put a message on a billboard on Broadway, up in lights, but it wouldn’t sink in unless I arrived at it through the transformative journey of a well-enacted story. I was crying, but also I felt nauseated. I thought, I must be getting my period—maybe I’m just feeling hormonal? Disavowal and acceptance were paradoxically my drugs of choice—until they weren’t. When Hattie turned the lights back up again, I made a beeline for the restroom as all three performers, now receiving a standing O, were taking their well-earned bows. I had to push through the crowd and cut across a corner of the stage to get there. Hattie’s bathroom. It was the same water closet that the actors had stepped away from or, in Angel’s case, rolled out of just 90 minutes earlier. I opened the door, turned on the light, and closed it behind me. Hattie’s toothbrush and toothpaste sat in a little plastic cup on the dated olive-green enamel sink. I swiped a tampon from the box I knew she kept in the medicine chest. After I inserted it, flushed the paper applicator, and began to wash my hands and tearstained face, I looked hard at myself in that oxidizing mirror: I was pretty in a way most girls are for a time when they are young. I had a mild eating disorder, which was looking good on me. Ellen Stewart at La MaMa had agreed just the week before to produce my newest one-act. What was I whining about? My husband and I were made for each other. We snuck into Broadway plays during intermission and, back in the day, had danced together at Hurrah, listened to music at Max’s Kansas City, played pool in the neighborhood bars, stayed up all night talking about the sun, moon, and stars. Most important, he read every single page I ever wrote and improved them almost all of the time. I’d never felt that understood or supported by anyone else in my entire life. So what, he liked to sleep with men? I did too. This had all been discussed and understood between us since the 12th grade. I, also, could have sex with whomever I chose, although he didn’t like it when I did, and I didn’t want to—and anyway, Miguel and I were still lovers, he was enough for me, he knew how to get me off, and he did it willingly and, I’d thought at the time, with some pleasure (although he preferred me on my stomach). He just did other things with other people once in a while because I wasn’t enough for him. No one’s fault but God’s, whom Miguel believed in; he was Catholic, and that is why we married. (I was a secular Jew from Stuyvesant Town whose parents thought I’d lost my mind. They were still hoping I’d get back together with my sixth-grade boyfriend, David Hershleder, who’d gone from Bronx Science straight to Cornell University and was headed in the fall to Mount Sinai medical school. Hershleder was the ideal son-in-law!) Looking in the mirror, I’d almost convinced myself that all this was true—easy, because it was—and that it was also sustainable (I can feel you rolling your eyes), and, while I was practicing the art of self-deception, that I, too, like Sam Shepard, would win a Pulitzer if I finally wrote a play with three full acts, when the British director barged into the bathroom without knocking. “Sorry, but I really need to wee,” he said. “Don’t let me stop you,” I said. He reached into the fly of his overalls, whipped it out, and aimed straight into the toilet. “I was practically swimming out there.” He’d played the nasty Old Man kind of stiffly, I thought, but then again, he wasn’t supposed to be an actor. He was the director, the director who’d coaxed that magnificent performance out of my Miguel. In 30 more awkward seconds, I learned that his name was Walker, and after he buttoned up and politely washed his hands, he shook mine and introduced himself. “Anna,” I said. Then I turned the bathroom knob, and we exited together. Miguel and Angel were grinning maniacs standing in the middle of the set with their arms around each other’s shoulders, like ballplayers after a winning game surrounded by a circle of glowing fans. Miguel was on his tippy-toes, telescoping his neck (shortness being his single physical imperfection), clearly searching the room. “Anna,” he shouted, waving me over and giving Walker the stink eye. “Where have you been? What were you two doing in there? Not coke, I hope, without me.” What choice did I have then but to run to him? It was my job as his wife, his muse! He let go of Angel and swung me around in the air in a little circle, the skirt of my dress billowing, like everything about us, dramatically. “What did you think, mi amor?” he asked. “You were so amazing!” I said. “You liked it?” he whispered in my hair. “It was all for you. For us.” And then he smiled. “And a little bit for Angel.” “I did, I did,” I said, while he pulled back and held me at arm’s length to see if I was telling the truth. My opinion was of the utmost importance to him. “You were great. He was good. But you were truly spectacular.” “I love you so much,” he said. “Every day I ask God, ‘How did I get this lucky?’” “I love you too,” I said. Then he put one crazy macho arm possessively around my shoulders. I could smell his underarm when he reached over behind my head, his Old Spice, and the musk of him, like when he ran, or when we had sex; he was painted in sweat from the performance. “I see you’ve met my wife,” he said to Walker. “Anna?” said Walker, his eyebrows shooting up in cartoonish surprise. Just then, Hattie’s refrigerator loudly buzzed like a timer on a game show. Everyone turned to look at it, and then everyone turned back to look at Walker. “Well, I guess I have met your wife,” Walker said, regaining his footing. “What were the two of you doing together in the bathroom?” Miguel asked again. Suddenly, we were back at the basketball courts in Fort Tryon Park, surrounded by the Bichos, his tough-guy crew from high school. It was another thing I loved about him—how easily he got territorial and possessive. “I really had to go,” said Walker, shrugging. “I didn’t realize someone was already in there.” “We met-cute,” I said, hoping to sound flip. There was a fizzy little blonde in a polka-dot mini and one of those fuzzy sweaters standing impatiently next to Angel. “Anna, this is Jeannie Elbazz,” Miguel introduced us. “She’s an agent. She reps Jake Kaminsky.” I knew the name. Jeannie’s. Jake’s too. He’d been in all those Oliver Stone movies. Clearly, so did Walker. He stuck out his hand. “Walker Cogdill,” he said. “Nice job directing,” said Jeannie, meaningfully. I guessed she didn’t think much of his acting ability either. Then she turned to me. “Do you mind if I borrow your hubby for the rest of the evening? I’ve been invited to a little industry party, and there are some people I’d like for him to meet.” Walker and Angel released a collective sigh of defeat. “No, I don’t mind,” I said, in wifely mode. “Walker and Angel and I were planning on getting dinner anyway.” Why on earth did I say that? That’s the last thing I wanted. I wanted to go home. Kiss my Siamese cat, Buster. Put on Joni Mitchell. Cry my eyes out in the shower. Smoke a joint and call Hattie and talk to her until either Miguel arrived or we both fell asleep on the phone. “Lo siento, querida,” Angel said to me. “I’m going dancing with the fairies.” He pointed to his posse waiting patiently in the corner. One of them was his official boyfriend, Bobby. He was the first to get sick, although he lived long enough to go on AZT. “I’d be happy to dine with you,” said Walker. Jeannie was already glancing with impatience at her watch. Miguel looked at me searchingly with his big, dark eyes. He was sweet that way. He wanted to make sure I was okay. The cynical among you may accuse me of looking back through the rosy gold of a nostalgic haze, but I’m not sure anyone else, be they parent or lover or friend, has ever been as attentive to my feelings as he was. “Go,” I said. “Go.” We kissed goodbye, and I gave Jeannie a little wave, but she was already heading out the door, and Miguel was loping across the floor to catch up with her. Then I turned to Walker. “You really don’t have to,” I said. “This is my very first American gig,” said Walker. “It’s either I eat with you, or I get a couple of slices by my lonesome and go home and watch the telly.” “Do you like Szechuan cold sesame noodles?” I asked him. They were the rage in those days, and super cheap. “That’s Chinese, hmm? New to me,” said Walker. “But new to me is why I’m here. I’m game. Also, I’m pretty fucking hungry.” “Bamboo House,” I said. “The sign says Chinese food, but it’s really just sesame oil and peanut butter. However, they serve free wine. Just over on Second Avenue.” “Free wine, you say?” said Walker. “I’m sold. You lead the way.” “Okay,” I said. “But first I have to go thank Hattie.” It took me another 30 minutes or so to extricate myself from the Square, there were so many cheeks to kiss, compliments to collect, and joints to toke. As I finally made it to the door, that guardian angel Hattie offered, sotto voce, “If you want to come back after, Annie, we can have a sleepover,” and I nodded, feeling a little teary again. So I was surprised to find Walker waiting patiently for me on the sidewalk when I finally made my exit. I was sure he would be long gone, but there he was, drinking a beer. When I hopped off the last stoop step onto the street, he produced another bottle for me from the cargo pocket of his overalls. “I know these dungarees seem a bit sad,” he said, staring down at his pathetic outfit. “But they are in the stage directions. I got you a Heineken. Sorry if it’s warm as piss.” “It took me too long to get out of there,” I said. “My fault. Are you still up for this?” “Stop asking that,” said Walker. “It’s embarrassing. I have nothing else to do, and I’m grateful for the company.” We started walking over to Second Avenue, past what looked like a little Catholic school on the left, and Café Mogador, where they still have belly dancing, I’m told, on the right. The sidewalk was crowded, because the night was just getting started. “So how long have you and Miguel been hitched?” He grabbed my waist as I was about to step in a little Carvel curl of dog doo, and swung me past it, just by lifting me off the ground an inch or two. The man was taller and stronger than I’d thought at first blush. “Three years,” I said. “But we’ve been together six. We did it after my freshman year at the New School.” “Good for you. Though you don’t look old enough to be married to anyone,” said Walker. “Well, I am,” I said, defiantly. I swelled with pride out of habit. We turned the corner; Bamboo House was in the middle of the block. “That’s it,” I said, pointing to the neon sign in the plate-glass window. “‘Exotic food,’” Walker read out loud. “I guess the free wine isn’t enough of a selling point?” He opened the door and walked right in. Well trained by his loving mama, Miguel always held the door for me. To his credit, Walker sidestepped and held it ajar with one foot. We were seated in a vinyl booth by the window, bordered by snake plants on the sill, red lanterns hanging above our heads. A busy Chinese man wearing a white paper hat placed a teapot and two cups on the Formica table. Chopsticks and forks. Then he handed us menus that had been tucked under one arm. Walker opened his. “What should I have?” he asked. “Egg rolls, barbecued ribs, fried rice?” Those were Miguel’s favorites. “Done,” said Walker, and closed it again. “What? I was just listing some family favorites. I’m not so sure how balanced a meal that is.” “Well, I’m famished. And we’re also getting the peanut macaroni, right?” he said. “Then I think this should be enough.” I looked at the menu and remembered my eating disorder. “I’m getting some brown rice and steamed broccoli,” I said. “And I’ll let you eat my noodles,” he said, like it was settled. I relaxed a little. The waiter came back with two cold glasses of fetchingly toxic-looking wine—they were an unnatural shade of Crayola lemon yellow—and placed them on the table. He took out his guest-check pad, and Walker nodded at me, so I did the ordering for both of us. “What about you?” I asked, once the waiter was out of earshot. “Do you have someone special in your life?” I sounded like my great-aunt Sadie. “Holly? She’s a ballerina,” he said. “She’s dancing with the Royal Ballet right now. She’s supposed to come visit this summer if I last that long.” “Why did you come to New York?” I asked. I took a sip of the wine. It was as sweet and thirst-quenching as Kool-Aid. I liked it. It went down easy, and when the waiter passed by, I motioned for another round, even though I hadn’t finished this one yet. By the time he came back with the food, I’d want it. “I can do things here I can’t do back in London. Like tonight, for instance. Like, I also like to stage dance, which is how Holly and I met. I’m not afraid of mixing stuff up,” he said. “Music, dance, theater, art, it’s all the same to me. Together, it’s only more interesting.” “I write plays myself,” I said. “It’s the only thing I can do, period. I mean, I work in a bookstore, and I’m slowly, slowly creeping toward my B.A., but I’d be a disaster at an office job, or anything else grown-up.” The waiter plopped two new glasses of wine on the table, as if they had been pre-poured on a conveyor belt in the kitchen. Finally, Walker took a tiny sip from his first one. “This stuff is nasty,” he said, making a face. “We could order you a beer?” I said, chugging mine. “Nah.” He smiled. “It’s like this neighborhood. Sweet, cheap, and nasty. I’m thrilled to be here.” And indeed, he looked thrilled. “So what is Holly like?” I asked. “She’s fabulous. Beautiful, talented, smart, kind …” He trailed off a little. “But?” I said. He shook his head and frowned. “I’m not sure I love her enough,” he said. “I don’t have that problem,” I said. “Oh, no?” he asked, arching an eyebrow. “You and Miguel?” “If anything, I love him too much,” I said. “I’m quoting the master himself now,” Walker said. “‘Love is the only disease that makes you feel better.’ Sam Shepard said that in an interview I read. I have fun with Holly, I like her a lot, but I don’t know if she makes me feel better.” Did Miguel make me feel better? In some very important ways, he did—the ones I’d thought, until this particular night, mattered most. But in one really important way, he made me feel small and lonely. The waiter came back with a big tray. All of our fried, carby, greasy food at once. He served the dishes around the table like a croupier. Everything was sizzling. “I want to be in love like that,” Walker said, digging into the big bowl of sesame noodles with his fork and plopping a mountain of it on my plate. “Me too,” I said. “I mean, I want that for you.” Showily, using my chopsticks, I took a big, delicious bite. “And I want that for you too,” he said. Which startled me; hadn’t I just said that was what I already had? I looked up straight into his teal-blue eyes, and I felt the power of his stare travel all the way through my brown ones and down my spine and shiver into my knees. What the fuck? After dinner, Walker walked me back to Hattie’s. I’d lied and told him that I’d left something behind, a purse or a hat, my pet poodle? Something that made no sense at all; I didn’t want him to know that I was going to sleep at Hattie’s because I figured Miguel would sleep at Angel’s, but I don’t think Walker was paying too much attention by then. He looked tired. And maybe a little drunk and sick from all that oily food and crappy wine. When we got to Hattie’s stoop, I asked him where he was staying. “With some lads I know from university; they have an apartment up on 14th.” He nodded to the north with his handsome head. And then he said, “You know, it’s rare to find someone so easy to talk to.” Was it? Maybe it was. I’d never dated anyone but Miguel, and he could chat up the moon. I didn’t know what to say. So I nodded in agreement and tucked away the thought for later. “Good night, then,” he said, leaning over and kissing me on the cheek. “Good night,” I said, my heart a wild bird trapped inside my chest as I turned and raced up the mountain of steps leading to Hattie’s apartment. The door was unlocked. And who did I find splayed out on Hattie’s Murphy bed but my Miguel. He was reading a copy of The Village Voice. “Hey, you,” he said, sitting up and swinging his legs over the edge to rest his feet on the floor. “Hey, you,” I said. “Where’s the Hat-ster?” “She went out with Emile and them. She told me you were coming back here later, so I waited.” He patted the bed next to him. I walked over and sat down. “How was the party?” I asked. “Pretty cool,” Miguel said. “I think that Jeannie wants to sign me.” “That’s awesome, Miguel,” I said, throwing my arms around him. He laughed and hugged me back, allowing me to snuggle down into my space under his left arm, near the armpit. “How was dinner with Walker?” he said. “He’s a nice guy,” I said. “He’s a good director,” Miguel said. He leaned over and tipped my face up, so I had to look him in the eyes. He pushed some of my curls behind one of my ears. “I hope tonight wasn’t too much for you,” he said. He never had any intention of hurting me, I’m telling you that now sincerely. Nobody loved each other more than me and Miguel. Love was not our problem. “It was, and it wasn’t,” I said. “You are my precious wife,” he said. “And you are my darling husband,” I said. Then we lay back on the bed in each other’s arms, and guess what? We fell asleep that way, both of us with our clothes and boots still on, like little kids. Around 3 a.m., Hattie came home, and she crawled into the bed with us. I was aware enough of her to roll over and hand her part of the duvet. As I said, in those days, the Herreras and Hattie Henderson were a family. There are nights that take you from A to C and nights that take you from A to Z. This night took me from A to W, to Walker. I mean, not right away, of course, but eventually. Inevitably. It was a slow and painful reckoning. And for me, a big motherfucking surprise! I know I’d thought something incredible was coming when I’d left Brentano’s earlier that evening, but never did I think it would carry me away from the man I loved with all my heart. Sometimes it takes forever to act on what you’ve already known for a long, long time. I imagine it was a little like quitting heroin: the highs, the lows, the anguish and the hunger. Walker waited patiently in the friend zone until, after a while, Miguel was either on the road working or “out” all the time. Crying on Walker’s shoulder when Miguel didn’t come home one evening led to making love on Walker’s futon in his apartment. What can I say? It was revelatory. Finally, I was enough for someone. When I got the courage to move out of our place and into Hattie’s, a protesting Miguel still helped me carry my belongings over to St. Marks. Little lambs that we were, we sobbed ceaselessly in each other’s arms, not realizing a sadder day was coming. In the meanwhile, Jeannie had been doing her job, thank God. Miguel had a great run after Fool. He went on the road as Horst in Bent; in Biloxi Blues, he played Eugene, with Jake Kaminsky as Arnold; and with his inky-black locks dyed sandy brown, he took the crown as Biff in Death of a Salesman on Broadway. During that time, he’d likewise moved on from Angel to Angel’s ex Bobby, and then to Marcos. I’d left, but I’d also set him free! There was a new kind of harmony between us. It was another year before Miguel tested positive. It took encouragement and hand-holding from Walker to get tested myself, so we did it together. I was shaking when they drew my blood, but Walker held me steady. When it was his turn, he just stuck out his arm. With that out of the way, we moved in together into a Mitchell-Lama sublet on First Avenue and East Second Street. Angel eventually gave up on theater and entered the world of fashion, and is alive today. As Miguel got sicker, Angel and I and Miguel’s mother took turns taking care of him. We hadn’t divorced, and even if we had, he would always be my husband. Sometimes Walker would accompany me to the apartment, and sometimes, when I was working, he also went on his own to visit. They were friends, in the end. As Miguel lay dying, I sat by his bedside, day after day after day, the two of us talking a blue streak like always. Once he stopped eating, the conversations stopped too, Miguel’s eyes glazing over as I read to him from his beloved Auden, from the New York Post. I sang to him until, one evening, long after he had stopped saying much, he shook his ravaged head, bald and spotted, unrecognizable, and said, “Mi amor, por favor, please, please shut up.” It was almost as if he’d come back from the dead. We burst out laughing. We laughed and laughed, our final laugh together. I’m the worst singer in the world. After Miguel died, Walker and I kept on working and building our careers. Eventually, we put a ring on it and had a little daughter. Kate. She is the light of both our lives. But from time to time, usually in the darkness of one of those sleepless nights of the midnight soul, I’ll text my old pal Hattie Henderson. She’s a mother of three now and lives a stay-at-home life in some shmancy town in Westchester—a lot’s changed, but a lot hasn’t. She is still my unpaid confessor. Like last night, when I wrote to her at 2 o’clock in the morning: Did you know I was fucking nuts back then? Hattie was up too. Like me, she has demons that no amount of bourgeois posturing can shake. At 2:15, she texted back: Everyone did! But all of us were kind of nuts then too. I wrote back: Don’t tell. It would kill Walky, but sometimes I still miss Miguel so much I bite down on my own fist until it bleeds. There were little red pearls pooling on my knuckles. I stanched them with torn pieces of Kleenex the way Walker did when he cut his neck shaving. Hattie texted back: You were meant for each other in a better place. Here on earth, it all pretty much sucks. Even though a lot of things are beautiful. I looked at my hand and saw that the bleeding had stopped. So I crawled back into bed and closed my eyes.

        "story": "You can see the buttes and mesas easily—see them from the road. But to see them in all their glory, you have to walk a ways off the asphalt. That’s true for the rest of it as well: the dried riverbeds, gullies, hoodoos, and hogbacks. The sky you can see from anywhere, but go farther into the land and it becomes bluer, deeper, and the whole shebang becomes just stupidly scenic, like something a cartoon roadrunner would paint to outwit a cartoon coyote. Meaning death might lurk behind every vista. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. My father and I used to go out there together. The “together” being a concession to my mother, a concession granted bitterly and retributed upon me in various ways. He would hunt. Desert mule deer, mostly. He didn’t say much to me on those trips. No life lessons. It was mostly us tramping around, him shooting, animals dropping, me bearing dumb witness. Out among arroyos, beneath the steepled skies … That line came to me once on such a trip. On that particular outing, Dad had been worse off than usual, and when our car wove into the lot and stuttered into park, he listed over, hat falling. I listened to the dash beep for a full minute before I turned the key from the passenger side. The engine pinged a while. And when it was clear that he wasn’t waking up anytime soon, I got out and walked off into the scrub alone. I walked and walked. The buttes came into focus. Up closer, they were ribbed, like a bunch of lady-giants gathering in their skirts (and I thought of that line, about “the giants” and their “skirts,” then too). Anyway, back on that hike of mine, I was intent—as I often was as a teenager—on trying to write something, in this case about the sanctity of the landscape I was then toiling through. And by the time the sun was all the way up, I was sitting on a rock in the shadow of one of those behemoth formations, still trying to tie together those themes. I couldn’t make the poem work. Yet that day, on my own, without my dad’s oppressive squint, and without the silence-splintering gunshots, the world opened itself up before me, and though I couldn’t wrangle that poem into anything usable, I was just full of metaphor. As the sun moved, I moved with it, and I came eventually all the way up to touch that great butte, where I plopped down again. Ate my lunch. Drank most of the powdered tea. Saw clouds complete a full passage across the sky. The shadow receded. I kept having to move to stay inside it. I wrote some more. After a while, out in the scree, it occurred to me that if Dad hadn’t woken up, he’d be frying in the car, maybe dead. So I put my notebook away, gathered myself up, and went back. I was panting and half dead myself by the time I got to the lot. Car was gone. I walked home beside the highway—took the whole rest of the day, into evening, to get there—tee tied above my charred brow, canteen empty, head swimming, hot metal shrieking past. That night I had to sleep in a full tub, and the pain of those burns didn’t subside for a long while. After my father lost the ranch, he took whatever job he could find, landing finally on insurance, meaning he sold it. Sold policies to dry cleaners, quick-service food operations, down-market rodeos, strip clubs, pool-maintenance firms, bowling alleys, lube joints, moving companies, wrecking crews, pawnshops, lumberyards, sewage-removal units, taxidermists, pest-control outfits, massage parlors, go-cart tracks, gas stations, brick-facers, laser-tag arenas, drive-ins, that place that sells local shit on Interstate 23 (meteorites, Native memorabilia, petrified wood), the Motel El Rancho, the barbers and the ladies’-hairdo spots, spirit vendors, pet groomers, general contractors, karate dojos—that is, whatever small-business interests managed to stick it out through the long drought and downturn, the same one that forced him off his land. He did not love his new life, it’s safe to say, as it is safe to say that risk assessment and liability were not the subjects of his childhood dreams. Horses and cattle were, and the thwarting of those dreams—the daily defeat of unattainable desires—accounted for much of the serious mean he had on him (the drink accounted for the rest), and by the time I was 10, he could be red-faced and despicable all the way from breakfast through bed. We never saw him for dinner, but sometimes after, when I was already tucked in, I’d hear that stammering tread, and wince. His unpleasantness was rank, a herd in the parlor, trampling and snorting, squeezing the rest of us into tight spaces, or straight out of the room. Then the next drought. And the next slump. Everything blighted, including those local concerns, and so too the selling of insurance. Money, always a hardship for us, became a desperate need, and notices began appearing—first in the mail and then on the door—at the new place we rented in town. Then came the death of my mother’s sister back East from cancer in her uterus, with her parents following not long after. And next, one result of the mounting losses, came my mother’s discovery of Christ. This was completely out of nowhere, and calamitous. Calamitous for two reasons, one of which was that it drove a wedge between her and me, as though she had newly birthed—and then favored—a whole other son. Soon after, she ceased reading books, once her daily bread: gave up reading them to herself, and reading them to me, her (true) son, just as she gave up all of those wonderful and various words she tendered to me for my benefit. Impassive. Wan. Burnish. Epitaph. Susurration. Cumulative. Staccato. All language, that is, that wasn’t dictated by the Lord in his book. She also ceased using that sweet, teaching voice of hers, and spoke to me instead with a disappointed-sounding voice, as if I was beyond hope. When had I got beyond hope? I thought. I had already begun to recognize that when she spoke to me in that new delivery of hers, she was not in fact speaking to me at all, but to those, generally, who had not seen, and never would see, the holy light (a company of the condemned, which also included the squirrels, the detergent, the porch, the desert, the sky, the dead). The second calamity was that her newfound path antagonized my father, who had always stored up and slung his trademarked nastihoods at the faithful, taking their ways and manners as a personal affront, as if they were leveling accusations. And so he would spout off about those who would collude in mockery of him: —Hell’s better than church. Just as Mom became “raised up,” his degradation metastasized into true hate, and he became even more “lowered down.” Barely seemed possible then, though by now, at my age, I’ve seen that there’s always room in a body for more poison to drink. He started to appear in all kinds of places where he had no business being. He was found in the town dump. He was found asleep in a parked bus he had broken into. Once, inside the car wash, the one with the colorful, riffling little flags. They were about to turn the machines on—the hard, hot bristles; that steaming rubber octopus—when someone saw him lying down there. Several times he passed out in a public park and quite a few times ended in lockup. On some of these occasions, we were the ones who found him. Those were the lucky times. Mom always cleaned him up after, her expression strangely more satisfied than ever—a look of blushing fulfillment as she scoured him from top to bottom in the tub. And so we maintained. Maintained through that whole year, until the new minister took over at the church on Holland, a church that my mother was then just beginning to attend. That’s what finally did it for us. Or started to, anyway. We found out about the new minister on a day Dad and I had come home early from hunting. My father had expended all his rounds into the dirt and air, having missed every living thing, missed because the sun was too fierce, Dad too unsteady. He was already in a dark state on the drive home, and I was treated to short bursts of well-rehearsed invective about who exactly should be blamed for his ill fortune, his conclusions on this matter having nothing to do with himself, but rather focused on a blurry band of cutthroats, teat-suckers, and layabouts who fully intended to rob him blind of everything he loved, owned, and, most importantly, was owed—him being owed everything from his rifle to his undershorts, his commemorative-coin collection, his bolo, his brown liquors, his slurs and spurs, his Tiparillos, his gasoline, his hamburger sandwiches, his lawn chair, his pomade, the hitch in his stride, the music that sprang up in his Pontiac mid-twang as soon as he turned the key, his drawl, his self-reliance, that famous mustache of his, his pocket change, his confetti of lottery tickets, the deed on the old ranch. At heart, this “owed to him” was mostly (what he saw as) his position at the top of the pile, this bit coming in direct contravention of another lecture of his, concerning the importance of initiative, an initiative he never showed a lick of himself (a lecture I would entitle “Get-Off-Your-Ass,” or, often, “Where’s-My-Fucking-Beer?”), and why anyone as train-wrecked and delinquent as my dad should be owed a single cent for his lousiness was hard to square. But of course I never said anything as he went on and on and on until we pulled in the driveway. And as we entered the house on that day, I heard the muted cadence of pleasant conversation, a thing as strange to hear—as out of place in my home—as the sound of an ocean suddenly lapping gently at the front yard. The minister was sitting down to a soda with my mother in our kitchen. Or rather, he was rising quickly as we entered—in the manner in which polite men might, when caught out alone with a woman. Pushing his chair away, backing up a tick. He even stuck his hands up and pumped his palms, smiling, as if to say, Whoa there. —I’m Reverend Monroe. I was just telling Eileen about our new ministry. I thought to wonder if I’d ever seen a Black man in our house before, but looking at one standing there, I became damned sure I had not. Dad looked perplexed, truly taken aback. The world took a breath. —Come join us, my mother said, patting the seat beside her. But my father’s look had shifted. And he was suddenly, dangerously amused. He gave a dry laugh and said: —It’s so kind of you to look in after my wife. —James was just telling me about his work overseas, said my mother, overly quick. —James? said my dad, eyes of slits. I felt then the release of something bitter and cold, a hazardous vapor—like the liquid nitrogen from a coolant truck. I spun around without anyone even noticing. Went out the front door, and the wind closed it behind me such that I involuntarily jumped over the three steps down to the pavement. I started off east. I found myself at my best friend Dill’s. We spent our afternoons out in the culvert those days, living on jerky, throwing rocks at other, bigger rocks. Clinging to railway trestles and feeling that thunder above. Dill and I ended up going to the mini-mart for bottle rockets and snappers and then went to the parking lot to expend our ordnance. I wasn’t home again until the evening. When I did get there, I headed upstairs. My father’s voice cannoned out at me from the living room. —Where is your ma? it said, and I knew this as demand, not question. I searched the house, and then went back into the darkening streets and visited the neighbors, but she wasn’t anywhere. I came home—empty-handed—and luckily Dad was asleep on the couch, his back hunched away from the entrance. I took off my shoes and finally got to my room. The next day, I learned that Mom had been at the clinic in town. Dad was, as usual, God knows where. But there was Mom, back in the kitchen, humming something and wiping down a counter. She turned and I saw. A week later, she returned to that church on Holland. This was willfully unwise. But it was an expression of hope, and at least someone in that disfigured family of mine was drawn to consecrated places. Of course there was an aftermath. Another one. A bigger one. And I have decided to let that all happen offstage and I certainly don’t intend to continue making a big federal-style case out of it. Except for one aspect of the smacking-around (Mom’s, mine), which is this: the overdeveloped sympathy that I feel for Dad, a prime example of my ability (or need) to inhabit the shoes of another, even the shoes of the antagonist, though such shoe-borrowing can be kleptomania, a disease. Now, I’m not saying I forgive. No. I am sure I do not. But anger and resentment do not prohibit my exploring my father’s corroded heart and finding in myself, if not love, then some understanding of the hateful engine that drove him. And so, despite the unseemliness I feel around it all (which, given that I am a card-carrying commiserative, must seem odd, but believe me when I say I do worry that these stories of my youth are too maudlin, even for me, a very duke of mawkishness), I will tell some more (if only a little). Only one more instance, and this was when Dad hit me in front of Mom, and because of Mom, and I did not hit back, and how that—as it were—set a tone. I was slightly older then—must have been around 17. I had been spending an increasing amount of time out of the house, for the usual reasons, those being Dad, and one day had been invited out by my teen associate Marvin Grosvenor, whose cousin had a car we could borrow to drive with Dill to the dog track over in Coolidge. We did that. Spent the day at the dogs, lost some money, won some, and lost it again, and after, we went to the culvert to shoot our mouths off and shotgun beers. I came home pretty late, which wasn’t a thing as Dad was out and Mom had choir practice. But the following morning, the phone rang, and I could hear through the floorboards the indistinct sound of my mother’s voice, and as the pauses between her speaking became longer, and the pitch dropped to something lower and more serious, I began to fret. When I came downstairs, she told me that Marvin’s mother had called. Turned out the car we’d taken had not belonged to Marvin’s cousin, but had been Mrs. Grosvenor’s own—that it had not been so much borrowed as hijacked, and that Marvin, when confronted with evidence of his crimes, had spilled the beans on me and Dill, not just for the joyride but also for the gambling, the beers. The total rat. And as I stood there under the kitchen’s exceedingly bright lights, captive to a litany of my transgressions, I considered the notion that I’d rather be slapped around than see my mother so dispirited. —Shame on you, is what she said. And I felt it. That hot shroud of shame. Still, I found myself saying then, as fatigue and hangover began to encroach upon reason, as if someone else had got hold of my vocal cords (and shame-heat being so proximate to anger-heat): —It’s none of your business, Mom. (Shame: redoubled.) At that moment, Dad walked in. —What’d you just say to your mother? —Nothing. —Wasn’t nothing. —Didn’t mean it. My mother made some small noise. —Fuck no, he said to her, and she did not say or do a thing. Then, turning toward me and stepping up closer, he whispered: —What you got, boy? I looked at the floor, saying, quietly as I could: —… And the fist hit me on the right cheek. When I got to my feet again, the thing of it was—not pain but—the feeling I had experienced of skin on skin. What I mean to say here is that the punch was shattering, yes, like all the others—I don’t think he ever touched me except to hit me—but shattering because of how intimate this one was. I had smelled his breath and seen the individual bristles on his chin, the marbling of his eyes, the birthmark on his brow. It felt (I am embarrassed to say it) almost romance-like. A shared secret. Skin on skin. The rough, hairy ridge of that man’s knuckles meeting my smooth cheek. He swung again, but I had put my arm up by then, and so it was more of a glancing thing, and then a grapple, which increased our congress to an unbearable level as I could feel the ambient warmth coming off him, his scent and sweat, hear his heavy snorts (and I wonder now if he felt what I felt in that moment: that beneath his fury were the dim traces of other, kinder embraces. I doubt it, but I know now that such belligerence-judo is always a kissing cousin to a tenderness-judo, and so it is with some men, and so it has always been, and so it always will be, and anyhow). I pushed away and stood up fully. —You want more? he said, but gasping. I realized at that moment—with the fast and fierce intelligence of a cornered animal—that if I were to punch back, I would score a few hits of my own, more than a few, and good ones, as I was by then big and strong enough, which I think he, in that wild moment, clocked as well, because he looked even angrier then, squared up as if he could have well and truly killed me. And I believe he could have (and maybe would go so far as to say definitely would have) had there been something to swing at me then, anything at all instead of his bare hands. And I don’t mean the extension cord or that belt he favored, but if he had: … a coffee mug or a beer bottle or a pipe or the bronze statue on our mantel of the man riding the bucking horse, a regional insurance award that he had won—way back somehow and against all reason—or one of the two table lamps, or a claw hammer, or a chair, or a leg from a chair, or the TV remote, or one of his two guns, or a kettle, or the fire poker, or the phone receiver, or a loose doorknob, or a tire iron, a paperweight, a letter opener, a kitchen knife, a bowling ball, a rake, that old rail spike he kept as a memento of a prelapsarian age, a rolling pin, a crowbar, a baseball bat, a broom handle, a can of soup … That is: I used to do such an inventory of the house, tracking items in it according to their potential use as weaponry. But though I could see him look around quick (milk carton, dish towel, cigarette pack), he had nothing at hand, and so I was able to duck and slip around him and be out of the kitchen before anything more could happen, him shouting hellfire after me, though I know now that I ran not because I didn’t think I could take him, but because I could have, and I needed that whole sick, combative closeness to end. I ran, landing back up among the buttes and mesas. So that was grievous and lousy, seriously so, and I do not forget how grievous and lousy it was. And it was several years later when I received that automated message on my machine that went: To this day I do not know how exactly it went down for him, as I had not cared to inquire. But now I do wonder. And I imagine a hard end for Dad there, given the setting, and I think about how, in my nightmares, the eyes of my father became the frantic ones of those destroyed deer, and I feel bad, but then again, he earned his end—all of us are our own arsonists of the world—and so with regard to him, I rarely reproach myself for those moments of ill will and nasty thinking. But still, still: It should also be said that I am, occasionally, reminded of the way back—when the suit and tie were still new to my father. Memories of kindnesses, strewn like a scant handful of seed. Memories of the view from his shoulders. A sing-along. Before life roughed him up. When he still dressed for the office. Those moments actually happened. They stopped, of course, but at first he would teeter between the loving and the violent, and even exhibited the two overlapping, in that he might cry as he pulled out that extension cord and called for me. I still don’t know who his tears were supposed to be on behalf of, but I think of them as a prime example of the thin boundaries between feelings, how they can come together, like anger and shame, and feed on one another. That day of (what was to be) his final attempt on me, I heard my mother’s voice as I ran from the house, and I looked over my shoulder, and caught through the diminishing doorway a momentary sight of him, red-faced but also: wet-eyed … and these eyes have become almost like an emblem of the whole event, a sign for it, the thing it strangely comes wrapped in. That is, when I think back on it all, wincing, I dwell upon his wet eyes. Those wet eyes, though, I’ll think. Those wet eyes. This story has been excerpted from Peter Mendelsund’s third novel, Weepers. It appears in the July 2025 print edition. "

        "story": "It was damp down under the blackberry bush, but Margaret liked it there; she was cozy, like a rabbit. It smelled clean—it was funny how dirt could smell so clean. She couldn’t see in the dark which berries were ripe, but she nibbled on one anyway, puckered, spat. She rested her cheek against her arm and looked across the yard. A whoop and a stampede—the boys were running by. They must have spotted Biddy. The bright spot of the flashlight whirled. It made her dizzy trying to follow it. Hammock, grass, basketball net, grass. The flashlight made a photograph each time it hit something—little circles of backyard, punched out of time. The light lit the door of the toolshed and stayed there, wobbling. She couldn’t tell which boy was which in the dark, but one held the flashlight, one went for the door. Tactics, she thought, impressed. They shouted and knocked over some rakes and buckets, but the shed was empty. Margaret laughed into her elbow. The boys stopped to scheme. They had to be more strategic, she could hear Neal, her own brother, saying. She played with a stick in the dirt, making up notes for the fairy people who would come out later, telling them who she was: Here lay Margaret, child of man. The fairies would have tangles in their hair and see-through wings of dusky violet and the pointed toes of Barbies. She didn’t believe in fairies, but she liked to pretend. The light came again, straight into the blackberry bush. For a second it was like being inside a room when someone flicks the switch. The world got solid and sharp-edged and jumped at her—leaves and thorns and shadows of thorns, the dirt so close to her face and suddenly, specifically, dirty. She cringed her eyes shut tight so no one could see them shining like an animal’s. When she opened them again, the boys were on the other side of the yard. They’d given up on the ground and were looking into the trees. Biddy would be in a tree; Margaret could have told them that. And it took only a few more minutes before the light found her best friend, pinned her up against the branches. Biddy swung down to the victorious brothers. But they would never find Margaret. She had known as soon as she burrowed down under the blackberries that no one was going to find her. She was too low to the ground, too good and hidden. It was fully dark out now. She couldn’t see the bats against the sky anymore, the bats that lived in the attic and weren’t all bad because they ate the mosquitoes. If she was outside after her own dinner, looking up, she could catch them sometimes sluicing out of the house, so many wings so close together it was like one streaming body, like the house was a factory churning out black smoke. They were up there, eating, but she couldn’t see them. She tried pretending them away, but that never worked; you could pretend things into existence but not out of it. The damp had soaked through her shorts and she shivered. She was bored of flashlight tag. Elbowing her way out from under the brambles, she shouted, “I win, I win,” and, linking arms with Biddy, skipped toward the lit-up house. The parents were on the porch, around the glass table. “Ice cream’s inside,” Biddy’s mom called to the oncoming children. “Bring me a bowl too, would you?” Margaret’s dad asked her. The fathers were handsome in their off-hours polo shirts, but Margaret’s father was handsomest. And in the doorway her mother, in the hot-pink sundress—Elizabeth, commanding the screen. Elizabeth oversaw the children tramping through, but when Margaret reached the threshold, she put an arm out and stopped her. “You’re filthy,” she said. Margaret looked at her mother’s face to see how she meant it. But it was safe, she didn’t look angry; she looked as if she was thinking of a cute word, like ragamuffin. Margaret glanced down. Her knees were brown, but filthy? Elizabeth was always exaggerating. Besides, this was clean dirt, blackberry dirt. She toed off the heels of her sneakers and lined them up beside the door the way she was supposed to. She said, “I’m not filthy.” A mistake. Dumb, Margaret. “You are literally,” Elizabeth said, “covered in mud.” I’m not, she thought again but did not say. “Look at yourself.” Elizabeth pinched at her T-shirt as if she had to touch it but didn’t want to. The shirt lifted away from her chest and the air came in. “Take your clothes off here and give them to me. I don’t want you tracking that mess through the house.” Margaret looked around the porch, at the parents, at the brothers on the other side of the door. “Here?” “Don’t be a princess.” Elizabeth took the hem of her T-shirt and pulled. Automatically Margaret’s arms went up, like she was still a little kid who was used to being undressed by her mother. The shirt covered her face, and for a moment it was safe, she was back in the blackberry bush, in the good dark, but then the air was on her. Elizabeth had said she’d buy Margaret a training bra when she started fifth grade that fall. She didn’t need it for support or anything yet, but you could see that she would soon; you could see already that she wasn’t a child or a boy. “Skin a rabbit,” Elizabeth said, reaching for her shorts. Then Margaret was through the door and up the stairs in her white underwear, moving fast so she couldn’t see anyone seeing her. Behind her, Elizabeth was her good mother again, bundling up the dirty laundry, saying to the other kids, still gathered by the door, “Don’t forget to put the ice cream back in the freezer. I don’t want ichor all over the countertop.” Icker? Margaret repeated the word as she climbed up on the bathroom sink, contorting her knees under the tap. It was a new word. Ick, ick, icker. It meant “filthy” too, she guessed. Her mother had many words for that, and she was right: Margaret was filthy. The dirt ran down the sink in pleasing long, brown lines. But Elizabeth wasn’t mad that she was filthy; she was mad that Margaret had said she wasn’t filthy. Icker on the countertop, she said to herself, liking the sound of the words. Biddy’s nipples were a pale ballerina pink, but hers were much darker, almost brown, an ugly color. It meant her boobs, when she got them, would be bigger—that’s what Biddy said. You always feel sadder when you look into a mirror. It’s because to the sadness in yourself is added the more generous sadness you feel for another person. Poor thing, Margaret thought about her reflection. The girl in the mirror looked like she was suffering from something much worse than whatever was bothering Margaret. It was weird how the ins and outs and shapes and holes clustered at the front of a head made up something this nakedly expressive of thinking and feeling—the face. All that thinking and feeling, Margaret knew, was what Elizabeth was talking about when she said, Stop making that face. Stop making that face, Margaret thought now at the girl in the mirror. She wrapped a towel around her chest and started to leave the bathroom. She needed to get dressed; Biddy would be waiting for her. But she stopped at the door and went back. Carefully, with wet toilet paper, she wiped everything down, each thing she’d touched: the sink, the hot tap and the cold, the honey-colored marble that she’d sat on. She had turned the bar of soap brown. Under the clear water, she cleaned the soap itself. She would never again know so little or have so little to do. Neal had Model UN camp all summer and Biddy had swim team, but Margaret wasn’t doing anything. She emptied and loaded the dishwasher, took out the trash, emptied and loaded the dishwasher. She read, endlessly, in the yard, books about special children doing magic. She daydreamed about Danny, and about JTT from Home Improvement, and about Calvin O’Keefe from A Wrinkle in Time. She owned a book of poems called A Child’s Garden of Verses. It had a red fabric cover and had belonged to her mother growing up. On the inside cover, in a schoolgirl cursive significant as a celebrity autograph, she had written the name Elizabeth. Margaret knew a lot of the poems by heart, and sometimes they played in her head like pop songs. She liked even better a poem that her teacher had read to her: Margaret, are you grieving over Goldengrove unleaving? That was a tree. She said that to herself a lot. Margaret, are you grieving? Oh! It was beautiful. Her historical education came primarily from the American Girl books, which is why she associated the Revolution with redheads climbing trees. About slavery, she knew that it was very bad and long ago; about politics, she knew only the president’s name. She knew about abortion, or at least that people carried posters about abortion. She knew who Kristi Yamaguchi was. The family had one computer, in a corner of the living room, which she had to use to play a game that taught typing and the multiplication tables. Twice with Biddy she had braved the alarm of the dial-up to go on the internet and been equally bored and disturbed by what they’d found there. In health class she had colored in diagrams about puberty but had no idea what it would feel like when her own body changed. They made it sound like it was all little things, hair and pimples, pores and follicles. But she knew it was a bigger deal—more like disappearing, cell by cell, until you were replaced by a whole new body. She often wondered: What was the point of her? She was 10 years old. One morning, as usual, Margaret was lying in the yard when a car pulled fast into the driveway and Mrs. Ricci from down the road tumbled out. Mrs. Ricci and her mother were friends, but not really. If Elizabeth was watering the flowers by the road, Mrs. Ricci would slow down in her car and say, Your roses are bliss. But the families had invited each other over only a few times. The Riccis lived in a giant brick house behind an iron fence with a driveway that went in a circle around an actual fountain, which Elizabeth thought was very ostentatious, but that was not to be repeated. “Margaret, get your mother. It’s an emergency.” She ran around the corner, shouting, “Mom!” Elizabeth was in a flower bed, putting things in or taking them out. Elizabeth strode down the driveway; she would take care of what was wrong. Margaret stopped on the porch steps, a polite distance away. “Lost,” she could hear, “… sometime last night …” Something must have happened to one of the Ricci boys, some gruesome injury, because Elizabeth was hugging Mrs. Ricci, pressed her tight against her chest. One of Elizabeth’s hands was on Mrs. Ricci’s back, rubbing up and down. Margaret watched in wonder the mother in her mother’s arms. The only adult she’d ever seen cry before was Elizabeth. “We’ve looked everywhere,” Mrs. Ricci said, pulling away. “What if she was stolen?” Stolen? She who? Elizabeth, having given comfort, was all action. “Have you called Animal Control? Don’t worry, she’ll turn up.” It was an emergency, but it wasn’t the boys who were missing. It was Gambol, their pet pygmy goat. Gambol lived in a pen in the Riccis’ backyard and in theory ate sugar cubes and peppermints out of the palm of your hand, though the few times Margaret had been over to the house, the goat had refused to come anywhere near the fence. They had the goat because Mr. Ricci was allergic to dogs and cats but it was important for children to grow up knowing how to take care of animals. Mrs. Ricci said that as if the goat made the house a farm, like the boys were up at dawn with a bucket in each hand, though everyone knew that this was New Jersey and only pretend. The goat had a pink collar that read Gambol, and her name was also on a gold plaque on the gate of her pen, the gate that Mrs. Ricci was saying now had been mysteriously opened in the night. The goat was so tiny—only as tall as Margaret’s knees—not just tiny but freakishly so. People wouldn’t expect it. They would run her over in their car before their brains said, “What was that? Was that a little goat?” Now an old man Margaret didn’t know waved from the end of the driveway. He walked toward them. He had gray curls, like her dad’s would someday be, and work boots, and a big, hard belly. “Daddy,” Mrs. Ricci said. “Saw the car from the street,” the man said. “I walked the road from the back and didn’t spot her. Expanding the search party?” He shook Elizabeth’s hand. “I’m Stu Elkins, Jeannie’s father. Visiting from Maryland.” Elizabeth called Margaret over. “Why don’t you help Mr. Elkins look around on foot while Mrs. Ricci and I drive,” she said. She didn’t want to. With a stranger? She wanted to stay with the mothers. But it wasn’t a question. “I’ll bet you’re a kid who knows all the secret spots around here. That right?” he asked as they started walking. It was already too hot, the sun stunting their shadows. “I guess.” “Now. If you were the world’s tiniest goat, where would you go?” “I would find somewhere with lots of grass …” “Yup.” “Or clover. Somewhere cool.” “I’ll bet that she’s barely made it off the property. Let’s do another sweep, yes?” He led her back to the Riccis’ house, and around the side. There was the stone patio and the barbecue grill. There was the goat’s pen, with its suspiciously wide-open gate. There was the wall of hedges that encircled the pool, and then beyond it the industrial-size lawn. The house and the yard were too big, she thought, like the goat was too small. They were made not for function or survival, but for something else—to make an impression, to overwhelm or endear. Only someone very rich could have things so frivolously big and small. “I’ll take the right side, you take the left?” “Okay,” she said. What was the goat’s name again? Something dumb. Glitter? “Here, goat, goat, goat,” she called, clicking her tongue like for a cat. She looked through the flower beds, under all the landscaping. The more she looked for the goat, the more she wanted to find it. She would bundle it into her arms and present it to the mothers. She was proud to have a test, a quest, a purpose. The dads and the boys had gone. The goat would bleat, and she would find it, save it, keep it safe. But it wasn’t there. Maybe it didn’t want to be found. She had gone all the way down to the end of the lawn and all the way back up again, and she was thirsty. She wanted to go put her feet in the pool; she couldn’t get in trouble for taking a little break. She went through the hedges and kicked off her sandals. She swished her legs up and down so the cold got in around every toe. Then she looked up. The goat was lying under one of the deck chairs. In the slats’ striped shadows, it looked weirder and wilder than she’d remembered. She’d imagined it a sweet lamb, all silky wool and soft, rooting nose, like the lamb that sat in Mary’s lap in The Secret Garden. But it wasn’t a lamb, it was a goat, and not just a goat, a pygmy goat. She had thought that being small and fragile would make it cute, but up close it wasn’t cute at all. It had dirty gray hair and odds-and-ends-looking legs, joints that made her think of tangled-up bone, and staring yellow eyes too far on either side of its face. She did not want to bundle the goat in her arms. It didn’t look like a creature that could be bundled. It looked like it might bite or die. She felt no desire to protect it. If anything, she felt the opposite: repulsed and somehow threatened. The animal kept looking at her, without fear or curiosity. The pupil in its eye was a thick horizontal line, like someone had drawn a strike through the eye, tried to cross it out to start over. There was something wrong with the goat, or something wrong with the world to have made it. Its defenselessness was a kind of test, a test that everyone was going to fail or had already failed. The fact that it was so easy to hurt made her feel that someone, maybe Margaret, would have to hurt it. The sun caught the gold on its collar and glinted. Silently, she crept out of the hedges. The old man had been the one to return the goat to the pen. He didn’t pick it up. He just hooked a finger under its collar and tugged until it came. He gave Margaret full credit. “Of course it would have been lounging by the pool, like every other kid in this family.” He winked, because “kid” was a pun, and getting the pun was almost as good as finding the goat. Mrs. Ricci ran to it and fell on her knees and nuzzled its weird face. The goat just stood there, tolerating the caresses, the flat line in its eye never wavering. Margaret and her mother stood together at the fence. Elizabeth’s mouth looked funny, like she was moving something gross around inside it, something that tasted terrible but she wasn’t rude enough to spit out. A heavy, satisfied feeling settled over Margaret’s head and shoulders. She and her mother had something in common: They felt the same way about the goat. They could never have loved it like Mrs. Ricci loved it. As a thank-you for finding the goat—the poor thing could have drowned!—Mrs. Ricci invited them all for a swim after Neal and the Ricci boys got home from their camps. So in the early evening they went back, Margaret heroic in her navy-blue Speedo. The younger boy, Philip, was nice about it: “We heard you found Gambol. Mom must have been freaking out.” His brother Jeremy held his palm up and wouldn’t put it down until she submitted to the high five. The boys were throwing around a Nerf football while Margaret bounced on the diving board, delaying the moment of entry. The water was so clear, it might have been a sunk pool of nothing at all. She was just up there, mindlessly boing-ing. It was nice to be sprung into the air, to jump without trying. At the top of each bounce, she could see over the line of hedges, over the prestigious lawn, and down to the road at the bottom of the hill with a tiny stop sign at the end of it as if to say: That’s it, you can’t see any farther. Then down she would go and then up again, ever so slightly higher. She noticed suddenly that the pool was quiet. The boys had funny expressions, like someone had made a joke. They were looking at her, watching … what? She came down from the bounce—it seemed to take forever to come down—and twisted her ankle on the edge of the board in her hurry to get off it. Water everywhere, water up her nose. Stupid pool water, why did it have to be so clear? There was nothing to hide behind but her own exhaled breath. She brought her knees to her chest in cannonball position and floated there, refusing to surface. But suddenly, underneath her, two hands on her ass. She had never thought the word ass in relation to her own body before, but now for the first time she did, and just thinking the word seemed to change her body, as if the muscles there tensed into a new shape and would not relax again. Two hands on her ass lifting her up, up through the water and flinging her out of it into the air. The air stripped the water from her skin and her legs flailed open and so did her eyes. She was up in the green landscape of the hedges again, but not high enough to see above them. The black sheen of the boys’ heads went by below her, round as river stones. And then down: She hit the surface halfway to the shallow end. She had always loved being thrown in the pool. Her dad would toss her and she’d buoy up laughing, demand to be thrown again. But this was different. “Don’t touch me,” she said. “Just messing around,” Jeremy said. She looked at Neal. “Chill,” he said. It wasn’t clear if he was talking to her or to Jeremy. “Hey, catch,” Philip called, and held the football up in one hand, cocked it back, mimed the spasm of an arrested pass. But his brother ignored him, and so did hers. “Hey, Jeremy,” Philip tried again. “Let’s play.” Jeremy lowered himself so that only his nose and eyes were above the surface. “I don’t want to be thrown,” she said. He ducked his head under and swam. Something about his too-broad white back coming toward her freaked her out. It was like a shark but grosser. The ripples made the edges of the colors wiggle, the blue of the tiles penetrating the skin and the skin penetrating the tiles. He just wanted to play. What was the big deal? But she couldn’t bear for him to touch her again. She kicked backwards, but there was nowhere to go; she was trapped between the pebbles of the pool wall and the smooth, rubbery wetness of his body. “What the fuck did you do?” Jeremy shrieked. Now Jeremy was the one sputtering out of the water like something had shocked and hurt him there. Across his chest and shoulder were red lines, dark with blood, each scratch surrounded by spreading, stinging, valentine-pink, as if trimmed with a border of ribbon. She lifted a dripping hand out of the water and turned it around, inspected her fingernails. A lot of his skin must be under there. Right then the mothers walked up. Margaret swished her hand underwater. Mrs. Ricci had a pitcher and cups on a tray, Elizabeth a pile of white towels in her arms. The mothers looked young in an ancient way, Margaret thought, like in a painting. She looked hard at the mothers so she didn’t have to look at Neal or Jeremy. It had something to do with their bare shoulders, and the miniature green leaves of the hedge behind them, and the white stone under their sandals. They looked like temple serving girls painted on a wall. Behind them came the empty-handed old man. Elizabeth placed the towels down on a chair, and then she saw Jeremy. She looked from the cuts to Margaret and back again. “Margaret! Did you do that?” She looked at Neal, and he shrugged: Yeah, it was her. “Why were you playing so rough?” “He threw me,” she said. “So?” asked Elizabeth, genuinely baffled. “Apologize to Jeremy. You hurt him!” Whatever credit she had gained was gone. She had saved the goat but scratched—perhaps scarred—the boy. He heaved himself out of the pool and the mothers bustled around him. They pressed a white towel against his chest, as if they needed further proof that the blood was real. When it came away red, they looked even more surprised. The old man had sat down on a lounge chair, and he was looking at his daughter, who was looking at her son. Margaret couldn’t tell what he was thinking. He was wearing swim trunks and his white legs were skinnier than she’d expected. Under his chair, the shadows lay in jungled stripes. Elizabeth stepped to the edge of the pool. The sun was behind her. “Apologize,” she said. Her hands twitched, but she couldn’t reach Margaret; she was too deep in the water. “Come here right now and say sorry.” Margaret took a step forward but then stopped. No. She wouldn’t come. “Come back here this instant. Come back here or you’ll be—” Margaret had reached the other end of the pool. She reached her palms behind her on the edge, and ascended, and scooched her new ass backwards. “Margaret, don’t you dare.” She wouldn’t come. She wasn’t sorry. She was running, running away, not bothering with a towel. She had made those marks in the surface of the world. She had not been thrown again. She ran through the hedges and down across the lawn, grass clippings sticking to her feet and legs, knee-socked in the cut-down green.

        "story": "At 5:41 p.m., Holly texted me, Leftover kale salad from dinner, already dressed, you want? A follow-up text: Also one corn dog but assume you pass on that 😋 I’ll take both, I texted back. Awesome, now? she texted. I replied with 👍👍, rose from my desk, walked from the back of my apartment to the front—I was renting the first floor of a house on the east side of Madison—and stepped outside. By the time I reached the bottom step of the porch, Holly was waiting for me, holding a pale-blue dinner plate with a corn dog and a matching kale-filled bowl. She passed them to me by extending her right arm as far as possible, and I accepted by doing the same. Was this necessary, 17 months into the pandemic, outside, with both of us vaccinated? Probably not, but it was all so confusing; it was August 2021, and there’d just been breakthrough cases on the East Coast that revealed you could be vaccinated and still get it. As a pediatric ER doctor, Holly had been the first person I knew to receive the vaccine. “Do you need ketchup?” she asked. “I have some. Did anyone projectile vomit on you today?” “I had a 12-year-old with a fishhook in his cheek. How’s your TV show?” This was how she referred to the pilot I was writing, even though I’d explained the differences between a spec script and a series people watched. “It’s getting more brilliant by the minute,” I said. “I’m trying to decide where I’ll put the Emmy.” She grinned. “I vote for the mantel.” I nodded toward the plate. “Is the corn dog homemade?” “God, no. It’s defrosted and not even by me—by Ted.” “I feel like this is a perfectly balanced meal.” “Morally or nutritionally?” “Yes,” I said. “Exactly.” “By the way—” Holly lowered her voice to a whisper, though she was speaking emphatically. “I weighed myself this morning, and I’ve crossed the Rubicon! You know what I mean? All the numbers in the odometer have turned over. I didn’t even cross the Rubicon when I was pregnant.” I shook my head. “Sorry, but I’m not impressed. I’ve weighed a lot more than I do now.” Her expression was skeptical. “How much more?” “Forty pounds? Now I have a fake job that allows me to spend three hours a day walking around and listening to podcasts instead of saving kids’ lives. But I promise I’m not exaggerating.” “Over the weekend, I put on a pair of shorts, and it wasn’t just that they didn’t button. They didn’t zip! I’m like, How did this happen? And then it’s like, hmm—” Holly pointed toward the plate. “Could it possibly be the corn dogs? Could that be contributing to the problem?” “I don’t think we need to villainize corn dogs,” I said. “Corn dogs are people too.” She laughed. “I thought you were going to tell me, ‘Everything in moderation.’” “Well, sure,” I said. “Also that.” She’d resumed speaking at a normal volume, but once more, she lowered her voice to a whisper. “I ate three tonight!” “I think that just means something inside you needed three corn dogs.” “I told Jake I’d watch his new magic trick in a minute, but want to walk Comet with me around eight?” “I’d love to,” I said. Inside, I set Holly’s plate and bowl on my kitchen table, took several pictures of them from different angles, washed my hands, pulled a can of beer from the refrigerator, and sat at the kitchen table eating—first the corn dog, then the salad. The outside of the corn dog was sweeter than I’d expected, and I was pretty sure the dressing on the kale was homemade. It was so good that I’d have asked for the recipe if I was the kind of person who made my own salad dressing. While I ate, I played a word game on my phone. Then I washed the plate and bowl and left them in the drying rack. I returned to my desk, which was on the sunporch at the rear of the apartment, and instead of going back to the script I’d been working on when Holly had texted me, I opened my email. I typed the names of my agent, my agent’s assistant, Chandler Quinn’s agent, her agent’s assistant, and her manager, and wrote the message I’d been composing in my head for almost as long as I’d been working for Chandler Quinn. I already knew that my agent, whom I liked even though she didn’t conceal that I was a low-priority client, would be annoyed by the lack of advance notice. Hi all, just want to let you know that I’ve made the decision to move on from my role as Chandler’s social media manager. The term I used in conversation, when I was violating the NDA I’d signed—I did this both sparingly and at regular intervals—was ghostwriter, but manager was the word in my contract. I believe that this means I need to provide four additional weeks’ worth of content after today (taking us through 9/12/21), but let me know if there’s anything else to discuss. I knew I should add a positive, even grateful, sentiment, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I sat there for more than a minute, looking at the yard behind the house—a squirrel without a tail, one I’d seen so many times before that I thought of him as a kind of rodent co-worker, was running along the top of the wooden fence—and finally I added, I hope you’re all hanging in there. I’d left Los Angeles on March 17, 2020, after reading multiple articles about a point that would arrive in L.A. when a person could call an ambulance and wait in vain for it to show up. In fact, that point did come, but not until late December. Back in March, as I loaded my car, the last thing I did was unplug my desktop computer, set it inside the biggest tote bag I owned, and carry the bag to the garage of my building in Echo Park so it could ride next to me on the passenger seat. I didn’t know where I was going. There was a time when I’d have headed north to Oakland, where my sister, Jenny, lived with her husband and their 7- and 11-year-old daughters. But now my sister was barely speaking to me. Our parents were no longer living, and most of my friends in L.A. were also married with kids, and seemed to have their hands more than full with online school. My closest single friend, Nora, had decamped to Florida, pulled her 92-year-old mother from her super-spreader nursing home, and moved them both into an Embassy Suites. I headed northeast. That first night on the road, after crossing Utah, I stayed at a hotel off the highway in Grand Junction, Colorado, and when I woke up in the morning, I thought, Madison. Though I hadn’t been back since graduating from UW more than 20 years before, I figured my familiarity with the city would prevent me from becoming completely untethered to the rest of the human species. Before checking out of the Grand Junction hotel, I’d found a Madison Airbnb, and when I parked in front of the house a day and a half later, after a night at a hotel in Omaha, a boy in a blue T-shirt and a chartreuse helmet was riding his bike in circles on the street. As I shut my car door, the boy asked, “Are you the renter from California?” “Yes,” I said. “You can’t have any pets,” he said. “Not even an iguana.” “Does the Airbnb belong to your family?” I’d chosen it hastily and could remember only that it had a sunporch. He nodded, then pointed to the house next door to the Airbnb, a forest-green Craftsman. “We own that one too, but we don’t rent it out. We live in it. Have you ever had sleep paralysis?” “I don’t think so.” “Sometimes people see a demon sitting at the end of their bed. It’s not dangerous, though. It’s a harmless neurological disturbance.” “How old are you?” I asked. “A lucid dream is when you know you’re dreaming. You can train yourself to control what happens in lucid dreams, but there’s a risk you’ll develop sleep problems. I’m 10. How old are you?” “I’m 44. I think I’d remember it if I’d ever seen a demon sitting at the end of my bed.” “Do you have kids?” “I don’t. In addition to not having pets.” “Why not?” “I like kids, but I never really wanted to be a mother.” Was this an inappropriate way to talk to a 10-year-old? I wondered if my sister would disapprove, which hadn’t been a thing I’d wondered much before our estrangement. “My mom’s a pediatric emergency doctor, and my dad takes care of the rental properties. I have two half sisters because my dad used to be married to someone else, but they’re grown-ups.” This was when a woman appeared on the porch next door and said, “Jake, you better not be asking her if she’s ever had sleep paralysis.” To me, she said, “Bethany, right? Welcome to Madison. I’m Holly. Have you eaten yet? We ordered too much pizza, if you want some. And we didn’t touch the pieces we didn’t eat, if you’re worried about that.” From his bike, Jake said, “She doesn’t have any kids or pets, and she’s a year younger than you.” Then he rode away. I glanced at my watch and, seeing that it was 20 minutes past five, said, “Sure, I’ll take a slice of pizza.” I wondered if they were having a late lunch or an early dinner. Soon, within a week or two, that would seem like a preposterous question. Comet was a mix of border collie and a few other mystery breeds. As we headed toward the park, I said, “So I finally emailed my agent a couple hours ago to say I don’t want to do the Chandler stuff anymore, and about five minutes later, I got word back that Chandler wants to have a face-to-face meeting.” “No shit she does!” Holly said. “Because you’re awesome!” I’d never been certain if the great enthusiasm Holly expressed about any job-related tidbit I divulged was a form of midwestern politeness—Holly had lived in Madison her entire life, except for college at the University of Minnesota—or if it was guileless excitement about Hollywood. “When?” she asked. “Unclear. I still hate her, though.” “What are you going to wear? Do we need to go shopping?” “It’s a Zoom,” I said. “Not that it would matter what I wear even if it were in person.” “What the hell? She should fly you out there.” “If it makes you feel better, I bet she’d meet with me in person if I were in L.A. But it’s not worth it to get on a plane.” “It might be worth it to see the inside of her house.” “I’ve been in rich people’s houses before,” I said. “They’re big and uncluttered.” “I’m so jealous.” Holly laughed. “Not of the ‘big’ part.” I hadn’t entered Holly’s house until I’d been in Madison more than a year and had been vaccinated. It was medium messy—not tidy for sure, but no worse than my sister’s house in terms of shoes and coats and mail by the front door, or random containers of croissants or rotting bananas on the kitchen counter. Over three nights, Holly and I had watched the entire season of a reality show about people trying to survive in the Amazon rainforest, but the week before, after the COVID breakthroughs on the East Coast, she’d said we should stop going in each other’s houses again. “Chandler’s like a shitty boyfriend,” I said. “Now that I’m done with her, she probably wants to tell me how into me she is.” “Did you ever ask to meet with her before? Maybe she didn’t know you wanted to.” “I don’t want to. And no, we’ve never met, but she posts pictures of other people on her—” I made air quotes “—‘team.’ Like her hair-and-makeup person or whoever. Not a lot, but occasionally.” “But she has to keep you secret, right? So everyone thinks your cleverness is her cleverness.” The observation wasn’t incorrect, and I was quiet as Comet sniffed the base of a cedar tree. After a few seconds, I said, “I’ve never once had direct contact with her in almost five years. At some point, I’d have appreciated it if she thanked me. Not publicly, but privately. And not with, like, a letter written on linen paper. Just send me a fucking fruit basket.” “Oh, she definitely should have sent you a fruit basket,” Holly said while Comet lifted a hind leg. “The fancy kind with pineapple and kiwi. I’m going to look online and come up with some ideas of what you should wear for your Zoom.” “That’s a horrible use of your time.” “Possibly,” she said. “But more fun than reading an article about cytokine response in zero-to-18-year-olds.” “Then let me know what you find.” It had taken me about seven minutes, one night in 2017, to crack the 40-something-actress-on-social-media code. The reason I cracked it so efficiently might have been that I’d just taken an edible, then eaten two-thirds of a pan of Rice Krispies treats before finishing my application to be Chandler Quinn’s social-media ghostwriter. Or it might have been because I also was a white woman who came of age in the 1980s, and the code wasn’t subtle. Either way: The posts that did best from middlingly successful, middle-aged Hollywood actresses had the ostensible point of, Look how silly and dorky and harried by my kids I am. The subtext was, But based on this photo, look how thin and attractive I am. So it would be a woman wearing a fuzzy orange bathrobe and matching slippers, eating (or presumably “eating”) a doughnut, and it would read “#SundayVibes,” but she’d clearly had her hair and makeup done by a professional, and the belt of the bathrobe was tightly cinched to show her slender waist. Or a woman sat on the floor of a toy-strewn playroom, a nearby toddler and a slightly older child captured mid-jump off a couch, with the caption: They claim it ALL sparks joy. The woman’s prettiness and thinness didn’t need to be explicit; you could glean it from her cheekbones or wrists. This is the hike I went on today with my bestie (while being thin).  This is the not-overtly-sexy-but-actually-extremely-form-fitting caterpillar Halloween costume I wore to my kids’ school (while being thin).  I woke up like this (while being thin). My application notwithstanding, being the ghostwriter for a middlingly successful actress wasn’t a job I wanted. The job I wanted was one I’d thought it would take me a year or two to get after I’d moved to L.A., which was to work in the writers’ room of a show I watched for pleasure. Instead, over a decade and a half, I’d been on the staff of nine unfunny family comedies while annually writing my own pilot, which usually got optioned and never got made. When my agent, who worked at the same huge agency as Chandler Quinn’s agent, had called to tell me about the opening with Chandler—it was not, for obvious reasons, an advertised position—she had said, “Maybe just for some pocket money? You could do it in your sleep.” Probably not coincidentally, Chandler also seemed then to be past her prime, which perhaps she also had failed to recognize as such until afterward. She’d been a supporting actress—the best friend in more than one megahit—for 20 years. Though she looked younger than me, she was two years older—in 2017, I was 41, and she was 43—and I suspected that in deciding to “ramp up her socials,” as my agent put it, Chandler was trying to extend her on-screen expiration date. For five original posts a week, subject to the approval of Chandler or her representative, the pay would be $30,000 for six months, no benefits, and the terms would be renewable if mutually agreed upon. I’d provide photos only if no people were in them; otherwise, they’d be taken by a member of her team (by her 23-year-old assistant Becca, I soon found out, after Becca and I exchanged 12 texts to discuss whether the parsley I’d mentioned getting stuck in Chandler’s teeth [while being thin] was curly or flat and which teeth I envisioned it between). My writing sample for Chandler’s agent and manager had been 10 posts. On the night I worked on them, Chandler had 88,000 followers on Instagram and 23,000 on Facebook, and wasn’t on Twitter. (I had 1,407 followers on Twitter under the handle @JoanOhioRivers, a nod to my upbringing in Pittsburgh, and wasn’t on Instagram or Facebook.) I wasn’t sure if it showed due diligence or just seemed creepy that I’d looked up the real names and ages of Chandler’s kids (Declan was then 7, and Madelyn then 5), but I went with due diligence; because she was divorced from her director ex-husband, I didn’t need to ponder him. Idea 1: Photo: CHANDLER, DECLAN, and MADELYN stand at their kitchen table, a platter showing a rocket-shaped cake that’s very lopsided and phallic. Chandler is dressed casually in matching leggings and a sports bra, hair in a ponytail. Text: “Nothing weird about putting this ‘rocket cake’ in my mouth, am I right?!” (Could include second photo with slice of half-eaten cake and additional text: “Update: It was delicious!”) Idea 2: Photo: CHANDLER sits on the floor in butterfly pose while DECLAN and MADELYN have a pillow fight in the background. Text: “Yoga is so calming. 🙏🤪” Idea 3: Photo: A selfie CHANDLER has taken from the driver’s seat of her car, with DECLAN and MADELYN visible in the back seat, all of them holding food in wrappers from a fast-food or fast-casual chain (Burger King? Chipotle?). Text: “Just another home-cooked meal consumed at our elegant dining room table in our spotless home! 🤣🤣” Thirty-six hours after I’d emailed my ideas and the signed NDA, Chandler’s agent’s assistant reached out to schedule an in-person meeting with her agent and manager, and two days later, I was offered the position. I accepted and violated the NDA that night by describing the gig over drinks with my friend Nora. In the afternoon, while I was walking around Lake Mendota and listening to a podcast about a cult in Washington State, my phone buzzed. Holly had texted me a screenshot from the website of an upscale professional women’s clothing brand. The model was wearing white palazzo pants and a cropped orange sleeveless sweater. Holly’s next text read: For Chandler Zoom I texted back, You really don’t have to do this From her: Performed a needle thoracostomy this morning on 14yo, need distraction From me: Okay but I never wear sleeveless A link followed for a floral blouse with long sleeves. From her: Why not? From me: Jiggly upper arms From her: Should this undermine your cred as my body positivity coach? From me: It should make you respect how hard-won my cred is From her: Who are we kidding, I’d never want to be friends with someone who isn’t hypocritical Yet another link came in, for a knit short-sleeved sweater. From me: Srsly this is such a waste of your time From me: Morally and nutritionally From her: Probably unworthy of a celebrity but if you’re in mood for more fat-me-downs, last night I found possible shirt From her: Silk turquoise blouse Standing beside the lake, I Googled needle thoracostomy then texted Holly: Why needle thoracostomy? From her: You should definitely wear sleeveless. I’ve seen your upper arms and they’re 🔥🔥 From her: Unresponsive after ATV accident From me: Will kid be ok? From her: I hope so For a period of 48 hours after I’d accepted Holly’s leftover pizza on my first afternoon in Madison, I hadn’t spoken to another human. I’d ordered groceries, which were left on the front porch; I’d watched the third season of a prestige cable series, then gone back and rewatched the first and second seasons, planning to take notes on how the writers made the dialogue land, especially for the final line in each scene, but repeatedly becoming so absorbed that I’d forgotten to; I’d taken walks wearing a mask, and when I’d approached another person, I’d preemptively stepped off the curb 20 feet ahead of time. That first day, I’d exchanged phone numbers with Holly, then saved her in my phone as Holly Landlord. On the evening of my third day, I received a text from her: How tall are you I texted back, 5’7” From her: Went through my closet over the weekend, have some pretty nice clothes that don’t fit anymore. Want to see? From her: I believe the term is fat-me-downs From her: 😂 A few minutes later, we were standing eight feet apart on my porch, each of us rooting through a garbage bag. The clothes were indeed nice, certainly nicer than I needed during a pandemic and probably ever—silk blouses, wool twill blazers and matching pants—and I kept most of them. “I used to think dressing professionally at work mattered,” she said. “I’d had a mentor who came up in the ’70s, when there were way fewer female physicians, and she convinced me of it. Then one day, and this was a couple years ago, nothing to do with COVID, I got vomited on for the hundredth time, and I was like, Screw it. I’ve been wearing scrubs ever since.” As we sorted through the bags, we discussed our jobs, my time as an undergraduate in Madison, how people in L.A. wore parkas when the temperature fell below 60 degrees but people in Wisconsin didn’t wear them when it was below 20, and the surreality of the shutdown. She said that the most sacred part of her job was when a patient had a horrible diagnosis, like a brain tumor, and she was about to enter the room and tell the family, knowing their lives would change. Then she said that the previous evening, she and Ted and Jake had had a movie-and-popcorn night, and when she’d put on her pajamas before bed, she’d found a corn kernel in her bra. I explained that Echo Park was about 20 minutes east of Hollywood, and that Hollywood wasn’t really where major celebrities lived. Then I thanked her, and she returned to her house. Ten minutes later, I texted to see if she wanted to come back to my porch for a beer or a glass of wine. Immediately, I regretted it and was filled with the same graspy feeling I often had as a journeyman TV writer at a party with showrunners. Thirty seconds later, Holly texted back, I thought you’d never ask! I sat on the porch steps, and she sat in a lawn chair in the grass, facing me. We both were drinking a bougie local beer from aluminum cans, and I was telling her about a movie star who’d been a heartthrob in our youth and was now close to 60. Holly said, “So his marriage to that girl was fake or not fake?” “It depends on your definition of fake,” I said. “If we assume that he’s a narcissist—a talented and hardworking narcissist, but a narcissist—and also that he’s been living in a weird fame snow globe since the mid-’80s, I don’t think that kind of person has the capacity for what most people would consider a relationship.” I took a sip of beer. “Not that I should talk.” “Have you been married?” I shook my head. “Engaged five years ago, called it off, nothing serious since.” “Do you want to be in a relationship?” “Less than I can possibly convey.” There were a few seconds of silence, then I said, “I’ve wondered if I’m asexual.” I’d never previously said this aloud, but maybe what happened in a pandemic stayed in a pandemic? Or did it matter if it didn’t? She nodded as neutrally as if I’d said I was a pescatarian. “I know this isn’t what asexual means, but—” She lowered her voice. “Half the time when Ted and I do it, I’m like, This is great, it’s hot, I’m feeling it. And the other half of the time, I’m like, This heaving, flesh-slapping sweatfest is revolting. We’re doing this voluntarily? For pleasure? I assume it’s connected to my menstrual cycle.” “There’s a reason Shakespeare called it making the beast with two backs.” Holly grinned. “I’m so glad my fat-me-downs will have a second life with you. Some of that shit was expensive.” “I can tell.” “I can’t believe I’m about to admit this, but right after the New Year, I was in the grocery-store checkout line looking at one of those magazines about people who’ve lost huge amounts of weight. I thought, What if I pretend to myself that I used to weigh 500 pounds? Like instead of now being the most I’ve ever weighed, I act like I’m one of the success stories and, through careful diet and exercise, I’ve lost over half my weight.” She looked at me intently and said, “That’s so fucked up, right?” I shrugged. “It’s a little fucked up, but I’m in no position to judge. I’m like the poster child for yo-yo dieting. It sort of comes with the territory of writing for TV, because you’re either working 16 hours a day and surrounded by craft-services food, or you’re on hiatus and have all the time in the world to exercise and plan your meals. The most I ever gained during a season was 33 pounds, and the least was 12.” “Then how do you lose the weight?” “Every method that exists. I’ve tried them all. Intermittent fasting, low-carb, paleo, three smoothies a day.” I hadn’t at that point tried Ozempic, but only because it wasn’t widely available and I didn’t yet know it existed. To Holly, I added, “It’s all so fucking boring, right?” “Hmm,” she said. “Maybe demoralizing more than boring? But does it bother you when your weight is higher?” “No, because I’m immune to the cultural norms our patriarchal society has imposed on women in order to undermine our self-esteem and waste our time.” I rolled my eyes. “Of course it bothers me! I guess I assume that most women our age have a moderately to intensely disordered relationship with food. I read fashion magazines growing up, and any clothing spread back then would be, like, four anorexic white women, one anorexic Black woman, and one white woman who was probably only moderately anorexic and was presented as plump and curvy.” Holly laughed. “When my friend Gina and I were in sixth grade, her aunt told us that if we stood naked in front of the mirror and jumped up and down, if any part of our body jiggled, it meant we needed to lose weight.” We both chuckled darkly, and Holly added, “But is it really any better today?” “I think it’s better and worse. Women appear in ads now who really are curvy, not just curvy compared to anorexic, or who have vitiligo or a prosthetic leg.” “True,” Holly said. “But what about the cesspool of social media?” “Do you know who Chandler Quinn is? The actress?” Holly squinted. “Maybe?” Obviously, this meant no, which I found gratifying. “I have a side hustle being her social-media ghostwriter,” I said. “She has a sitcom called The Chandler Show, and if you’ve never seen it, that means more of your brain cells are intact. Anyway, I write her posts for Instagram and Facebook and stuff.” “Cool!” Holly said. “Actually not,” I said. “The opposite of cool, in fact. But it’s easy money.” “You know how there are women of our grandmas’ generation where they could have been an astronaut if only they’d been born 20 years later? That’s how I feel about body positivity. Like, love the idea of it, too bad I missed out.” I laughed. “Maybe in our next lives.” In the 17 months since then, Holly’s son, Jake, and I had had countless conversations about telekinesis, UFOlogy, Sasquatch, and the Titanic; I’d exchanged nothing but passing greetings with Holly’s husband, Ted, usually when I ran into him as he was leaving for or returning from a bike ride, and I’d directed any renter questions I had to Holly herself; and the only fat-me-down I’d worn was a yellow puffer jacket. And then I wore another fat-me-down for my call with Chandler, a white button-down shirt, and the funny thing, though not funny ha ha, was that Chandler, too, was wearing a white button-down, but mine was from Ann Taylor circa 2015 and Chandler’s had probably cost $800. The room she was in was large and very light—it was three in the afternoon in California and five in Wisconsin—and three framed prints of birds hung in a row on the wall several feet behind her. “Bethany!” Chandler said with great warmth. “My alter ego! Hello, hello, hello! Is it okay if I virtual-hug you?” On-screen, she held up both arms and wrapped them around nothing. Flatly, I said, “Nice to meet you too.” Of course I’d joined the call first and waited for her; I’d wondered if her agent and manager would also be present, but neither of them was. “Sheila said you’ve been riding out the pandy in Wisconsin,” she said. “Is that where you’re from?” Sheila was Chandler’s manager. “Where I went to college,” I said. “I’m from Pittsburgh.” “Well, I wish I could have you to my house for lunch. I make a mean deconstructed shrimp salad.” I was tempted to point out that we’d lived 10 miles apart for the first three years I’d worked for her, but I just said, “I’m not much of a shellfish eater.” I sounded to myself like my dad at his most gruff and awkward, which had been extremely gruff and extremely awkward. Chandler smiled a broad and very pretty smile. She had dark hair, big eyes, high cheekbones, and a square but delicate jaw, and I assumed she’d had work done on her face, some smoothing or plumping or buffing, but a sign of the quality was that I wasn’t certain what work. “So,” she said, “thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me seem cool and funny and way smarter than I am. Do you know why I thought we should never meet?” The confirmation that she really had been keeping me at a distance was weirdly validating. “No,” I said. “I don’t know.” “Because from the beginning, it was so obvious that you were writing a character. A chill, funny mom character. And I wish I were more like her, but I’m not, and I worried that if you knew that, it would make it harder for you to come up with material.” “Do you know I’ve written for TV forever? And I’m well aware the characters aren’t real people.” “But I’m a real person.” She paused. “I want to be like your idea of me, but I’m way more vain and grumpy.” While I did find this claim endearing, I was unsure, as I’d been with every celebrity I’d ever met except the outright rude ones, of the proportions of her sincerity and her pandering. She continued, “When the folks at the agency told me you don’t feel appreciated, seriously, it made me feel awful, because I’ve always appreciated you so much.” “Just to be clear,” I said, “I didn’t tell the agents I feel unappreciated. I quit.” “No, right,” she said. “I’m trying to say that I get it. If I were you, I’d be frustrated. But I want to share how this all looks from my perspective. In 2014, within a week, I find out the show I’m on hasn’t been renewed, my husband leaves me, and I turn 40. I know I’m not telling you anything you don’t know when I say the industry wants to put women like me out to pasture and replace us with 22-year-olds with perky tits. But what I try to do, what I hope I have done, with your help, is rewrite that narrative. I’m like, you know what? No. I’m going to have a second act. I’m going to be honest that life is sometimes shitty, and at the same time, I’m not going to let the shit define me. I’m going to make lemonade and tell my own story. And I’m going to use my platform to bring in other women and elevate all of us. I feel grateful as hell for the role you’ve played in allowing me to do that, and if I haven’t conveyed that, my bad.” Looking at her pretty face over Zoom, I wondered if I could triple the amount I was being paid. Not that I’d ever discuss numbers directly with her, but wasn’t she all but encouraging me to take it up with the agents? And I could feel how easy continuing to be her ghostwriter would be, like sinking backwards into a soft couch. Instead, I said, “When you talk about elevating other women—how would you say you’re doing that?” Her eyes narrowed, and I perceived her perceiving me. Perhaps until this point, she’d thought I was merely awkward rather than antagonistic. In a markedly less warm tone, she said, “For starters, I’m on the board of I’ve Got You.” This was a recently formed and widely mocked nonprofit in which established white women in the entertainment industry mentored women of color. “I also do a lot with the DONNA Foundation to promote breast-cancer screenings. And I try to work with female designers and jewelers for my big events, not that any of us have been doing events for a while now.” I could feel the adrenaline in my bloodstream. Was I really about to do this? Apparently I was. “The posts I write for you are formulaic,” I said. “Right? We can both admit that. And the formula is a self-deprecating sentiment juxtaposed with your attractiveness. And I guess that’s not inherently wrong in theory, but in practice what both of us are doing is showing off how thin and hot you are in a way that makes normal women feel bad about themselves, because it doesn’t acknowledge how much your appearance is tied to your financial privilege and your staff and all that. Even noncelebrity women who are privileged themselves and smart enough to know better—even they feel like you’re the standard of how someone in her 40s is supposed to look and like they’re gross or failures. A specific woman doesn’t need to follow you on social media for you to be part of reinforcing this dynamic in the culture.” “Wow.” Chandler blinked a few times, looking almost amused, then didn’t say anything else. “I’m complicit,” I said. “Or I have been. But I don’t want to be anymore.” “Just so I understand,” Chandler said, and I knew from her inflection that even if I wanted to continue as her ghostwriter, the option was, as of the past few seconds, no longer available, “you’re holding me personally accountable for the fact that film and TV actresses are expected to be thin?” “It’s not the thinness per se,” I said. “It’s the disingenuousness. At this point, I’d be more comfortable writing posts for you that are like, ‘This is my workout and this is the juice fast I do.’ It’s the posts that show you about to eat a huge carrot muffin that you supposedly stress-baked, and you’re saying, ‘No, seriously, it’s for the vitamin A,’ but I assume you ate between zero and two bites.” I wasn’t sure if she’d know I was referring to a real post—if she’d remember it, or if she’d ever seen it to begin with. “Do you think I don’t eat food? I eat food.” The claim made me almost certain that by my definition, she didn’t—that in a given day, she ate, say, a handful of nuts. What person who ate food needed to affirm that she did? I said, “Remember the post about how, once you had a daughter, you made this vow to yourself to never insult your body in front of her and how it helped you realize that you should have been practicing kindness to yourself all along?” “Of course I remember it,” she said. This had been her most popular post ever. With particular depravity, I’d started it, “Real talk …” and I’d known it would be well received, though I’d underestimated its popularity. “I took that from my sister,” I said. “She’s the one who made that vow. She has two daughters, one who’s 8 now and one who’s 12. I’d borrowed other stuff from my sister before. I always thought she got a kick out of it, but she was very upset that time.” In fact, after the post had gone up, even before it had gone viral, Jenny had texted, I don’t appreciate you stealing my life, and I’d called her immediately and said, “But you’re my muse. I’ve used stuff from you a bunch of times.” “No shit,” Jenny had said. I was genuinely taken aback. “If you didn’t like it, then why didn’t you ever say anything?” “Why was it my responsibility to tell you I didn’t want you using my experiences for some vapid actress’s self-promotion? Anyway, I’m telling you now.” “I’m sorry,” I said. “I definitely didn’t know it bothered you, and I won’t do it again.” “I also want you to take the post down.” She said this casually. “I can’t,” I said. “Why can’t you?” “I’m not the one who literally hits ‘Share.’ It’s an assistant. I don’t even know Chandler’s passwords.” “Then ask the assistant.” “The way my contract is set up—trust me, I can’t.” A silence ensued before she said, “It’s so messed up that you cashed in on a heartfelt promise I made to myself to be a good mother and role model.” “You know that in writers’ rooms, people vomit out details from their lives all day long and they go right into the scripts?” I said, then added, “Even though I can’t fix this mistake, I really won’t do it again.” It occurred to me that Jenny could write her own post for her 126 Instagram followers about what I’d done, and at some level, I hoped she would—despite Jenny’s tiny following, such a post could also go viral, and in doing so reveal that I’d violated my NDA and result in my termination—but what Jenny did instead was cut me out of her life. A month later, when I asked about the timing of my visit to Oakland for my older niece’s 11th birthday, Jenny texted back, Let’s sit this year out. Two months after that, things shut down. Before leaving L.A., I’d texted Jenny to ask how her family was doing, and she’d replied, Surreal, Annie and Val’s school is going “virtual” after spring break So strange! I’d replied. Thinking of getting out of L.A. Wish I could invite you to come here but just doesn’t feel right, she replied. You’re still mad because of the Chandler post? I asked. Not mad, she replied. Uncomfortable with your cynicism I didn’t respond, and a minute later, as if clarification was necessary, she added, Just don’t want that energy under my roof Over Zoom, I said to Chandler, “I apologized to my sister, but she basically still isn’t speaking to me, even though it’s been a year and a half. She wanted me to take the post down, and I tried to explain that I couldn’t, but I don’t think she believed me.” Chandler made an almost-expression that probably would have been her brow furrowing if she hadn’t had procedures that precluded a furrowed brow. “We can take it down,” she said. This wasn’t what I’d expected. “That’s not the point,” I said. “Also, since it went viral, there are screenshots everywhere. The toothpaste is out of the tube on that one.” “Did you apologize to your sister?” “Repeatedly,” I said. “Do you have other siblings?” I shook my head. I knew that Chandler had an older brother and sister, both of whom had normie jobs—the brother was a nurse, and the sister was a real-estate agent. I’d once written a post about both of Chandler’s kids trying on Auntie Lauren’s heels. “Were you and your sister close before this?” Chandler asked. “I thought we were each other’s best friends,” I said. “You really need to make it right with her,” Chandler said. “There’s no substitute for family. Now that some time has passed, maybe you could write her a letter?” A part of me wanted to say, Do you not get that this is all your fault? Another part of me recognized that none of it, not even a small bit, could be blamed on Chandler. “Then again,” she said, and her tone was musing, not hostile. I knew it was unlikely I’d ever speak to her after this in any context. “Sometimes you have to let people figure things out on their own.” I was walking along Lake Mendota when Holly’s text came in at 6:30 p.m. I have an idea of how to celebrate Chandler call I replied, No need to celebrate We didn’t make amends Or whatever Still owe her 11 posts but it’s done Holly replied: That IS reason to celebrate right? It’s what you wanted? On the path along the lake, I stopped. For a long time, it had been strangely hard for me to distinguish between successes and failures. I typed, What’s your idea From her: Hot fudge sundaes From her: I’m at Hy-Vee rn getting ice cream From her: Meet in half hour? From me: Okay, my porch? From her: Do you like maraschino cherries From her: Yes your porch From me: Yes cherries “You know the other night when you gave me the leftover corn dog and kale salad?” I said. “I took a picture of it. How would you feel if I turned it in as one of my remaining Chandler posts? Be honest. I mean, I ate them too. They went into my stomach.” “Oh my God.” Holly’s voice was ebullient. “Like, my corn dog would be famous? That would be the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. Which shirt did you end up wearing?” “Your white button-down from Ann Taylor,” I said. “Classic.” “She was wearing a very similar shirt. White and everything.” “Except hers for sure wasn’t Ann Taylor.” “I had the same thought. You realize that you won’t be credited for the corn dog and kale? The world won’t know it was yours.” “I’ll know,” she said. “Can I see the picture you took?” We were sitting on opposite sides of the top step of the porch, with pale-blue ceramic bowls on our laps and the sundae ingredients, including a melting pint of high-quality vanilla ice cream, between us. I pulled my phone from my pocket and held it out to her. She removed her glasses, peered at the screen, and said, “Gorgeous.” I set my phone down on the porch and we both were quiet, and it was a warm, perfect midwestern summer night punctuated by the sounds of cicadas and leaves stirring in the breeze and the shouts of kids down the street. After a few seconds, Holly said, “So Chandler sucked?” “Unfortunately, I didn’t dislike her as much as I’d planned to.” Holly laughed. “Bummer. But you still quit?” “I’d already quit before we Zoomed. I just didn’t unquit.” After a beat, I added, “Which means I need to get hired for another writers’ room before I run out of money, which means I should start thinking about heading back to L.A.” The whole time I’d been in Madison, I’d been paying two rents, which was doable if I was Chandler’s ghostwriter and not if I wasn’t. “Don’t writers’ rooms exist over Zoom now?” Holly said. “Some do. And I’ve thought about that, but I’m afraid if I don’t return to the world of people pretty soon, I might never be able to. I might go around some bend.” “I don’t want you to go around a bend that you don’t want to go around,” Holly said. “But it sure won’t be as fun here without you.” “Yeah.” I exhaled. “I’ve always wanted to say—and it’s never seemed like the right moment—and this will probably sound totally weird and grim, but it’s true.” I paused, which again made the summer-evening noises audible. “If I hadn’t met you during lockdown, I hope that I wouldn’t have killed myself, but I think I might have.” “Oh gosh,” Holly said, but there was something in her Oh gosh that wasn’t shocked. “That’s the darkest compliment I’ve ever gotten.” “It’s the darkest compliment I’ve ever given.” “Do you still think about killing yourself?” “No.” I was telling the truth. “In this moment, I feel happy.” I gestured with my spoon at the bowl on my lap. “This is so fucking good. I kind of forgot that hot-fudge sundaes exist.” Holly laughed. “I feel happy right now too,” she said."

        "year": "2025",
        "story": "The woman and her sister had been out jogging by the river when they saw the bird fall from the sky. At first, they mistook it for a falling leaf, but the angle and speed of descent suggested a weightier object. They squatted down like children to inspect the body. A pale-green bird with a cream-colored breast, too delicate for a city bird. They saw nothing above them. No trees or obstructions, just a red fog of diffuse and muddled light. Poor bird. Why would a bird fall out of the sky like that? It was small enough to have balanced on a single blade of straw. They knew almost nothing about the daily lives of birds, save the pigeons who scampered about, pecking at urban detritus. During mating season, the males chased the females up and down the sidewalks, hopping on, hopping off. If they had seen the dead bird in a state of decay, they would have simply sidestepped it. But because they’d witnessed the moment it struck the ground, they felt somehow responsible, as though it were a piece of trash that had blown out of their hands. Shouldn’t we at least put it off to the side, the woman wondered aloud. Don’t do it, her sister warned. You don’t know what it has. They left the body, casting a few backward glances. The brief stop made it more difficult to continue running, so they walked for a stretch. The path along the Hudson River was almost empty at that hour. A flock of seagulls bobbed on the water, penned in by a rhomboid of lamplight. A crow perched mutely on a wire. Before the interruption, she had been telling her sister about the artist. You know, the artist. I profiled him in the magazine several years ago, she reminded her sister, when he was working on the windmill installation? Remember, I shadowed him for a week, and then we took that trip to Montauk? Now he’s back in town to install a new show in Chelsea. Some kind of sculpture—a machine. The woman’s sister was staring at her phone. She frowned at the lit screen, typing rapidly. What is it? the woman asked, waiting. The concentration on her sister’s face made her wonder if everything was all right. What happened? Her sister finally looked up. Oh, we ordered a mattress online and now it’s arrived. The screech of wet bicycle brakes. Water slapping against rock. Her sister was saying, Honestly, it took us forever to decide. Weighing the environmental impact of a new foam mattress versus a used one, cost versus expediency and guilt. A plane roared overhead, lower than normal, heading to LaGuardia, perhaps. The sky was so woolly, she imagined the runway materializing at the last minute, filling up the entire windshield. A plunge of faith before the tires hit tarmac. The pilot must have a way of knowing where the ground is, she thought. Or the plane’s apparatus must know. What were you saying just now? her sister asked. Oh, yeah, the artist. The artist who’s coming to town. What about him? I can’t believe you’re still talking to that creep. In a rare confluence of irregular schedules, the woman and her husband were having dinner together at home, discussing the details of his upcoming birthday party. It was an unremarkable middle-age birthday, and he didn’t want to make a fuss. A small gathering at the German beer hall, he finally decided, and friends could drop in as they wished. So, I’ll tell everyone Wednesday, he said, because Thursday I have class and Friday I’ll be gone. What’s on Friday? The woman looked up. I already told you. I’m going to Connecticut with Miriam. The woman’s phone buzzed on the table. Her sister: I Googled the dead bird. But I can’t Wednesday, the woman said. I told that artist I’d see his installation. Apparently migratory birds get confused by high-rises that emanate light. The storm exacerbated things. Her husband, scraping off the dishes: Come when you’re finished, then. Can’t take that long to— A muffled notification pinged on his phone, and he reflexively put a wet hand to his back pocket. The one we saw could’ve been some kind of warbler. Or vireo? Okay, don’t steal my idea, but listen to this, he said, picking up the spatula again. Office hours, but for dating. Birds navigate by feeling the pull of the Earth’s magnetic field. Why keep up this fake pretense that each date is somehow brand-new, virginal? Line them up. Drop-in model. Thank you, next. He was gesticulating wildly for effect. Are you experiencing such a volume of matches on your app that you’re wishing for a more expedient model of vetting and exploiting people? The 9/11 memorial endangers thousands of birds every year. Very funny. What’s the arrangement you have with Miriam now, after your little incident? I’m not judging; I’m just curious if she requires you to get tested regularly. The birds fly around the light, unable to extricate themselves. We said we wouldn’t talk about details. They waste precious energy and can die of exhaustion. And I wonder how you’ll explain to everyone why you’re spending your birthday weekend with her, not with me. I’ll tell them my wife is very principled; she doesn’t believe in the birthday industrial complex. She believes only in radical transparency, and in emotional blackmail when it suits her. Put homing pigeons in a dark cage, take them out to sea, and spin them around and around until they’re sick. They’ll still find their way home. Why do you insist on going through with this? You were the one who wanted this, not me. I guess if you want something badly enough, you generally find a way. Throat gonorrhea be damned. Her husband threw the dish towel on the counter and went into the other room. The woman watched him leave, and wondered whether memory had once served as a kind of homing mechanism. Pillars of light. Remembering how things used to be. Her mother had told her, over and over, Don’t look at your phone in a dark room. It’s terrible for your eyes. If you have to read, turn on the lights. She looked over now at her husband’s sleeping form, his back turned against her. She dimmed the phone’s brightness to the lowest possible setting. She swiped through various screens but could not retain much of what she saw. Tropical storm, six-foot surge, 150 awaiting rescue. Friend struggling into skinny leather pants in a dressing room. Death toll rising. Waterlogged areas. Urgent closing date upcoming. Dear members of the media—please find attacked the early-preview invitation and other press materials. She stared at the typo. Attacked. She chuckled audibly and took a screenshot. This confrontational language slipped out of people unexpectedly, breaching the surface for oxygen. The other day, a friend wrote to say that she would defiantly be at the café— The restaurant fan on the roof of their building revved to life. The walls shuddered; a coin on their nightstand began vibrating at an irritating frequency. Are you kidding me? her husband said, smothering his own head with a pillow. At this fucking hour. So he hadn’t been asleep. I’m going to throw myself out the window. I swear to fucking God. Ass me! they typed on accident, and the occasional Go tit! never got old. Sometimes, meaning to type Done! with her hands in the wrong home position, she typed Die! instead. She eagerly opened the email with the press materials, but before it could fully load, she suddenly remembered what she had wanted to read. Birds and the Urban Environment: Did you know that the Miracle on the Hudson accident, in which Captain Sully had to perform an emergency landing in the Hudson River, was caused by a bird strike? A bird strike happens when one or many birds collide with a plane. Sometimes birds will be ingested into the jet engine and cause catastrophic engine failure. Another common problem for birds is called fatal light attraction. You might not know this, but the majority of migrating birds travel at night and utilize the moon and stars for navigation. However, these days, migrating at night has become deadly. Light pollution from urban centers can work alongside fog and storms to disorient birds. Imagine being distracted while you’re trying to complete a marathon or an Ironman event! Even worse, birds often crash into reflective windows, perceiving them as a continuation of the sky. This is one reason it will sometimes “rain birds” after a storm. Help us! Have you seen these birds? She’d opened up another article, which mentioned the case of a strange tropical bird, with a flat, “lizard shaped” head, that could not leave Times Square. It was most likely an escaped species from a collector’s menagerie. Otherwise it had blown in from somewhere. Tourists pointed and gawked as it slammed helplessly into glass doors and flapped against the panels of glowing screens. Still up? Hey! Here finally? I’m really looking forward to seeing you. As though on cue, a pink aura—a kind of sparkling rainbow mash—appeared on the borders of her vision. She clicked her screen closed. You don’t find instant connections easily, an elderly man on the bus had once told her, unsolicited. Five or six times in a lifetime, that’s all. The phone glowed again. Will I see you at the gallery tomorrow? Yes, of course. Then nothing. Perhaps he was going through customs, or the reception was weak. She stared at the window expectantly. When the text came through, it was a picture of him with an inflatable travel pillow around his neck. Was a selfie always an invitation for another selfie? Impossible in the dark, here, in bed. She could send a joke in response. Or the screenshot of the gallery’s typo. She opened her sister’s chat window to work out the text draft there, so he wouldn’t see her typing. Who are you talking to? Please. I’m begging you. I have to get to campus early, her husband said. My sister. I’m almost done. We forgot to do the laundry. Tomorrow, okay? She sent her screenshot, clicked off the phone, and shoved it under her pillow. She imagined vibrations against her ear but forced herself not to look. This is a momentary infatuation and it will dissipate soon, she thought. I have nothing to confess. Sweetie, you’re obsessed with being good, her friend had said once, to tease her. Secret feelings aren’t the same as actions. In her daily life, nothing that was felt could be acted upon; what could be acted upon followed routines of inertia or necessity. To be an adult was to feel a thing and walk away from it. To feel anxiety and know its baselessness, to feel jealousy and chalk it up to insecurity. To feel the need to run out of the train, screaming, yet remain completely still, unruffled. Her husband began snoring. She closed her eyes and put her hand into her underwear. Before she fell asleep, she thought about the Mandarin duck that had appeared one day in a pond in Central Park. The duck was dazzling, with high-contrast plumage reminiscent of a Peking-opera mask. Its arrival had felt like a very special occasion, like a visit from a prime minister. Now, according to the articles, the duck paddled around with the common mallards, circling idly for crumbs of bread. Visitors flocked to take its photo. Beautiful things want to be replicated, so philosophers say. Was this visitation beautiful? The unfathomable longing of this wayward bird that wakes one day in a man-made pond, alone among strangers. The woman spent most of the next morning in bed. In the middle of the night, the artist had sent an audio file—no subject, no body, just a recording of himself playing scales on the guitar. Higher, faster, changing keys, breaking off into riffs and climaxes. The file had gone on for 10 minutes. She hadn’t understood his intention, but her gut had kicked so violently that she’d had to take several shits. After she’d listened to the file, she’d dug around online for his past interviews, trying to summon his actual voice. She’d found a short documentary on public television, but the green of his shirt had put her off. Next, she’d scrolled through Google Image search, looking for new pictures, then the tagged photos on his social-media profile, and had found one of him looking at the camera with a dreamy, postcoital expression. She had masturbated to this and now she was late, speed-walking to the gallery. She was sweaty in the unseasonable humidity, and her hair was wilting. She could feel the sting of salt in the fresh wound in the corner of her mouth. Getting ready, she’d picked at a patch of dead skin until it bled. Miriam just picked up the cake! Can’t wait to see you all! She approached the gallery and saw a block of text pasted on the white wall at the entrance. Underneath was his name in big black lettering. APORIA PETER FANG-CAPRA Inside, workers on ladders with buckets of black paint were brushing an enormous contraption of pneumatic valves and tubes and elbows. She saw him up there, craning his neck and pointing a finger along a ribbed piece that linked to a mechanical lung. The artist looked the way she’d remembered … perhaps more diminutive. Her voice was lost in the din. Hey, do you guys need some help? He climbed down from the ladder. Look who’s here, at the very end of the day. She stiffened in his embrace. I thought you would show up earlier. Come. We tried to save some of the work so you could see. Gripping her forearm, he led her underneath some scaffolding, and they stood before a maze of freshly oiled pieces, on a blue tarp, that had yet to be lifted into the sculpture. He gestured toward a metal chamber. An organ? The apparatus seemed to follow the logic of utility, but if one looked closely, the structure had no observable function. Where things ended or began was impossible to say. Head, tail, mouth, or anus. She took out her phone to take photos. We’re here by the bathrooms. Got two tables. Taking all bier and wurst orders! By the way, I’m sorry about that file I sent, he said. Please don’t listen to it. I play scales when I’m nervous, and it helps calm me down. Too late. I listened to the whole thing on repeat when I went for a run this morning. I’m so embarrassed. You’re really good at the guitar. Abruptly, he grabbed her by the shoulders and leaned in, his lips brushing her ear. Don’t turn now. My gallerist is walking rapidly toward us with a very determined expression. Pretend we’re invisible. Oh God, she’s looking for me. She’s quite mad. I’ll have to be right back. She watched as he danced off to intercept a tall, finely dressed woman. They retreated into a back office and closed the door behind them. The woman looked again at her phone. dang you dense girl homeboy turning up the charm so you’ll write a good review that simple heard a thing or two about him be careful kk love Alone, the woman tried to look preoccupied and circled the machine, as though studying its craftmanship. She had long reached the end of her observations. She took out her phone again, scrolled through her email, and opened up the press materials. “Is my death possible?” asks Jacques Derrida in Aporias. How can one experience that which is impossible to experience? In this new sculptural work, Fang-Capra asks whether the future itself is aporetic, a pipe dream or a mirage. Materials of modernity comprise this convoluted structure; discourses of biopolitical and emotional disaster are limned by discarded pipes and sheet metal. What would a machine of the impossible look like? The enfolding tensions of late capitalism are shaped into a coherent yet discomfiting whole. She went outside and walked toward the corner bodega. Once there, she bought a can of seltzer and considered the bodega’s neon display of CBD gummies. An LED sign flashed: HELLO VAPE WORLD MILE HIGH CLUB ITS YOUR YEAR YEAR TO QUIT She bought a pack of regular cigarettes and looked for a socially sanctioned place to smoke. I’m an analog kind of girl too, said a blue-haired woman who was also smoking in the piss-scented alleyway. They exhaled their respective clouds of combustion and pulled their arms more tightly around themselves. She nodded. We evolved around the communal fire; think about that. She didn’t like to inhale too deeply anymore. Hey babe. Ordered u a yummy fleischsalat. She finished her cigarette and went back inside the gallery. Two other writers she recognized had also come to preview the installation. She waved hello and approached them, catching the last fragments of their conversation. Dude must have paid a shit ton to ship all this metal. Wonder how he harvested these car parts. Probably dispatched a crew of interns to a Third World junkyard, then mobilized another crew to receive them in Berlin, where they breathed toxic fumes and shaved off years of their life for vague proximity to art-world fame. That envy talking? I’m feeling a takedown coming. A slammed door. The artist walked out, shouting, Yes, yes, I know. See you at breakfast. Good luck. The two critics congratulated him, patting him amiably. Thank you, thank you, the artist said, shaking his head. All of you are much too kind. Everything okay? She asked. They really need me to get dinner with this Saudi prince. A collector they’re courting. Don’t you have to go? Big payday, no? There are so many princes. Can’t keep track of them all. Hey, you. Aren’t you taking me somewhere? He suddenly prodded her, as though they had been interrupted mid-conversation. Aren’t you taking me out for a drink to talk nuts and bolts and hammered grommets? Her phone lit up in her palm. Cake is about to have a meltdown, lol. When u coming???? Only if now’s a good time for you … No no, she protested, typing fast. Honey don’t wait for me She looked up. Seriously. Do you have somewhere to be? The cab driver turned north onto the West Side Highway. I can’t stand these screens, the artist said, jabbing at the mounted tablet in front of them. What trash. The touch screen was desensitized with a filmy layer of grease, the cumulative tapping of many dirty hands. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. he said, pressing hard. The sound muted, he settled back into his seat and turned toward her. His hands floated up and down his legs. Everyone wants your attention, she said. Royalty, technology. How do you manage? Yes. I do need to get away from it all. He sighed in a melodramatic way. Well, that’s the life of a world-famous artist. Another one of his jokes. She cracked a smile. Don’t I manage to give you my undivided attention? Not really, she said. But I don’t expect it from you. He mimed a punctured heart and smiled that winning smile. It might not appear as such, he said, but I’m an insanely jealous person. I am very aware of this flaw in myself. I don’t like to have any distractions. He pulled her closer. What have you been thinking about? Ever since you arrived, your mind seems elsewhere. He was smiling even more broadly now, and she was smiling, and they were both smiling at each other like two dumb dogs. A wide, shit-eating grin is how someone would have described it. Had her mouth ever stretched this wide. Had she ever felt this turned on. Had anything ever been this real. He licked his lips. She could see a coating of white at the corners of his mouth, the kind of thick saliva that accrues after too many drugs, or too much talking and not enough water. She pulled slightly away but he grabbed her chin and held it fast as he worked his mouth up and down her neck. Eventually he settled on a spot above her collarbone, attaching and sucking, round and full, like a lamprey on aquarium glass. It hurt a bit; her eyes fluttered open. Behind his head, next to the rear window, was a message for her. Where are you? This time, the dangling seat-belt buckle had reflected the blue from the Chelsea Piers sign. Yesterday, I was reading about birds, she wanted to say. That’s what I was doing. Have you ever thought about how a bird is like a kind of machine? One clammy hand was already under her shirt, flicking her nipple through her bra. The other hand crawled up her thigh, a thumb pushing against the nub of her clit. Birds are automatons with a repertoire of preprogrammed behavior. They do everything by instinct. Fly, feed, migrate, mate. An osprey will return to nest in the same place even if it happens to be in the middle of a traffic intersection. A guinea fowl accustomed to flat terrain won’t know to fly over a low mesh fence to get to the other side. It may simply keep running into the barrier, over and over again. You’re ready for this, he moaned. You’re so ready. A bird hardly knows what it’s in love with. A baby cuckoo will push the other baby birds out of the nest, and the parents will keep feeding the parasitic chick. Goslings will bond with whatever moving thing they see in their first minutes of life. I once saw a pigeon guard its nest while its dead mate lay nearby. I’ll be there soon. I’ll be late. I’ll be so late I won’t arrive. Let’s have a drink on the roof at your place, she could say. See the tops of the trees in Central Park. Birds congregate there because there’s little other refuge for miles around, to land, to rest … Don’t wait up for me. Imagine the sheer density in that sliver of green. The driver coughed a few times. She opened her eyes and saw, as they idled at a light, a spectacle of starlings feasting on a fried chicken wing from the garbage. She wanted to look away. Their adaptivity made them repulsive. They could use their intelligence for problem-solving. They could eat anything and live anywhere. They could learn new habits of being. Midtown was fading in the rearview mirror, a cloud of light rising above Times Square. Dots of pink and white, flashing, scintillating. Dizzy with desire, she gazed up at the camera flashes, at the neon tickers. She struggled against the car door, her forehead knocking against glass. He was shoving her out of the cab and through the revolving doors of the hotel. Upstairs, the hotel room was rimmed with glass. She felt the whoosh and boom of being orbited on all sides by a monsoon of light. She approached the window. Isn’t it curious how people always want to be high up and have a bird’s-eye view of things? As if we can’t see what we’re doing down there every single day. Looking down, she thought of a woodcock, with its large, depthless eyes that see better behind than ahead. In her mind’s eye, she saw the patch of field by the schoolyard, where pink-and-white clover grew. Decades ago, she had lost herself in them, pinching stems to string into a necklace. She remembered the green grass, the blue sky, the brown mud, her teacher’s face looming suddenly so close to hers, asking, What do you see? She’d pointed. The iridescent blue of a butterfly’s wing. The woodcock lies quietly on the sidewalk, paralyzed, its neck snapped in two. The heels of commuters click busily around it. But I will learn to adapt, the woman thought. I will be a city bird."

        "year": "2025",
        "story": "April 20: Sometimes feel life stinks, everything bad/getting worse, everyone doomed. Then day like today occurs, reminding one that yes, although life stinks, does not always stink to same extent, i.e., variation can occur in extent to which life, from day to day, may stink. Today strange. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. Strange day at work. Sally Gear = extremely tall co-worker with perpetual explosion of unbrushed gray hair. Nice lady. Many kids: three from previous marriage, four adopted. Plus, usually, one or two foster kids. Also 12 cats, nine dogs, five rescued ferrets, all living on run-down farm outside of town. Is always explaining: reason she looks so bad/ragged = totally swamped with kids/adopted kids/foster kids/pets/farm. Her husband, Sid, also tall, w/ same gray hair-explosion. When together, always laughing, leaning into each other, looking unkempt, happy, bellowing out story re latest wacky thing done by kid, foster kid, ferret, and/or donkey they keep tied to tree. When Sid comes to office to pick Sally up, will say, “So this is how they do it in the big city!” or “Say, this is one heckuva fancy orifice!” (Which is odd: Sid not country, Sid = Wesleyan grad, grew up in Philadelphia, family owned famous shoe store.) This week, one of their foster kids selling candy bars for Swim Team. Sally has put box of candy bars in Break Area, with sign: DON’T BE ALL WET! BUY A CANDY BAR FROM TERRENCE. Liv VanUster annoyed by presence of candy bars, emails Sally: this = place of business. How would Sally like it if she, Liv, brought in ton of magazines, encouraged all to buy magazines, for her Women’s Personal History Group? Sally says sure, no problem, she can just scoot candy bars over. What magazines do they have anyway? Any about ferrets/foster kids/growing organic vegetables in limited space? Liv emails back: no, Sally missing point. Sally being rude, making it impossible for people to decline to buy crappo candy bars, i.e., Sally letting her weird life choices overflow into Break Area. Liv = tough = big complainer. Complains if someone tracks in snow: slip-and-trip hazard. Once complained janitor had given her “predatory glance,” demanded that Ed Finer (our boss) reprimand janitor. Turned out, janitor legally blind. Was not giving predatory glance, was trying to ascertain if thing on Liv’s lapel = spider. Liv apologized to janitor, rushed back to Finer, said that although, yes, she is, of course, #1 advocate for visually impaired, on other hand, why pay blind janitor full salary, since blind janitor likely incapable of getting anything truly clean? Sally hurt by Liv’s email. Replies to entire office. Says her life choices not “weird.” Swim Team “weird”? Having husband “weird”? Having kids “weird”? Having certain modicum of warmth/affection in life “weird”? This raises ante: Liv single, never married, no kids, no current boyfriend. Office tense all morning. Just before lunch, Liv sends Sally email of apology, also to entire office: Sally, I was out of line. It was rude of me to characterize your life as “weird.” Many apologies. Your life actually strikes me as admirable: the kids, the pets, the ferrets. Wow. You do so much for others. Sometimes my own unhappiness will drive me to become overinvolved in things that might easily be overlooked. Please trust that I am working on this. I sincerely apologize. Everyone impressed. This gracious, this surprising, should end whole thing. But no. Within minutes, Sally replies: Nice try, Liv. That is so typical! You get your dig in, then retreat to higher ground? “Your life actually strikes me as admirable.” Ha! I bet. My hubby may be bony and countrified but at least I’ve GOT one. You have the nerve to call my life weird? Then real quick apologize, as if you are all holy? Everyone knows you color your hair! I am sick and tired of your fakeness. You jabbed me and now have got me going. Not going to fly, sister. You wear makeup like clown makeup. Stay out of my way or I don’t know what might happen. This crazy. This not like Sally. Sally kind. Sally sweet. Often so happy in morning, will do jig in Break Room. Will sometimes, for no reason, make brownies at home, bring brownie to desk of each person in office, with person’s initials, in M&Ms, on brownie. Apparently, Liv has hit nerve. Finer calls Sally in. Tells Sally enough = enough: Liv has apologized, is time for Sally to accept Liv’s apology, put this behind us. Sally storms out, sends email in which she says she knows everyone against her, everyone siding with “sneak-thief,” just because “sneak-thief” = wealthier, younger, more attractive. This dubious. Liv possibly wealthier. But younger? No. Sally younger. Liv more attractive? Debatable, Kate G. says, in Break Area. Sally has weird gray hair-explosion, true, but, Kate points out, Liv has prominent jaw + is strangely wide at hip. Finer goes to Sally’s office to talk her down. Sally gone (!). All her stuff gone. Pics of her ferrets gone, special clogging shoes + apron gone, box of Swim Team candy, formerly in Break Area, gone. On Post-it note on Sally’s desk: I QUIT!!! Rest of morning, Liv roams around office like martyred queen, saying she did her best, does not know how else she might have handled, feels she bent over backwards to pull thing out of fire, etc. All confident Sally will be back. Sally/Sid not rich. Kids + foster kids + animals not cheap. Plus, Sid has bad knees, extreme asthma, cannot work outside of home/farm, i.e., no way Sid + Sally can make it without Sally’s paycheck. Have lunch in Finer’s office, with Finer. Jill (my wife, my person, we have been through wars together) texts: How are things @ Moron Factory? (As joke, between selves, we sometimes call my workplace “Moron Factory.” Re my workplace, Jill pities me. Comes to office Christmas party, is bored/annoyed whole time, rolling eyes if anyone talks shop. Her attitude: Sweetie, these people, my God, you are true champ, how do you even bear? Is true: our office odd. No one stable. Everyone nuts in his/her own way. Usually, at work, I keep to self. Don’t socialize. Just do my work, head straight home.) Just then, Paige (receptionist) calls, says Sid calling, for Finer. Finer raises eyebrows at me, puts Sid on speaker: Sid: Ed, are you sitting down? Finer is. Is sitting. Ergo, can honestly say yes, he is sitting. Sid, on speaker: Sally’s gone. Finer: Where’d she go? Sid: She’s dead. Finer freezes. Was about to pick up pen, tap lamp with pen in way he does when bored. But now: no. Hand frozen over pen in shape of hand about to pick up pen, he widens eyes at me, as in: This really happening? Sid: Her poor old heart finally gave out. Because of you people. That gal was such a softie. But you people harried her and condescended to her and insulted her and never gave her the time of day. Finer protests: We did, we did give Sally time of day. We liked Sally, loved Sally. Hopes Sid will recall last August, pool party at Finer’s house, when all sang “Happy Birthday” to Sally as Sally stood blushing at shallow end of pool holding overflowing plate of nachos. Sid breaks down. Seems to drop phone. Can hear him sobbing. Dog barks, truck goes past, donkey brays from out in yard, presumably tied to tree. Finer calls office-wide meeting to announce Sally = dead. Weeping breaks out. Oh, Sally, we feel, you were always just there, passing out your brownies, giving each of us a cheerful word, bringing our copies to us if we had left them on the Minolta, coming in dressed as witch on Halloween when no one else even wearing costume, taking trouble, whenever someone dropped by your office, to quickly don long, warty nose, then cackle. All examining own consciences. What harsh things did we say to Sally over years? What nice things? What jokes did we make behind back of Sally? Well, we feel, cannot just go around all day, assuring every person he or she = valued. Even cavemen, in ancient, simpler times, could not merely sit around in cave admiring/praising one another, but had to hunt, fight, compete with members of own group for status. All feel a bit sick. I go down, sit a moment in Sally’s empty office. Look at own hands. These hands someday dead, bluish, crossed on chest? Cross hands on chest. Think: Sally dead. Just this morning, was right here, alive. Now, no. Just then, someone passes in hallway. Yikes, I think, did he/she see me sitting in chair of recently dead lady, crossing hands over chest like corpse in coffin? Spring to feet. Step briskly into hall. Moving steadily away down hall: Maxine. Maxine turns, gives me wave + sad smile, quality of which indicates she did not, thank God, see me imitating posture of Sally dead in coffin. Dodged bullet there. Life not easy. Life = tightrope. Most days, we stroll along rope, all fine, gazing off at distant hills, making future plans. But down below: those who have fallen. For them, all not fine. No future plans. Glad that not me, we may think. But ultimately, we too will fall. All must. Trouble will find us, shake tightrope, down we too will fall. Today, Sally has fallen, Sid has fallen. We, as office, have fallen. How might we, as office, begin to make amends? Raise money for charity of Sid’s choice? Foster care? American Heart Association? Donkeys who are sick? Donate money directly to Sid, who, no doubt, will need? Go to see Finer. He is in there with someone, door closed. Must wait. Out little window overlooking Parking: our Taurus. Baby rattle on dash. Not our baby’s rattle. We have no baby. Chose not to. Also, could not, as it turned out. Actually, was other way around: wanted, found out could not have, decided did not want. This was years ago. Big drama at time. All fine now. Tershers, friends of ours, came to town last month, left behind rattle of their baby (Marco). Tershers live across state. Could mail rattle. But postage = double price of rattle. Could just throw rattle away. Is cheap rattle. But throwing away rattle sans Tershers’ permission seems weird. But also seems weird to call Tershers, say, Hey, okay to toss your rattle? Tershers may feel: Oh, gosh, right, sad: sight of our rattle must remind them they have no baby. But no. Does not. Or, rather, maybe does, slightly, i.e., every time I get in car, see rattle, I think: Still fine we have no baby? Then assure self: yes, yes, of course, still fine, that ship sailed long ago, are at peace with, we two have great life full of laughs + tenderness. Door flies open, Liv bolts out. Inside, Finer has head down on desk. Says Liv just told him most horrible story: When teen, Liv got in huge fight with dad. That night, dad cut off own leg with chain saw in woods, bled out while attempting to crawl back to house. Dad had owned chain saw for years, never used, did not know how to use, but that night, upset with certain things Liv said during fight re his failings (too passive + wishy-washy), made big manly point of storming decisively out of house into woods, taking chain saw, with which he had zero experience, accidentally applied chain saw to large boulder that he, in dark, believed to be stump. Crawling back to house, bleeding out, wrote note on back of shopping list, only too bad: big storm swept in, rain fell all night, so, by time they found dad dead in morning, his note = too smudged to read. Today, Liv having flashback: feels she once again caused tragic event via reckless speech, i.e., picked fight with Sally, sent Sally over edge, gave Sally heart attack, i.e., “killed” Sally. I suggest we go find Liv, comfort Liv. Finer: Yes, yes, of course, how stupid and thoughtless am I? However, Liv not in her office. Nowhere to be found. Paige (receptionist) says Liv raced past in huff, appearing “muy weirded-out,” briefly paused at door, as if could not recall how to open. Paige rose, opened door, Liv thanked Paige, albeit calling her “Piper.” Leaving work not like Liv. At all. Liv super-responsible. When having appendix out, Liv constantly texting Finer from hospital bed, reminding Finer they had agreed that new coffee maker in Break Room must meet or exceed quality of current coffee maker. Immediately post-surgery, Liv dictated text to nurse, specifying acceptable models, suggesting Finer poll office on desired color. Finer = former military. Saw some things over there. Way we know this is: he never talks about. If someone asks if he saw some things, he will say: No, had quiet tour, mostly did ordering for cafeteria. Then his face will change in way that makes anyone seeing it doubt what Finer has just said re not having seen some things. At moment, Finer = mess. Asks me to send flowers to Sid. On day of service, you mean? I say. Finer says yes, day of service, right, for sure. But also today. We’re sending flowers twice. At least. Two separate sets of flowers. He feels so bad. This happened in office of which he was in charge? What does this say about his leadership style? Not sure he will ever live down, ever feel better about. Wants Sid to know we are thinking of him. Not enough flowers in world, he feels, to make this thing up to Sid. I mention my idea of starting fund for Sid. Finer feels this may be one too many. Does not want to concede liability for Sally’s death. Oh God, he says, listen to me, Mr. Corporate, evading responsibility already. No, yes, that great idea, he says, let’s do fund. Also, let’s get Sid on horn immediately, give direct, heartfelt apology, accept all blame, see if there is anything at all, even smallest thing, we can do for Sid, poor Sid, after which we’ll send first set of flowers, get started on details of fund. Call Sid. Guess who answers? Sally (!). Finer: You’re not dead? Sally: Not that I know of. Long pause. Sally (yelling): Sid, you jamoke! You didn’t! Why would you? I told you no! What a dumb idea, Butch! Sid takes phone, apologizes. Says if we are wondering who Butch is, is him. Sally sometimes will call him Butch. Is pet name. As for death business? Sorry, sorry, bad call. That on him. Loves Sally so much, was going just nutty watching her mope all heartbroken around house feeling undervalued. He did not, perhaps, it would now appear, think thing all the way through. Double-dang-it. Is deeply sorry for any confusion he may have caused, promises he will never do again. Sally, in background: You won’t do it again, Butch? You think? Are you out of your gourd? Damn straight, dingbat! Sally grabs phone, says she is coming in, will be right down. Fifteen minutes later, all dressed up, in suit, hair combed for once, she arrives, goes around from office to office, apologizing on Sid’s behalf. Is strange. No one mad. Sally so dignified. Because all believed her dead, she is now like celeb. Many pull her aside to tell her how dear she is to them, how often, over the years, they have found selves wondering, “What would Sally do?,” how sad it has been today to walk past her office, not be greeted by crumpled-up paper ball rolling into hall which would, when unwrapped, be found to say, “Come on in, you!” or “Work SUX!” Finer glowingly watching Sally accepting hug after hug. Asks me to call Liv at home, tell her good news, i.e., Sally = not dead after all. I dial, put phone on speaker. No answer. Message new. Old message: professional, crisp. Included numbered lists of categories into which caller should place his or her call. New message: “You’ve reached Liv. Who is not available. Ever again. Where I go now, I should have gone long ago.” Yikes, we feel. All have heard rumor re Liv’s recent breakup with nutty spa-supply salesman, Wayne: she did not, in fact, go to Italy to learn to make pasta in authentic way but, rather, in bathroom at Denny’s on Clover, lit several candles, which she had snuck into bathroom in tote, then took many pills, nearly died, was given CPR by special-needs bus girl, recuperated for month at sister’s tiny apartment in Blanket Farm Estates, out near airport. We leave message. Leave two messages, three. Just keep calling. Soon voicemail full. Finer and I fly off through town in my Taurus. Finer gives me glance, as in: Why rattle on dash of guy with no baby? Tosses rattle into glove box, slams glove box closed. Everywhere people moving around, happy to be alive. On Tooley Bridge, under fat white clouds, two friends throw arms around each other, each holding cup of coffee far out from body so as not to spill on other while hugging. In front of hospital, old man talking to equally old woman makes motion of throwing football, does victory shimmy, she shakes head as in: That, my friend = one bad shimmy. Finer says, tensely, that, at end of day, Liv savvy, Liv smart, Liv too egotistical to kill self. Me: Hope so. Him: Oh God. If she does? If she has? Already? That’s the end of me. I mean it. I had a thing happen. When I was serving. Did I ever tell you? Me: No. Him: Later. We arrive at Liv’s. Through front window: lit candles everywhere (on coffee table, atop microwave, all the way up staircase). At kitchen table: Liv, slumping, looking like she is in hell of own making, several bottles of pills spread out before her on table, rifle (!) in lap. What to do? Am afraid to knock on window. May push Liv over edge (?). On other hand, if do not knock, Liv may take pills or suddenly shoot self before we have chance to convey happy news re Sally (i.e., Sally = not dead). Tense moment. Wish I was anywhere else. But Finer bold, Finer hero: knocks sharply on window, shouts: Liv, open up! Liv doesn’t budge. Finer punches out window (!), reaches in, opens window, climbs through. Liv sits frozen, watching him come, as if she wishes to be saved but cannot possibly imagine what might do trick. Finer: Sally’s alive, Sid’s a big a-hole. You did no harm: everything’s fine, all is well. Liv stands slowly, sets rifle on table gently, as if afraid it may go off on own. Finer’s arm, shoulder bleeding from broken window. Liv holds up finger, as in: wait. Walks off, comes back with first-aid kit, has Finer remove shirt, sits on chair before him, tends to his wounds, picking out shards, putting bloody shards on table, applying salve. We drive back to office, Finer in back, Liv in front w/ me, looking out window. All three silent whole time. Odd: everyone gone from streets. Town like empty stage. Purple clouds rolling in. Papers racing along sidewalks in wind, as if rushing home to common apartment complex where all loose pieces of paper required to live. At office, Sally is in Bullpen, telling funny story re their donkey in lively way to small group of rapt admirers. Turns, sees Liv. Am watching Liv’s face. Anger flares up, replaced by look of: No, no, anger must find no home in me, am done with that, it has cost me too much these many years. Sally gestures to Liv: Come, come here, please forgive. Liv hesitates, does awkward stumble toward her, drops head onto Sally’s shoulder. Just then, Sid hobbles in. Has been waiting out in car, per Sally’s orders, he says, for nearly two hours, reading newspaper as instructed, but is tired; is so hot in car, is sweating like pig, has read entire paper three times, knows all news by heart, time to go home. Sid looks even more agitated + flinchy than usual, as if, in addition to expecting to be referred to as hick for his country ways, is also expecting to be called liar, be banned forever from premises. At sight of Sid, all anger flees room. Office, at the moment, if I may say it this way = swollen with mercy. Sid, sensing he has been forgiven by group, lopes across Bullpen in ungainly way, on wobbly long legs, seizes Sally’s hand + Liv’s hand, shakes resulting hand-cluster overhead, as in: Winners, still champions! What does it even mean? Are not winners, are not champs of anything. If anything, are champs of being difficult, goofballs, needy, problematic. I sneak away, call Jill. How to tell her all that has occurred? Decide to wait. Will tell all tonight, at length. For now, just want to hear her voice. Jill: What is up with you? You sound high. Is true, yes, am high, a bit. Tell her I will give her full scoop later. Jill (dryly): Can’t wait. Finer orders pizza, Kate G. puts on music, Paige (receptionist) throws open windows to let crazy pre-rain breeze blow through. In Bullpen, improbably, colleagues begin dancing. Strange to see colleagues dancing in Bullpen space where we normally spread out in-progress reports, store broken printers, leave our bikes, if have biked to work. Colleagues = non-good dancers. All trying, at least. One will catch eye of other, as in: Can you believe we are doing? + Don’t laugh at me, I won’t laugh at you. Pizza guy bursts in, chin on top box of stack, as if chin’s job is to hold big stack steady. So young. Mere child. Red cheeks, yellow pants, purple hair. Shoots room baffled look, as in: What gives? Why you oldsters dancing in socks to quaint old-time music? Why so happy? Do you not know you are wasting lives in dull corporate space? Unlike me, who will soon take world by storm? Feel like saying: Yes, guilty, are happy. Today, lost none of our number. All still here. Will not be here forever. But all here now. Finer calls out from Bullpen: T! T! (I am Thomas. Hence = “T.”) Finer: Dance with us, brother! What is there to do but join?"

        "year": "2025",
        "story": "The dinner was to be at Galina’s apartment, in the East 70s. She had been watching a lot of Visconti and wanted to re-create the salons and dinners of The Innocent, Ludwig, and Death in Venice. For approximately a decade, her husband, Igor, had been dying from a series of treatable cancers in nonessential tissues. “Dying is so boring after a while,” he said. In the spring, his doctors had told them that nothing more could be done and the time had come to transition to hospice care. Galina and Igor were astonished by the surprise they felt at being told that Igor’s dying had turned acute. “It’s just been such a reversal,” Galina said to her friends. It was like Icelandic villages and their volcanoes: You somehow feel betrayed when the lava sweeps down the rock face and takes everything with it. Galina and Igor had then retreated into their favorite films and novels, which was what had made her throw the party that night. One final note of beauty. Caspar arrived late—he’d had trouble getting across town. Protests cut a diagonal through the city, disrupting the trains and traffic. Even as he stepped into the lobby of Galina’s building, he could hear the beat of the choppers circling above, making a net of slashing light over the blocks between Park and Fifth. Galina met him just off the elevator and kissed his cheeks in greeting. “You’re cold,” she said. The apartment was warm with gold light and the murmur of conversation under music. Someone was playing Schubert on the piano. “The weather finally changed,” he said. She squeezed his fingers. Galina had let her hair go gray during the pandemic, and he was not entirely sure it suited her. She had a round but not kind face with mischievous eyes. She wore a gold dress with a modest neck but a sharp slit. “I’m glad you could come.” In the living room, people sat in their evening finery on lovely antique chairs and velvet chaises. Galina left him at the doorway to join Igor, seated on a chaise at the front by the window. Caspar watched the back of his head, sallow under the chemo fuzz. Igor’s shoulders, once broad, were quite skinny now. His oxygen tank sat at his knees like an obedient mastiff. The pianist was young and blond, which made Caspar realize that he hadn’t seen a blond adult man in a long time. He played the Schubert well, in a lovely though condescending way. He wasn’t really trying. Caspar stood at the back of the room and watched him lilt his way through the piece, going through the motions. This sarcastic attitude made the playing uglier as it went on, and in the end, Caspar retracted his previous judgment—it hadn’t been lovely at all. Everyone clapped. Over the heads of the crowd, Caspar’s eyes met the young man’s. Something poisonously sarcastic in his expression made Caspar want to leave. “Well, look who’s finally here!” It was Nina. She had just come from the bathroom. “Traffic,” he said. “Oh yes,” Nina replied, but did not elaborate. She knew about the protests, of course. Her husband was a senior attorney for the city. “How is he?” Caspar asked. Nina looked out over the room at the others gathered, who had turned at her greeting. She smiled at them and said to him, quietly, “Not here. Not now.” She put her arm through Caspar’s and ushered him forward. Nina and Caspar had both been Galina’s students as undergraduates. They had registered for a graduate course on Faulkner, been intimidated at first, then stayed because of Galina. Together, they made diagrams and charts to take apart The Sound and the Fury, and they ate lunches in Washington Square Park while committing lines of Faulkner’s prose to memory to recite for Galina’s lightning-round verbal interrogations. During that strangely warm fall, they became friends and, for just a couple of confused, painful weeks, nearly more than friends. But Caspar, no matter how hard he tried, was incurably gay, and Nina was, unfortunately, not willing to make herself a martyr. It was for the best, Galina told them later. Because they might have married each other and ruined a lifelong friendship. They stopped by the chaise so that Caspar could say hello. Igor’s eyes were cloudy, and his chest rattled with effortful breathing. The cannula pressed against Caspar’s cheek when he bent to kiss him. “Sorry I’m late,” he said. “No one is ever late in New York,” Igor said. He tried to laugh, but his chest seized up and he had to cough violently into his handkerchief. Galina gave him a glass of water. When Igor recovered, a wild, dazed look in his eyes made Caspar feel cold, as if some winged thing were passing over his soul. “You’ve just seen it, haven’t you?” Igor whispered. He gripped Caspar’s wrist. “Seen what, Igor?” “I know you have.” “No, I haven’t seen anything. I promise.” Igor stared at him as Galina tried to pry his grip loose. “He gets like this in the evenings.” She leaned in to say something in Igor’s ear. His expression grew focused and then softened. When Igor released him, Caspar flexed his hand and looked around to find that people were trying politely not to stare in their direction. About 20 guests had arrived, too few to be truly anonymous. Nina came to the front to help Galina with Igor, first getting him to stand and then escorting him out of the room. As they passed, people touched his shoulder and his back. They squeezed his arm and said quiet, comforting things. The three of them and the little tank on its cart reached the doorway and turned the corner. Several guests approached Caspar—Simon and Richard, two of Galina’s former colleagues in the English department, and Elaine, a literary critic. Their smeary glasses turned their eyes large and owl-like as they blinked at him wordlessly, as though the mere act of looking were enough of a prompt. “He didn’t say anything to me, not really,” Caspar said. “It’s just very strange,” Richard said. “I’ve known him a long time. I never thought he’d go batty.” “Has he been saying strange things to you?” Caspar asked. “Yes,” Richard said, “though nothing very interesting. I was sitting with him the other day, had been for an hour or so, just reading to him—Galina was out, but reading calms him when she’s not around. And he just kept … asking for her. Even though he knew she was out for the day.” “But maybe he didn’t know it,” Simon replied. “That’s how it is. They don’t know. They are prisoners of their present. They have no recourse to the past and therefore no recourse to knowledge.” Elaine’s eyes widened, and she made a low hum of disagreement. “Oh, don’t start,” Richard said. Caspar laughed. Elaine’s area of expertise was modernism. “I’m going to make my rounds,” Caspar said. As he left, Elaine was puffing up her chest. After that Faulkner class, he had gone on to study mathematics and physics. Now he was an adjunct, trying to find a postdoc that might lead to a material change in his life. Nothing had been forthcoming. Aside from various former students of Igor’s, no one looked familiar, including the pianist, who now lurked near the window, staring down onto the city. All that anyone else seemed to know was that he was a distant relative of Igor’s, from Prague, and that his name was Radek. He wore a casual suit, slightly boxy, in dark gray, with elegant shoes, and standing there at the window, he was clearly tall, which hadn’t been obvious when he was sitting. “You are the relative,” Caspar said by way of hello. He offered Radek a glass of white wine. Radek refused but smiled. “I am. He is my uncle’s uncle,” he said. Radek had dull-blue eyes, thick brows, and a fullness to his face that might fall away in the coming years. He was younger than Caspar initially thought. “Come to say hello, then?” Radek laughed quietly. “Yes, something like that. It is actually very funny. Two weeks ago, I was walking into rehearsal, and I saw a poster for a talk. And it was strange, because the talk, the series, is named after Igor. And we have the same last name. So I thought, Oh, who is this? I looked it up, thinking, Is this someone from a long time ago? And I found out, no! It is Igor! I call my mom and I say, ‘Mom, Mom, I found this poster! With our name!’ Then she told me that, ‘Aha! That is your uncle’s uncle!’ ” “This is your first time meeting them?” “Yes,” Radek said. “It’s very funny.” Then he grew more contemplative. “I suppose it’s not very funny. It’s very sad.” “Yes,” Caspar said. “He’s a wonderful man.” “Was he your teacher? So many of his students are here.” “No,” Caspar said. “Galina was my teacher. But I have known them for a long time, ever since.” Radek nodded. Then he took the wine from Caspar and gulped it down. “They do seem really wonderful. They must have been great teachers for so many people to have come to say goodbye.” Caspar nodded. It was getting sadder. Outside, over the dark city, the choppers were spreading wide their net of light. Radek turned to watch. “Why are they out there? Do you know? I tried to look it up.” Radek showed him the blank screen of his phone. “There was nothing on the transit apps.” “Protests,” Caspar said. “For what?” Radek frowned. “You don’t remember? This summer, a boy was pushed onto the tracks by a woman. She said that he was attacking her. But it came out that she had just felt unsafe because he was standing near her and talking to himself. He was unhoused. And possibly off his medication. Anyway, they reviewed some footage and the city prosecutor declined to take up the case, and people were very upset.” “Unhoused?” “Homeless,” Caspar said. “Ah.” “He was 17, I think? He’d run away from a group home. Anyway, it was very sad.” “She pushed him because she felt scared?” “Yes,” Caspar said. “And no charges?” “No. And there was a shooting in Brooklyn,” Caspar said. “God, this place.” Caspar laughed. “Yeah, sometimes it really does seem like misfortune piles up here. But I’m not sure the ledger looks any better anywhere else.” “No,” Radek said. “Probably not.” Nina returned, looking tired and pale. Caspar introduced her to Radek. “You’re the nephew,” she said. “Pleasure.” Radek’s eyes glinted as he admired her. He did a silly little bow. “Don’t be patronizing,” she said. “How are they?” Caspar asked. Nina sighed. “I need a cigarette. But they’re fine.” “Should we go down?” “Isn’t it cold?” she asked. “Yes, but since when has that stopped us?” Nina laughed. “Mind if I tag along? I don’t know anyone else,” Radek said. Caspar almost said that he didn’t know the two of them either, but Nina shrugged. “Sure,” she said. They put on their coats and took the elevator down. They stood under the green awning. Radek lit Nina’s cigarette first. Then Caspar lit Radek’s and Nina lit his, a funny game of formality. The chopper blades were audible, but moving into the distance. They could hear the barest whine of sirens and a dull roar from downtown. Nina gazed up the street into the wind, westward. The sharp chill brought tears to her eyes, but she would not look away. “My husband,” she said to Radek, “is a prosecutor for the city. Right now, right this moment in fact, he is holed up in a building somewhere, under siege.” “That’s a bit dramatic,” Caspar said. His fingers were getting numb already. It was mid-November. “No,” she said, flicking ashes to the side. “Not at all. Those were Valeri’s words. Under siege, can’t make it tonight, eye-roll emoji.” “Is he safe?” Radek asked. They both looked at him, his boyish exuberance. His flashing eyes. Nina took a long pull on her cigarette. “Very,” Caspar said. “He’ll be fine.” “This whole case is such a nightmare,” she said. Caspar looked away. They had very nearly gotten into an argument several times because Nina believed the woman’s fear was sufficient cause to defend herself. Caspar did not agree, at least not entirely, that the woman was without blame or culpability. You couldn’t go around in the world weaponizing your fear against other people. Did others not also have an equal claim to safety? They couldn’t come to an agreement. Caspar didn’t want to say that Nina’s judgment was impaired by the fact that she was also a white woman. Nina obviously felt the same way about Caspar being Black. “I feel for the girl,” she said. Caspar suppressed his urge to respond. He walked to the other side of the awning and gazed eastward down the street. “Still,” Radek said. “She did cause a boy to die.” “Boy,” Nina said, but then, catching herself, “I’m just worried about my husband.” “Understandable,” Radek said. Caspar watched a Lyft pull to a stop and let passengers out across the street. Two drunk women, their voices high and brittle, laughed as they helped each other into the lobby of their building. The car pulled away. Caspar looked up at Galina’s building. The doorman stood at the ready to let them back inside. Nina and Radek were whispering about something. Nina had a bad habit of collecting strays. Caspar dropped his cigarette and put it out with his heel. “Should we go back up?” Radek was laughing, looking in Caspar’s direction. Nina smiled. “Of course, my love.” She took Caspar’s arm. “Your coat will smell like smoke. Aren’t you supposed to be quitting?” “I’ll just blame your bad influence,” she said. Radek lagged behind as they went inside. Nina glanced back at him and murmured, “What do you make of our new puppy?” Caspar pressed the call button for the elevator. Radek stood awkwardly off to the side. He was good-looking, though Caspar couldn’t get rid of the impression from earlier, the sarcastic Schubert. “I think he’s a child,” he said. “That’s the problem with New York,” Nina pouted. “There are no men anymore.” “Were there ever?” he asked. “Oh yes,” she said, loud enough for Radek to hear. “But now they’re all eunuchs.” Back in the apartment, they hung their coats in the closet. Galina had returned from the bedroom and was standing just outside the kitchen. The other guests had gone to sit in the dining room. Nina made Radek pour her another glass of wine. Caspar joined Galina. “Smoking? How bad,” she said. “Where is Nina?” “With your nephew,” he said. Galina turned her head just slightly so that she could take in the sight of Nina and Radek. Her expression conveyed something that Caspar could not read, but he assumed it was a form of displeasure. “None of my business,” he said. “Awful.” But Galina was now smiling with barely contained amusement. “Shall we go in?” Galina asked. “Nina, you sit with me.” “Of course,” Nina said. “I wouldn’t dream of anything else.” Radek sat on Caspar’s right. They were pretty far down the table from Galina. She and Nina were in close conversation. Galina had hired caterers for the evening, who were setting out the cold soup course. Voices rose and fell. Ben the surgeon was talking to Ben the poet about something Caspar couldn’t quite make out. Someone said, “The pandemic has changed everything—what does and doesn’t make sense, on the money side. It’s all a mess.” Caspar could tell that Radek was following bits and pieces of conversation but not really committing to anything in particular. He seemed content with just being at the table. “Your Schubert earlier was good,” Caspar said. “You thought so?” “But it was not very nice.” “So you could tell,” he said. “I wasn’t supposed to play. I was asked last minute.” “Yes, I thought it was sarcastic,” Caspar said. “A little mean-spirited.” Radek nodded, though he did not look chastened. “Sometimes, I can’t help myself. I have a bad nature—I’m rather spiteful.” “I can tell.” “But is it so bad, to be spiteful?” “Yes,” Caspar said, but then, thinking for a moment, “Maybe not. I don’t know. But tonight it seemed bad.” “Why? I don’t know anyone here.” “But the occasion,” he said. “You had to know that at least. And so, to choose to play a sarcastic Schubert?” “Yes, but didn’t you see Igor’s face?” “No, not at first,” Caspar said. Radek leaned toward him. His breath was sweet from the wine, warm. “He loved it,” Radek said. “I think it made him happy.” Radek’s lips brushed Caspar’s neck, and there was a flash of damp heat. “Well, you’re the one who had the view of his face—I defer to you,” Caspar said. “But you didn’t care for it,” Radek said, and paused. “Don’t you think it’s rather sarcastic to ask someone to play Schubert for a dying man?” Caspar laughed. “You’ve got me there.” They were quiet for a moment. Nina was watching them. “What would you have played if you’d had your pick?” Caspar asked. “For myself or for Igor?” “I hadn’t thought of that,” Caspar said. “What would you have picked for yourself?” “And just piano, or any music?” “Let’s start with just piano.” Radek folded his arms across his chest and hummed in thought. “On a night like this,” he said, turning it over. The fish course had arrived, and Caspar picked at his dorado. A gorgeous, delicate seared white skin. A pale sauce. “Brahms,” Radek said. “His three intermezzi, opus 117.” “I don’t know them,” Caspar said. “He told a friend as he was writing them that they were a lullaby for his grief,” Radek said. “I find them very beautiful. No one really thinks of them. They are overshadowed by opus 118. But Glenn Gould did a recording of opus 117 and it is my favorite of all of his work.” “That’s nice,” Caspar said. “I’ll have to listen to it sometime.” “But listen to the Gould version first. Before you listen to anyone else. His is the best. It’s melancholy, yes, maybe even sad sometimes, but I find it very beautiful and oddly hopeful. Like, Life, it goes on. He understands it the deepest. Everyone else just follows.” “I will,” Caspar said. Radek put his arm around Caspar’s shoulders and squeezed him. The suddenness of the contact, the immediacy, was startling, but also, it had been a long time since someone had truly hugged him. “It’s a promise,” Radek said. “You have to email me or call me when you listen.” Radek’s eyes were very serious. Caspar nodded. “I promise,” he said. Two weeks later, Caspar was walking with Nina in Central Park. Igor had died at the house upstate, near Hudson. There had been no funeral. There had been no memorial. He would not have wanted them to stand around sniffling and crying over him, Galina said. Caspar agreed. The wind was sharp and damp. It was a miserable day for a walk. “How is Valeri?” he asked. “Better,” she said. “Good. I’m glad it worked out.” “Me too,” she sighed. “It was so hard on him. Hard on all of us. Just a sad mistake.” Caspar did not reply right away. “I know you don’t agree,” she said. “But I really do feel sorry for her. And for the man who died, obviously.” “Yes, of course,” he said. “We all feel sorry.” “And poor Igor, too.” They sat on a bench and watched children climb and play. They drank coffee from a cart and talked about what they had been doing for the past two weeks. Nina was in the midst of writing a very long article about a recently rediscovered Italian author whose work had Marxist undertones. “She’s like an Italian Grace Paley,” she said. “But totally sick in the head. Like, deranged body horror. Headless dogs. It’s great.” “I’ll look for it. Where will it be?” “The London Review of Books, if I can meet my deadline,” she said. “What about you? What are you doing? Still wasting yourself on undergraduates?” “I help run a lecture course for a couple of faculty, do some tutoring,” he said. “It’s a life.” “Sounds terrible.” “It’s not,” he said. “Don’t be elitist.” “You should be at MIT,” she said. “No, I shouldn’t. I probably should have just gone into industry.” Nina looked horrified. “You should write. You’re a beautiful writer.” Caspar laughed. “No, that was always you.” “You are. Galina always said so. Your writing is beautiful, sensitive. You are a prime noticer.” “But all the rejection,” he said. “All the bad ideas before you get a good idea. I don’t have the courage.” A group of screaming children threw themselves around in fits of delight and rage. A group of them ran from one end of the playground to another, and they went on that way, until the group grew long and stringy and folded back on itself. All the children, made chubby by their coats and jackets, their hats and scarves, the pitch of their glee rising and falling like a siren. “Have you heard much from Galina?” “She’s still upstate,” Nina said. “That’s all I know. You?” “About the same.” “I hope she’s okay.” “Have you spoken to the nephew?” he asked. Nina flushed and looked down. “No,” she said. “Not a lot.” “Which is it—no or not a lot?” “Don’t be a morality cop,” she said. “It’s nothing.” “Why do I not feel like it’s nothing?” Nina poured the rest of her coffee onto the brown, scraggly lawn. It steamed. “I’ll take that as a sign to shut up,” he said. “Next time, it’s your lap.” They walked back to Columbus Circle. Everything was crusted in Christmas cheer, but neither of them felt very cheerful. “You have a bad habit,” he said. “I know,” she said. She was going uptown. He was going downtown. They parted and took different trains. On the platform, vendors were selling mango and churros and boxes of candy. A man was playing Celine Dion’s greatest power ballads on an electric violin. Caspar stood among the throng waiting for the first compartment on a downtown C. When the train arrived, he read while standing, letting an old woman take the seat he wanted. In between stations, when their train came close to another, he looked into the adjacent car and watched the people there as they, too, went length by length through the dark. In February, Caspar was browsing cards at a downtown stationery store when he heard his name from an unfamiliar voice. He looked up and there was Radek. They had not seen each other since Galina’s party. But as sometimes happened in the city, meeting just the one time charged both people with the potential of meeting again. They hugged, and Radek asked what had brought Caspar to this particular store. “Oh, I live around here,” he said. “No, you can’t.” “Why can’t I?” he asked. “Because I live around here.” “Since when?” “Since two years ago,” Radek said. “I’ve never seen you!” “You wouldn’t have known if you had seen me. You didn’t know me then.” “I guess that’s true,” Caspar said. “I bet I know who that’s for,” Radek said. He pointed to the card in Caspar’s hand, a delicately made watercolor on high-quality stock. Amid softly blooming whorls of earth-toned color was a gorgeous calligraphic rendering of Congratulations! “I bet you do,” he said. Nina had told him three weeks ago about her pregnancy. Valeri was thrilled, but anxious. “You’ve got one too.” Radek had picked out a bright-orange card with happy cats on it, painted in muted watercolor. His eyes darkened just a little. They paid for their cards and stepped out into the cold. Radek asked if he wanted to go to a café. It turned out they had the same favorite spot, near the IFC theater. “I was just here a couple days ago,” Caspar said. “I saw a documentary about Nan Goldin.” “No,” Radek said. “Because I was here a couple nights ago seeing a documentary about Nan Goldin.” They each took out the tickets they’d left in their coat pockets and discovered that they had indeed gone to the same showing. “What did you think?” Radek asked. “I found it very moving,” he said. “A little scattered, but very moving.” Radek ordered an espresso. Caspar ordered a black coffee. The café was busy, so they squeezed in at the bar by the window, sitting on two rickety stools. They talked about the documentary. Radek also found it moving. But less so than Caspar. “It felt like two movies somehow brought together—it also seemed rather dubious on the start of the addiction,” Radek said. “I suppose,” Caspar agreed. “But it’s slippery, with addiction. There’s no definitive hard start. It comes on slowly sometimes.” “But there was a hard start. When that man beat her up and left her. She got deep into heroin. It feels very clear when there’s someone else to blame, but for her own accountability, I don’t know. And the activism stuff, forget it.” “You didn’t like that part?” “I thought it was so boring. So mushy. So good.” “That’s true,” Caspar said. “That part had less scrutiny in it.” “But I did like the part about New York. That era. That would be fun to do again.” “That part really flattened me,” Caspar said. “They were so young and so free. They were broke, yeah, and struggling in a lot of ways, but they seemed so … I don’t know, it’s like they had a different kind of freedom than we have now. A freedom from language for that sort of stuff.” “You mean being gay?” “Yeah, or trans even. It’s like, they all had this space to just exist. I bet that was nice.” Radek hummed in agreement. Neither of them said anything for a few moments. Then he said, “I guess you know.” “That could mean anything,” Caspar said. “What do I know?” “About me and Nina,” he said. “After the party, we met a couple of times. But she told me I wasn’t serious.” “That sounds like her,” Caspar said. Radek had begun turning his cup slowly, and it scraped the fake marble of the tabletop. “It was dumb,” he said. “Yes,” Caspar agreed. Radek looked at him from the side, an appraising stare. “You don’t think I’m bad? You won’t judge me?” “No,” Caspar said. “I was in love with Nina once.” Radek gaped at him. Caspar laughed. “A long time ago—when we were almost young enough to do something stupid about it. But thankfully, Galina stopped us.” “How did she stop you?” “Well, she just let us see that making ourselves unhappy because we thought it would make the other person happier was actually a deeply stupid choice to make.” “Is that why you’re so devoted to her?” Were they devoted to Galina? Caspar wasn’t sure. He hadn’t spoken with her in months. This in itself was not unusual; they sometimes went a whole year without speaking. But yes, he would do almost anything for Galina. “I suppose when someone prevents you from making the greatest mistake of your life, you feel a little loyalty to them.” “Just a little? Americans are so brutal.” “We keep score like no one else,” Caspar said. Radek had stopped turning his cup. The crema had settled in the bottom amid the sooty remnants of the coffee. “Still,” Caspar said. “She must have liked you if she invited you to her baby shower.” Radek showed a confused expression until it clicked. “Oh, Nina. Yes.” They were quiet a bit longer. “And how are you keeping busy?” Caspar asked. “I played a concert,” he said. “A very small one—in a friend’s father’s loft. Me and three others. There is so much money in this place.” “What did you play?” “I played some Philip Glass, actually. I’ve not played a lot of his work. But the show was meant to be a medley of contemporary masters. And I got Glass.” “I love Glass,” Caspar said. “Yeah, people do.” Radek’s eyes flashed. “Don’t be condescending.” “Yeah, yeah,” Radek said. “It was nice. People enjoyed it.” Their time had come to an end. Caspar finished his coffee, and they went back out onto the sidewalk. They hugged goodbye, and as Radek was turning to leave, he stopped. “Did you ever listen to that Brahms?” Caspar paused a moment, searching his memory, and then, alighting upon the relevant facts, he said, “Ah. No, I never did.” “Just as well. I realized I didn’t give you my number, so you couldn’t tell me what you thought.” “Here, give me your phone,” Caspar said. He typed his name and number into Radek’s phone and then called himself. Then he saved Radek’s information. “Now we are in touch.” Radek laughed. They hugged again. Though they lived in the same neighborhood, they lived in opposite directions from the IFC, so they each set off into the cold wind. When Caspar got home, he looked up the Glenn Gould album of the Brahms intermezzi. His music app was a mess of Fauré and Debussy from having let it run long into the night the previous evening, when he’d been grading. Not having enough pop divas of any era in his queue made him feel older than he was. The Gould version of the intermezzi, particularly the three from opus 117, did have what Radek had described. A certain unpretentious lightness, a stirring belief— hope, even. When the melancholy came in the middle of the first intermezzo, it was as if someone had drawn a cool, dark shade across a sunny afternoon. The music changed after that, still progressing, but somehow inflected with a new sadness, so that in its steady forward motion, it became a perfect expression of seeking happiness in dire straits. Caspar could understand why a person would choose this for their last party. The second intermezzo had the underlying character of a waltz, both less wistful and more playful than the first. There were brassier accents as well, and the melody felt more intricate. Yet, here, too, was a theme of nostalgia and recollection, a long backward glance. Caspar played the whole album as he reheated soup for dinner. When it ended, he started it over and sat on his sofa to listen again. Then he wrote Radek a long text message explaining his feelings about the music. But he deleted that. Instead he texted, Listened. Very good. Love the second one especially. Radek texted back, Gould? Yes, Caspar texted. !!! he is the best! I agree. Next time, I will play it for you. Here Caspar paused. The insinuation of a next time. Caspar typed Like you did for Nina? But this seemed needlessly cruel. Instead he sent, Yeah, yeah, sure. No, really, I will. Ok. I will. Come over right now. I will play. Caspar did not know what to say. He felt bad that he had accidentally gotten them on this course of proving something. Or needing to prove something. Then it occurred to him that Radek was being sarcastic again, and that this needling, bratty behavior was somehow part of the charm that had gotten Nina to sleep with him. No, next time is fine, Caspar texted. Radek sent an annoyed emoji. In the spring, Galina had another party. She was selling the apartment and wanted to have a salon to celebrate. Or to close an era. She was in a long black skirt and a gray cashmere sweater. Her face had become keen and smooth. Something had been blasted away from her. She kissed Caspar in greeting and took his arm. The salon was in the afternoon this time. The room was flushed gold with sunlight. Radek and Nina were speaking near the window. Her belly was big now. She wore a gray jersey-knit dress. She looked radiant. Elaine and Richard and Simon were there. The others were not. In honor of Nina’s pregnancy, they were all drinking cider and coffee, tea. There had been a warm soup course and a chicory and fennel salad. The food was good, tart, enlivening. Elaine and Simon were arguing about Woolf and Forster. Elaine thought Forster was a misogynist, and Simon thought Woolf was a homophobe. Richard stood between them looking beleaguered. Galina and Caspar sat on the chaise overlooking the city. Where she and Igor had sat many months ago. “I have been thinking,” she said, “of what he said to you that night.” Caspar had forgotten that moment, but it made itself available to him at this mention. Igor’s wide eyes. The desperation in his grip. “What did you see?” she asked. A long segment of light fell over her lap. They were warm there, the sun striking their knees and thighs. The fabric of the chaise had slowly faded from this light. Every day, soaked in sunshine. “I don’t know,” he said. “Except, that moment, when he choked. I thought I … It wasn’t sight. But I had this feeling of, I don’t know. Like something was going.” Galina nodded. “And I guess he saw me see that? I don’t know. It makes me sad that he got scared because I panicked when he choked.” “His last weeks were very difficult,” she said. “We knew they would be, of course, but to live them? That was excruciating.” Caspar didn’t know what to say. Instead, he put his arm around Galina and let her rest her head on his shoulder. She closed her eyes. Nina sat on the arm of the chaise. She smelled like Radek’s cologne. Radek sat at the piano. He and Caspar shared a look. Then Radek began to play the second intermezzo. The others joined them near the chaise, and Radek played on. Caspar’s chest felt tight. The last notes hung in the air, and then that was it. That was it. Caspar and Radek took the train together. They sat on facing benches. Sometimes, people stood between them and they couldn’t see each other except when the train rocked and opened a space. Radek’s face did not change during the whole ride. He looked as peaceful as when he’d been playing the Brahms. At their stop, they climbed the steps, Radek in front, Caspar behind, and when they emerged, there was a moment when they might have gone in either direction, apart or together. But Caspar did not feel equal to that. They went on standing near the top of the subway-station stairs, which was the worst place to stand. And after a few moments of getting annoyed looks, Radek nodded. Then he put his arm through Caspar’s and led him to the café, where they sat for an hour, not really speaking, not really doing anything, just passing the time together, until the light was gone, and they had to go home."

        "story": "The children don’t look real. It’s because of what they’re wearing—it’s the color of their clothes. None of the T-shirts has any language or images—no slogans or athletes’ names, no animals or action figures. Color conveying only the idea of color. Later, she can’t remember what she noticed except that the colors were very bright. That and the fact that she didn’t recognize any of the children’s faces, though this is the playground of her own child’s school. The children seem to be arranged in groups of three or four. They aren’t moving. Well, they move—some have rubber balls that they hold out to other nearby children and then retract. But they stay in position, as if stuck to a mark on the blacktop. They make no sound. They’re waiting. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. Today is the beginning of her child’s spring break. Otherwise he’d be here now, playing on the blacktop himself, in the jersey that he insists on wearing whenever it’s not in the wash. It was white once, but now it’s a pale gray-brown, a sort of kneecap color. He’s wearing the shirt at the gym where she booked him for a day of ninja/parkour camp so she could go to work. She and her husband had thought about taking a vacation somewhere, but it’s not convenient for him to do that right now, and they can’t afford a trip anyway. She doesn’t mind; she likes being home in the neighborhood, where everything is familiar. Hurrying down the block, she starts to forget about the unreal children. The colors were probably only ordinary pinks and yellows, the children, after all, only ordinary children, the kind who pass from the mind as soon as they pass out of sight. But then she notices the Zamboni. It’s the size of a small dump truck, and the word ZAMBONI is written on the front. She can think of no possible explanation for what it’s doing here. Then she sees a tent with water bottles and snacks. Oh cool, she thinks, a movie. When she picks up her son that afternoon, she tells him that they should go by the school, there’s something happening, but she won’t say what; it’s a surprise. The children have disappeared, but the street is packed with trailers. Young people are everywhere, carrying lengths of metal, black boxes with knobs on them, clipboards, garment bags. They must have just finished shooting. The Zamboni has moved to the other end of the block. It has done what it came to do: It has driven through a dining shed. All along one side of the street are splintered pieces of wood. Chairs have been crushed, tables knocked sideways. White plates have frisbeed and shattered into white pieces. There was no dining shed here that morning; the crew must have constructed and then demolished it in a matter of hours. One corner of the structure still stands, just solid enough to signify what it is meant to be. Does this mean we won’t have to go back to school? her child asks. I’m sure they’ll be done by the time spring break is over. Can I be in the movie? Maybe, she says, which is what she tells him when she knows something is impossible but it’s not her fault. She tries to get him to stand in the middle of the shed and pretend that he’s the one who knocked it down so she can take a picture. Look like the Hulk, she tells him, and flexes her arms. He won’t do it. He won’t even step off the sidewalk. Come on, she says, we’ll send it to Daddy. She mimes a ninja kick in the direction of a table. But he backs away from her. He’s worried they’ll get in trouble. She wants to say that this is their school, their street, that the movie people are only borrowing it. She thinks how much better most things would be if he would just do what she says. Now one of the movie men approaches, fat extension cords coiled around both arms. He’s going to ask them to keep moving, please. She pretends not to see him. Okay, she says to the child, let’s go. That was a Zamboni, she says. It smooths the ice at a skating rink. How? It melts it. It melts the ice? Just the top layer. The ice gets scratched by all the skates. You have to melt it to make the ice smooth again. She skated often as a child but can barely remember what it felt like anymore. She’s never taken her son skating. It seems like too much effort. But he’s her child. How could anything be too much effort? There’s a restaurant on the corner, and it’s funny to notice that just past the last bit of rubble from the movie dining shed is an actual dining shed. Her child stops. The movie chairs are pale wood. The restaurant chairs are white metal. But right between them is one table, set for dinner with plates and silverware and two clear glasses, with two chairs painted blue. Is this one real? her child asks. I think so, she says. Or no. She can’t tell. The restaurant doesn’t open for another 10 minutes. She can see the waiters at the bar. They’re finishing their own meal in what looks like silence; each one has a white apron folded over the back of his chair. She and the child could stay and watch—see if anyone comes to the door, asks to sit outside, is guided to the blue chairs. But even then, how would they know for sure if the people were ordinary diners? They could be movie people testing out the props. They could be rehearsing. Even better, she and her son could have dinner here and request the table themselves. If they were given the blue chairs, they would know that the table was real, because they themselves were certainly real. But her husband won’t like that. He’s planning to cook tonight; he’s going to be home early. She says they should come back tomorrow—tomorrow they can see if it’s still there. In the morning, one of the moms at school has posted an article about the movie on Instagram. A famous actor is starring in it, and it’s not a children’s movie, as she’d assumed—because of the Zamboni and the color of the children’s clothes, or because of the children themselves. The article names the director, who is known for black comedies and the discomfiting avant-garde, and it includes photos of the famous actor in his previous roles. But no other details have been released; the article says nothing of plot. She taps to the woman’s next post, which is about the new war: a cute photo of her daughter eating a doughnut and the words Another thousand murdered children. Imagine if yours was one of them. Spring break seems to go on and on; she can’t wait for it to be over. The school gives a shape to her days. She sees the same people at the same time. The supers sorting the trash. The man carrying boxes of pastries into the coffee shop—there goes the baker with his tray like always. The dog people exchanging their phone numbers. The joggers passing the speed-walking Orthodox. The families like hers, iteration after iteration. When this routine and all its regulars are gone, she feels vaguely afraid, as if her child has only her and his father to depend on. When she sees other parents in the neighborhood now, all they talk about is the movie. I saw the branches first, one of her friends says. What does she mean, the branches? Didn’t you see? Fake budding branches clamped in the trees, like garlands, filling out the gaps. They must have needed it to be later in the spring. Another friend has noticed the sod. The scuffed-up stretch behind the blacktop is lush with new grass. Someone asked the crew if they would leave the grass when they were done, but they said no—they had to roll it back up again. The fake branches, of course, will come down. Perhaps they’re already gone, she’s not sure. Each time she walks by, she forgets to look closely at the trees. Each time she forgets to look for the blue chairs. Today her child is on a playdate. Her husband thinks she overschedules him. Why can’t she just let him play at home? But she likes to see other parents, she likes to see where they live. It makes her feel part of things, as if life is holding on to her with many small buckles and clasps. Besides, it’s impossible to get enough work done when her child is home; he has so many things he wants to say to her—mostly, that he’s bored. Her husband has agreed to get their son in a few hours, so she’s free to go into the office; she can catch up on everything she’s been putting off. But she can’t seem to move toward the train. She always goes straight from the school to the station, always at the same time. This late in the morning, without the steady flow of people bearing her along, she finds that she just can’t do it. She decides to take her laptop to a coffee shop instead. On the way, she walks by the school. She’s so used to the film crew now that she almost misses him—the star of the movie himself—sitting on the front steps. The actor doesn’t look anything like an ordinary person; immediately he looks like a celebrity. He is obviously more beautiful than a normal person. But looking at him, she sees many images of him at once, all the movies and gossip stories and fragrance campaigns. She knows, vaguely, that he played heartthrobs, then bad boys, and has aged lately into serious art. He might be 50, but it’s hard to tell; the record of all his faces works on his face, on what she can see of it now. It’s a bit like looking at her husband and son—otherwise ordinary people she can see only through a sheaf of her own precious impressions. Then she sees that the actor is wearing an orthopedic boot on his right foot. The boot brings her back to reality. Probably it would be rude to mention it. Hi! she says. My kid goes here. I just wanted to say we’re all so excited about the movie. Thank you so much, the actor says. You must be almost done, right? No, no, far from. I just mean because spring break is ending. Oh right. Done at the school. Yes, don’t worry, we’ll be out of your hair soon. Not at all, we’ve loved having you. Why is she speaking like some kind of representative for the community? She’s not even on the PTA. Walking away, she notices that she’s not embarrassed by how awkward the interaction was. She understands that the actor is a real person, but—barely. She could have said anything and it wouldn’t have mattered. A few hours later, she’s deep in a document when her husband calls. Is she still in the neighborhood? Would it be terrible to ask if she could? A client, a meeting, he owes her. She’ll have to pick up her son after all. How was the playdate? she asks him. Fun. What did you do? We played. What did you play? World Cup. What’s that? She’s boring her child, but she persists. It’s her job to teach him manners. I ask this, and you say that, and here you go, thank you very much—like something passed back and forth, the point being less the thing itself than the transaction of attention, the agreement that you both exist, saying I and you and placing the right amount but not too much into the other person’s hands. It’s soccer but inside, and each time someone misses a goal you have to— Unfortunately, as soon as he’s talking, she realizes she’s forgotten to listen. Sounds super fun, she says. She wants to pay attention, but it’s hard. Sometimes she has to force her son to talk, but other times he talks just to make her listen. Can I tell you something? he’ll ask. And after she says yes, she realizes there was nothing he had to tell her. He just wanted her to turn her face to him. She can see him working to come up with something to say. All children do this, of course; sometimes her husband does it too. Can I tell you something? She waits. Did you know volcanoes still exist? People say he looks like his father, and that makes her jealous. It’s not that she wishes he had a small version of her face; she just wants it to be obvious that they belong together. She doesn’t think he looks like anyone, really; not his father, not even himself. His face is always changing, always disorienting her. She recognizes most of all his knees, his shoulders, the circle of his belly. The actor is right where she left him. He’s leaning back on the steps, one leg bent and the other stretched flat. That’s him, she tells her son from a discreet distance. He’s the star. When they reach him, her son immediately asks: What’s on your foot? A boot. It looks like a spaceman’s boot. Thank you, that makes it sound cooler than it is. The actor squints in the sunlight; you wouldn’t think he could make that face. I hear you go to school here. How do you know? I know your mom. I’m in first grade. Super. The actor looks like he’s been polite twice to this local fan and now he wants the conversation to be over. All of us have been wondering what the movie is about, she says. We’re not supposed to say. Just the briefest summary. There’s an NDA. What if I promise not to tell anyone else? It’s not really appropriate for kids, he says. She tells him not to worry, it’ll go over her son’s head. My character is a teacher at the school who’s lost his wife. When I come back to work, everyone is really nice to me. My colleagues give me long hugs in the lounge. But almost right away, everyone moves on. The bell rings every 45 minutes. First period, second period, like a ladder through the day. But this can’t be real, I keep thinking. I would do anything to bring her back. Then one day the children in my class begin to change. At first you think I’m imagining it, that they’re little flashbacks maybe. But I’m not imagining it. My wife used to sing this old song when she thought I wasn’t listening. She’ll be coming ’round the mountain when she comes. She’ll be driving six white horses when she comes. I thought it was something she’d sing to our own children, when we finally chose to have them. I had this image of her holding and rocking and singing some child that song. One day I’m walking down the hallway behind a girl and I hear her. She’s humming. Then she sings: Oh we’ll all go out to meet her when she comes. Oh we’ll all go out to meet her when she comes. Oh we’ll all go out to meet her, we’ll all go out to meet her, we’ll all go out to meet her when she comes. Close-up. Tears in my eyes. In class, I notice a boy is sitting just like my wife did. She had this way of perching on a chair, her knees pulled up against her chest. It looked like something you’d do by a fire, in the grasslands, not at the kitchen table—like how prehistoric people would have sat in case a predator came. It bugged me. Couldn’t she just sit comfortably? Parents start coming in to tell me they’re worried. Their child isn’t sleeping. My wife had terrible insomnia. She rarely drifted off before 1 or 2. At school, the children look exhausted, poor guys. We’ve stopped doing the coursework by this point. I let them nap in class. Sometimes at night my wife would get frightened and I would need to comfort her. I would stand by the bed and rub her back until she fell asleep. I don’t know how much it helped—it wasn’t enough, in the end, to stop her from doing what she did. I never wanted to see her in pain, but those were good moments, when I was attending to her fear. She got me thinking that maybe there really was something bad out there, and she needed my protection. Or maybe the feeling was that nothing was out there, and we were the only ones, and I liked that too. When the children get the same frightened look, I start doing it in class. I have them put their heads down on their desks and I turn off the lights and I walk down each row, humming about her coming ’round the mountain and giving them each a little pat between the shoulder blades. I can see that they’re suffering in the same way she suffered. Worse, because they don’t know what’s happening, why they’re being made to do and feel these things. I feel pretty guilty about it, but I can’t stop. First period, second period, the sound of the bell muffled as if by my own hand. Shh, I think, don’t disturb them. It’s like the classroom is very small and down somewhere very low, and the light comes through a distant hole. They can do that with the camera. By the end, actual events start replicating, here inside the school. I’ll just tell you one. She was a competitive ice-skater as a kid. One day the water freezes in the water fountains. The pipes burst overnight, flooding the halls, and by the time the children come in the next morning, smooth black ice covers the floor from the nurse’s office to the auditorium. She stopped skating when she was 14 or 15, because she fell and broke her leg. So I slip in the hallway and break my leg. She had to miss a recital as a result. It was her first big disappointment, the first thing that was taken from her. She had to sit and watch her friends perform in their bright costumes, and then in came the Zamboni, oozing like a great mechanized slug over all traces of choreography, telling her it was over, she had missed her chance. But worst are the children, too many for one man to rock and sing to, their drooping heads, their soft faces on which I’m stamping this record of experience, and all of them looking up at me, knowing how I wasted her time. The funny thing is that, though I seem to have this power to force the children to embody her, I had no power over my wife herself. I could never make her do what I wanted, what I thought was good for her. By the end, she only laughed at me, when she laughed at all. Eventually I begin to wonder if it’s me who’s in charge, or her, because as much as I think I made this happen, I have no idea how to stop it. I go sit in the back of the classroom and look at the blackboard, hoping that something, anything, will be written there. And: credits. That’s a bad story, says her son. That’s not polite, she says. I told you it wasn’t for kids, the actor says. But it’ll be beautifully shot. From across the street come a woman and two children. They’re selling candy. The brother and sister are in front, each bearing their own cardboard box, each brand of candy in a tidy row. They stop in front of the actor. They must have no idea he’s a celebrity; they think he’s just sitting there. Chocolate? they say. The actor pats his pockets, but he’s not carrying anything. Tom! He calls over a man on the crew, his assistant maybe, who gives each child some cash. The man waves off the candy. Watching the family go, she explains to the actor and his assistant that there’s a new shelter in the neighborhood for migrants. It’s one of the reasons her husband has started talking about leaving the city; he says he doesn’t want their son to have to see so much sadness, though she suspects that what their son sees is mainly kids with candy. The other boy is wearing a jersey from the same team as her son, and socks with flip-flops so small for him, most of his heel is flat on the ground. She wonders what these children see when they look at the school. The shelter must be zoned for a different district because, as far as she knows, none of the residents goes here. Perhaps this place always looks like a film set to them. Those kids should be in school, the assistant says. It’s spring break, she reminds him. Still, terrible to see them being used that way. I don’t know, the actor says. What are they supposed to do? It’s not like they can afford nannies. What would you prefer, the actor asks, for the parents to make them walk behind? She thinks they both have a point: The children raise the stakes of the story. It would be dumb not to use them. When the brother and sister get to the playground, they turn inside the chain-link fence while the mother waits. The movie children have filed out to the blacktop again to assemble in their groups of three and four. The siblings go among them, proffering their candy, but they look confused—none of the other kids acknowledges them. There are no parents here; they must be realizing how strange that is. Something is wrong with this place, with these unreal children. Can I be in the movie? her son asks again. Bad luck, the assistant says. It’s already been cast. Can I be extra? An extra, the assistant says. That’s what I said. No, not possible, let’s not be rude, she starts to say, but the actor answers: You’d have to come all day and do whatever you’re told. I can do that! And you can’t talk, or play, until you’re told to talk and play, and then it has to be the right way. Please, I want to. What do you think, Tom? No, she thinks. Not my child. His face would be caught forever, expressing someone else’s feelings in someone else’s story. She pictures something being stretched over his head, taut as a swimming cap, with that synthetic smell, that tightness over the brow. The assistant shakes his head. I’m afraid we’re all set, he says. Just put him in a scene, Tom. You know I can’t. But look what I can do, her son says. He runs up the school steps. At the top, he puts his palms on the railing, leans his belly against it, lifts his feet off the ground, and hovers there. She’s embarrassed. She’s about to tell him they need to stop bothering these grown-ups, that it’s time to go home, when he jumps down. He leaps to the side, spins, descends a step, leaps back, ducks under the railing. On the other side he does the same—leaps, spins, descends, leaps, ducks—and again. Back and forth he goes, down and farther down, bowing each time below the black bar that marks the center. It’s like he’s knitting one side of the school to the other. Sometimes he adds a kick, an extra twirl. Ninja moves, ballet moves, moves so particular to his own peculiar self, they have no name and she can think only: That’s him, there he goes. He makes no sound, and neither do the men, watching on the sidewalk, surprised into respect by the opacity of what he’s making, its buoyancy, its gravity. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he stops. That’s just a little dance, he says. Sunday is the last day of spring break, and her husband tells her to relax; he’ll take their son out. She asks where, and he says not to worry about it—they’re having father-son time. Go back to bed, he says. She watches them get ready to leave, the two people she loves most. The boy is talking about how he auditioned for the movie. He says he’ll show his father the dance. Mom, he says, Dad and I are going to talk about places we can move to. He says I can use his Google when we’re on the bus. His Google? So I can look up pictures. Hypothetically move to, her husband says. It’s just for fun. Tell her. Sure, their child says. For fun. Tomorrow, she thinks, everything will go back to normal. They’ll go to school, she’ll join the people flowing to the train. She tidies and makes coffee. She gets out a book. The apartment is so quiet. By lunchtime, she wants her family back. Her husband sends her a laughing face—she’s so pathetic, it’s sweet. He says she can meet them at the restaurant by the school in half an hour. She passes the school’s front steps; she forgets, again, to look closely at the trees. Only one trailer is left—they’re clearing out just in time. A man steps into her path. Ma’am, he says, could you wait here for just a moment? We’re trying to get a last shot. He’s holding up one hand like a crossing guard, looking expectantly at the walkie-talkie in the other. She does as she’s told. She waits a minute. Two. Excuse me but how long will this take? I just need to get to the next block. Not long. Five minutes tops. I’m in a hurry. I have to meet my family. We’ll get you through as quick as we can. This is a little ridiculous. Can’t I just go on the other side of the street? I’m sorry, that’s not possible. How can it not be possible? Look, where’s Tom? Tom knows me. I don’t know who you’re talking about. You’re acting like this is some issue of public safety, like you’re a police officer. But you don’t have any actual power, do you? To stop people from moving through their own neighborhood? From the September 2023 issue: “The Comebacker,” a short story by Dave Eggers And yet she doesn’t push past him. She’s so close, she can see the restaurant; she can see the people at the sidewalk tables; she can see them in the dining shed. They’re laughing and eating and lifting their glasses as if for the same toast. And yes, right there—that’s her family. Her child’s back is to her. Around the edges of his head and shoulders, she can see another outline, the same shape, just taller and broader, like a prediction of the future—the shape of his father. She realizes they’re at the table with the blue chairs. Her son must have remembered. But there were only two of those chairs—where will she sit when she gets there? A band of fear snaps around her, like it’s a crisis, like she can’t just walk over and pull up another seat. But she can’t, because she’s trapped here, waiting. She can’t see the cameras, but she knows they must be rolling. If she starts to run, the cameras will catch her. She’ll be in the movie."

        "year": "2024",
        "story": "Her father is back in the ER. His second time this month. The first was a short stay. After an overnight in emergency and two days in the ward, he was discharged. The doctors told her (and she translated) that her father’s abdominal pains were caused by an acute GI infection, possibly from an earlier viral infection, a diet change, or age. The second time is for the same problem, but much worse. The pain and infection returned tenfold. The emergency doctor is perplexed. So her father is transferred to the surgical ward, where he is monitored by a new team of doctors. Her mother is there as well. In the corner of the room in a chair. On video calls, the daughter can’t quite make out her mother’s face, because of shadows and the position of the camera. She suspects her mother has been crying but can’t prove this. The daughter has never seen her parents cry. Around 5 p.m., her mother drives home. She has trouble driving in the dark. The patient in the next bed talks to himself and has no visitors. A bell chimes over the intercom when a baby is born. Twice for twins. “My eye is bleeding,” her father says, and pulls up his eyelid to show her, over video, the veiny red ball. “It’s the medicine,” he says. “What medicine?” she asks. He has trouble pronouncing its name. The doctor wrote it down on a piece of paper that her father has misplaced. Her mother puts the daughter on FaceTime whenever someone in scrubs enters the room. “Are you the doctor?” the daughter asks, when she sees a woman. “No,” this woman says. She’s the phlebotomist, here to draw the father’s blood. “Are you the doctor?” she asks, when she sees a man. “No,” he says. He’s the nurse for the next bed over. “Are you the doctor?” she asks, when she sees another man. The man hears the question but ignores it. Ignores, too, the phone-sized face sitting on her mother’s palm. So, yes, he is the doctor, and talks in that clear, loud voice of import. “Surgery is not imminent but cannot be entirely ruled out,” he says, while pressing on her father’s abdomen and asking if that hurts. She can’t hear what her father says. She can only hear the doctor: “Yes, Mr. Wang, I acknowledge.” “That was a doctor,” her mother says later. “But not your father’s main doctor.” The vascular surgeon, who does his rounds only at 11:45 p.m. Her mother was told this by the hospitalist, also a doctor, but not the main doctor, not the one who makes the decisions. Big doctor. Little doctor. That’s how her mother starts to differentiate. “You could have been a big doctor,” her mother says, when she remembers the daughter had once considered it. “All these men,” she says, a lifetime homemaker. “You were smart enough. You could have helped.” Which is exactly what the daughter is trying to do, by dropping everything and anything she is doing whenever her mother calls. Afterward, she spends hours on the internet learning the medical jargon so she can translate it for them. The vascular surgeon who calls at 11:45 p.m. says, after reading her father’s most recent CT angiogram, that the diffuse colitis was likely caused by mesenteric ischemia, which was caused by a thrombosis of the false lumen of an SMA dissection. She asks the surgeon to go slower, so she can write the terms down. The surgeon then goes very slow and speaks to her as if she were an idiot. Dissection, not as in frog dissection, but as in a tear in the inner layer of a major blood vessel, like an artery. SMA for the superior mesenteric artery. Duh. The doctors stress that her father’s case is unique. In years of practice, they have seen only one. Etiology unknown and likely spontaneous. Her father doesn’t smoke, drink, have hypertension, or lift 200-pound weights. So the only risk factor the team can think of is that he is an older man of Asian descent. The daughter doesn’t know how to take this information, so she doesn’t translate it. Is being a unique medical case meant to be reassuring? Can your identity really be a meaningful cause? The heparin turns her father’s eyes red. A blood “thinner” to reduce the thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot, as opposed to the thrombus, which is the clot itself, as opposed to the embolus or a free-floating blood clot, broken off from a thrombus, that floats through your arteries to damage another part of the body, like your brain. Whenever her father has an abdominal episode, they need to give him a shot of Dilaudid. Dilaudid is an opioid, and as she is explaining this to her father, his eyes widen, stretching his already thin skin. Opioids. Opium. The Opium Wars, when the West came and used that drug to control the East. “I don’t want to be here,” her father says. “I want to go home.” Home for her parents is Arizona, where, for many years, they ran a motel outside Phoenix. After selling the motel, they retired and bought land on which they now farm. Her mother grew 100 winter melons last year and went door-to-door in their suburb, giving them out to everyone. But most people had no idea what a winter melon was or how to cook one, so they were left outside like decorative gourds until they rotted. A friend tells her to request a translator. “It’s every patient’s right,” says the friend mightily. “And the least a hospital can do.” The daughter knows her parents will not trust a translator. Her friend means well but doesn’t have immigrant parents. The daughter lives in Boston, where she went to college and grad school. She feels more at home there than in Arizona. As for how things are going in the daughter’s life, her dad is in the hospital, yes, but she is also currently unemployed and has recently separated from her husband. Not through any singular, catastrophic event such as infidelity, but because, over nine and a half years, they grew apart. This past month, her husband took up a studio two T stops away, so that if she really needs him, he’ll be close, but under normal circumstances, they won’t cross paths. She hasn’t told her parents about the separation or unemployment. She feels that it will only make the thrombosis worse. Her parents have often asked, “Why, compared with everybody else, are you so far behind?” “No husband” (when the husband was the boyfriend). “No kids” (still true). “Working 12 hours a day at a start-up” (now false). “What kind of life is that?” From the hospital bed, her father reports how many babies were born that day. After another chime goes off, he says, “If you have a child by next year, I will give you 200 winter melons. I will go to USPS myself.” “I’ll just skip the wedding,” she tells her father, who is told daily by different doctors that surgery, though not imminent, cannot be entirely ruled out. She decides, precedent or not, that if the non-imminent surgery becomes imminent, she should be there to help. Her father orders her to go to the wedding. “I’m fine,” he says, though he has lost 18 pounds. “I’m back to the weight I was in my 20s,” he says. “My 20s were a happy time.” In his 20s, her father was still in the homeland. He met her mother, and they married, and lived together in a small apartment with no heat or functional plumbing. To flush, they would pour a basin of water down the toilet. To keep warm, they would burn coal and wear all of their clothes. “We were poor but very happy,” he says. The daughter feels ice in her heart when her father says this. She can’t help but wonder, Happy because you hadn’t left yet? Happy because I wasn’t around? In her 20s, she was under the delusion that she was happy, but in retrospect, she was lost. Back then, she and her parents were estranged. They went months without contact, and even when the motel caught fire or her father was robbed at gunpoint, she chose not to go home. In her mind, they owed her something. That’s what her silly 23-year-old self believed. They had not approved of her lifestyle, her dating, her drinking, and her staying in the Northeast. So she complained about them to anyone and everyone. Her stereotypical Asian immigrant parents. “I really can’t stand them,” she would say, while drinking, smoking on occasion to overcompensate. “We would be better off without each other, doing our own thing.” What was her thing, then? Sitting in a dingy bar with other lost people, wishing her parents away? Her parents used to walk laps in their suburb. Sunrise and sunset, lap after lap, at least three miles a day. The most her father can do now is go past the privacy curtain to the doorway, then, at the doorway, make a slow U-turn back to the bed. His gait is shaky, and he’s hunched. He pushes his own IV pole but holds on to her mother. When her father’s diet advances to soft liquids, a bowl of cream-of-mushroom soup sets off a prolonged episode. It’s the cream he’s not used to. Butter, fat, lactose. After the Dilaudid shot, he is back on only ice chips, which he can’t tolerate, because they are too cold. The daughter tells her mother to ask the little doctor if her father can at least have sips of the hot water that her mother brings dutifully each day in a thermos. Her mother reports back that the little doctor asked the big doctor and that the question was acknowledged but went unanswered. So the daughter finds the number of the nursing bay and calls that. The nurse on the line is not her father’s, so is not clear on the situation. The daughter hears her own panic: “He can’t handle cold food. He microwaves bananas. Even lukewarm water would be fine.” The gentle nurse says, “I understand.” Some hours later, sips of lukewarm water are approved. The new patient in the neighboring bed drinks a can of Diet Coke with every meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. He takes his pills with Coke. Her father is horrified and amazed. Amazed, too, that when his diet advances again, they give him chocolate pudding and green Jell-O. When the Jell-O comes, he sends the daughter a picture. Fluorescent green. Radioactive green. Slime. “How can this be considered health food?” Her father reminisces about the homeland, where hospital patients are given soup cooked from a whole fish. The only problem with whole fish is the bones. Should one get caught in your throat, you must be wheeled to the special department dedicated to plucking out fish bones from throats. “During New Year, that department always has a long line,” her father says. “You were once in that line. You were just a toddler.” Besides the daily FaceTimes with her parents, the daughter is roped into long group texts about the wedding. Guests who know one another band together to discuss the logistics of getting to the vineyard venue, which is just far enough from Boston to require a car. Rather than carpool with anyone, she decides to ask her husband for their car, which he took because he used it more for work. Their car. His car. She texts, “Hey can I borrow the car?” He agrees and, later that day, even drives it over. They chat for a bit about the wedding, which he will no longer be attending. They agree on a fabricated story to explain his absence. She considers updating him on her father, technically still his father-in-law. Her husband would have smart things to say about the situation: “What your father is receiving is equal but not equitable treatment.” “Jell-O is meant to create a sense of nostalgia for the average American.” He, too, would have suggested a translator. The growing-apart could also be seen in her disengagement. A few years ago, they began splitting the holidays. Come December, she’d fly alone to Phoenix, while he’d stay at his family home, in Newton. Her husband comes from a large family. Yet even when the long table was full of people, she noticed that, after saying grace together, they took turns to speak. Her husband was the one to point out that she and her parents had a habit of talking over one another. She wasted a lot of mental energy trying to disprove this fact. In the end, he gives her the car keys, and she doesn’t update him. She asks him how he’s getting home now. “Bus,” he says, hands by his side, no ring. He wishes her a good time at the wedding. On the drive to the vineyard, she has to pull over. Two surgeons have come into her father’s room to explain what they’ve learned from radiology. The tone is ominous, and the daughter is sitting on the side of a highway, rocked by the gusts of fast cars. “This is serious stuff, Mr. Wang,” the younger surgeon starts. “Dissections never truly heal, and conditions like these have been known to exacerbate.” He lists fatal aneurysmal rupture as an example. At this point, the older surgeon steps in: “Dissections can heal over time; good news is, blood flow has been restored to your intestines. You will require close monitoring but no surgery, though the chance of future surgeries cannot be entirely negated.” Having listened to dozens of doctors of late, she has noticed a pattern: The younger ones think everyone is going to die. She asks when her father will be discharged. The surgeons say they don’t make these decisions. They’re just here to assess the need for surgery. Had her husband been beside her, he would have inserted himself and said, “But you haven’t really done a good job of that, have you? You’ve kept my father-in-law on a terribly restrictive diet. You’ve told us no surgery today or tomorrow, but you never eliminate the possibility. Given your level of training and education, how can you not know?” She would have been the bigger person and thanked the surgeons. Then, despite being equally frustrated, equally helpless, and more or less on the same side, she and her husband would have argued. Back on the road, she puts her parents on speaker and listens to her father complain about the pudding, the Jell-O, the bucket of ice chips they dump out and refill. He is nothing but pleasant with medical staff but demands to know from his daughter why, if no surgery, he can’t be discharged, and why, if no surgery, no one knows when he will be discharged. He’s already been in the ward for 10 days. Four different patients have been in the bed next to his. Two hundred and sixty-nine babies have been born. He worries about the bill. “The medical team decides when you leave,” repeats the daughter. “They have to decide as a team. You are still not well.” Her father insists that he’s well enough. He raises his arm that’s hooked to four IVs, two for medication, two for nutrients. He hasn’t been allowed to shower because of these IVs. He laments getting old. He worries about the bill. “Seventy-thousand dollars,” he says. The total amount a hospital had once charged someone he knows. “But you don’t pay all of that.” “For every five-minute visit, the doctor charged $150.” “That’s just how it is.” “Sounds like a scam.” While her father talks, her mother says she also doesn’t like the American health-care system. “Why can’t they just send one doctor and one nurse? Why an army of people that changes every day? And why is each doctor only responsible for one thing? The human body is not a car.” In fact, the human body is a car, the daughter thinks. How else does a sane person prepare themselves to cut into another person? “It’s not about like or dislike,” says the daughter. “It’s what we have.” Her mother reminisces about the homeland. At the wedding, the daughter wears a black dress with a black shawl. She hadn’t meant to wear all black, but she’d packed with little to no reflection, thus forgetting all of her toiletries for the night. She inspects herself in the mirror. The words fatal aneurysmal rupture come to mind. She’s known the bride since college and, at the pre-ceremony hour, dodges as many mutual friends as she can. But one finally corners her and asks immediately where her husband is. This curious person is joined by another, and soon she is surrounded by cheerful, eager people in pairs. The fabricated missing-husband story is told again and again. She also has a work story that is truthful. Had anyone asked, she could have carried on an entirely valid conversation about the risks and rewards of start-ups and what her next steps will be in finding a new role. The ceremony forces her to remember her own. Outdoors. Springtime. Initially, her father had been hesitant to walk her down the aisle—no tradition of his—and only after much insistence from her and her mother had he changed his mind. Which reminds her that after the ceremony, she has to call him again, to remind him to stand up and walk around the room. Standing helps circulation. Standing saves lives. Before the reception, she makes the call from a dim hallway by the banquet room. When her father doesn’t answer, she calls her mother. When her mother doesn’t answer, she calls her father. Back and forth she pings. Mother. Father. Mother. Father. She feels her entire chest coated in sweat. She feels completely alone. Then, as she is about to leave the reception to drive back to Boston and get on the first flight to Arizona, her mother calls her back, annoyed: “What? All the ringing and buzzing. What? What?” Her parents have just come from the bathroom, where her mother had wiped down her father’s body with a damp towel. “He smelled,” her mother says. Even the other patient had complained. “Everything is fine,” her mother says, and pans to her father, who waves and has a clean, white towel draped over his neck. The banquet room is filled with circular tables, and she is at the college table, with the same pairs of cheerful people. The seat to her right is empty. She takes her husband’s name card and folds it repeatedly until it is just a tiny, insignificant square. She imagines her parents will press her for a cause. Something must have driven you two apart. Etiology is never spontaneous. But even when she tries, she can’t cobble together an answer—there’d been no gleaming moment of clarity in which they both knew, just many dull moments of discontent. It must have been their identities, then, an incompatibility that took nine and a half years to figure out. She considers never telling her parents. What would happen if she never did? It’s not like her husband and her parents were close, though that was less his fault than hers. She had intentionally picked a man her parents would never understand. So, all along, she has been the problem. The bad daughter, bad at both embracing her given family and creating her own. During dinner, she and the person seated to her left attempt conversation but lose momentum. After a while, he turns the other direction and looks relieved. During the toasts, she drinks wine and runs a napkin across her teeth and mouth. The bride’s family members stand up one by one, offer their well wishes, and say something they remember about the bride. What she remembers is that in college, they had crazy late-night escapades. They stayed out until the morning. No curfew or irate parents waited at home to punish them. So, like this, the image of her father in the doorway comes back to her. A younger, heavier man with no IV pole, just hands gripping the doorframe, face darkened, ready to scream. When he used to scream, she used to cower. Only anger she saw then, not I’m angry because I’m scared to lose you; I’m scared to lose you because you’re all I have."

        "story": "In Berlin, the winter sky is screwed on so tight that all the world beneath becomes dark and gray and grim. On my runs around Wannsee, from the corner of my eye, I could glimpse the furious ghosts of the place seething in the middle of the lake, transforming into whitecaps if I looked at them directly. Around some bends, I’d come across naked old men, bright red with the cold of their swim, vigorously toweling off their withered loins. When I’d come to the ferry launch to Pfaueninsel, the peacocks across the spit of water would cry out so loudly in their winter rutting, I could easily imagine that the island was entirely made of peacocks, in layers four thick upon the ground, that the castle there was wrapped in a hissing sheet of iridescent blue, the million eyes of Argos on their tail feathers staring up, affronted by the low gray clouds. Then, in mid-April, just as despair crept in and I began to think that we would be stuck in chill darkness for good, the lid of the sky blew off, and the sun poured down, and the earth leaped up in joy to meet it. A green fur grew on all the bereft trees and dirt, and the tulips stood up and unfurled themselves, the brave avant-garde of more color to come. Even the German people who’d so dourly walked their dogs along the lake paths all winter began to smile and nod in greeting. But the ghosts still wrestled mutely in the middle of the lake; even the sun couldn’t burn those off. It was a week or so into this astonishing reversal of winter that my first love, my first friend, Leslie, called me for the last time. My heart seized; nowadays, he only ever called to relate tragedy—our high-school heartthrob who had died in a motorboat accident, my roommate from college who’d overdosed. Leslie wasn’t an oracle; he was just still on social media. There had been a time, long ago, when we didn’t need to call, when we could talk without talking in our separate beds across the little town where we were raised, chatting away in our minds until one of us fell asleep or was interrupted, and then we’d pick up the conversation mid-sentence at school the next day. I’d discovered him in first grade. He’d been there all along, since nursery school, but we’d somehow never connected until I turned around fast in the lunch line with a fork in my hand and accidentally stabbed him in the stomach. The injury wasn’t serious, he was fine, no blood even, but it hurt. He was always brave, though, and when he cried, he cried silently so as not to get me in trouble. I was impressed. I asked him what his name was, and he said, Leslie, but in a whisper, holding his gap teeth behind his hand, because already he’d been relentlessly teased for the gap and for having a girl’s name. From that lunch on, he was mine, and nobody ever dared tease him again, because back then I was a biter. Leslie wasn’t calling with tragedy this time; he was coming to Berlin for a couple of nights. He had to fly over to set up the house on his husband’s Greek island for the summer and could get away early to come see me. Why wouldn’t I want to see my oldest friend? he said. And I mean that literally. God, honey, I’ve been looking at your husband’s pictures of you on the ’gram, when did you decide to let yourself go? We both laughed, I a little sourly. It was true, the Berlin winter had seeped into my soul, and I had let myself go gray, let myself have my fill of beer and pommes rot-weiss. The way I looked must have been shocking to him, married as he was to an haute couture designer and now living in a world without fat or blemish, only expensive fabric on expensive bone. I had yet to meet Leslie’s husband, had not even been invited to the wedding, which rankled some. When I’d asked him about it, he had let out a puff of exasperated air and said, We only had four people there, they are all Damien’s friends, they’re so famous they’re not even real human beings. Bringing a normie into that mess would have been cruel to you, believe you me. When I’d said, But still, I’m me, you’re you, he’d said, Oh, honey, if it’s any consolation, not even my parents were invited. This was no consolation at all; I knew the parental history. Later, after my stung ego had eased up a bit, I felt sad for my friend, not allowed his own friends at his wedding; he had fought for so long, transforming himself from a street kid into a wildly successful interior designer without even a college degree, and as soon as he’d married Damien, he’d been forced to give up his career to become something like his husband’s majordomo. It wasn’t right; none of it was right. But Leslie’s allegiances had shifted, and he was happy, deliriously happy, and I found I couldn’t say this to him anymore. In revenge, I wore while bleaching the bathroom floor the one piece of Damien’s I owned. True, it was a skirt from his collaboration with a big-box store, but I’d felt sexy in it. In any event, the prospect of soon seeing my oldest friend was a light radiating out into the rest of my life. I ran faster; I ate fewer potatoes; I yelled at my kids less. Then, the next week, he texted to tell me that the few days in Berlin had to be curtailed to only one night, alas. And the day of, when I was already waiting at the restaurant where his assistant had booked lunch, he texted to say that, oops, Damien needed the plane, he could spare only the afternoon. Could I come to Mitte in, like, four hours? He needed to take pictures of something in the Altes Museum, and we’d have time to do dinner before he had to go back to the airport. I was upset, of course, but there was nothing I could do. I had to see him. Despite recent changes, Leslie would always share the private throne room inside me with my husband and my sons. For a long time, he’d been a separate piece of me, preferring to spend most of his time in my loud and messy house, full of pets and the friends of my brother and sister, chaotic with music and life and games, which Leslie, with his long-limbed, goofy sweetness, had joined with almost fervent zeal, his high-pitched laughter making everyone else laugh. Read: Lauren Groff has written a new gospel Leslie was an only child, and the rare times I’d spent the night at his house, I’d felt tentative in the cathedral hush. His was a large and supermodern home, on a hill above the lake, two miles outside town. There, you could stand on the flagstone veranda and look down on Main Street with binoculars to track the ant-size people who were so huge in our daily lives. The floors were dark, shining slate; the ceilings were 25 feet tall; the furniture was precious and uncomfortable and looked to my child’s eye like the carapaces of huge insects frozen in place. His mother was extraordinarily beautiful—Leslie got his glow from her—but almost entirely silent, floating pale-haired through the house with a chuckling glass of ice water that she replaced at exactly five in the afternoon with vodka from the freezer. His father was a froggish man, red-faced, also with long limbs, whose torso seemed somehow inflated, like a rubber hot-water bottle. Poor Leslie had inherited his face, with its huge, thin-lipped mouth and bulging eyes. My friend has never been beautiful, even during his years as a twink, though, of course, he overbrims with charm. His father was also the kind of man who sucked the oxygen out of every room and left you gasping. He loved gossip, jokes, pointed observations. Only at night did he go silent, though even the night hours in Leslie’s house were startling, marked by a clock that cuckooed the hour, then sang what in adulthood I would understand to be a Wagner lied. I hated being in that house. They kept it too cold, and Leslie was not allowed to hang the undeniably excellent drawings he did on the wall of his own room. I once woke to see the shadowy shape of his father in the doorway, his silken robe parted. Whenever Leslie’s father saw me, he had a savage impulse to needle me with dumb-blonde jokes over and over until I broke down and cried. That this adult man absolutely needed to make sure I knew how small and powerless and stupid I, a little girl, was compared with him has, I’m afraid, been the subject of hours and hours of therapy. The last day I’d see Leslie, I came, very slowly, on the S-Bahn to Museum Island. The weather was gray again, drizzling and cold, but the purple peonies at the flower shops in the station gave me courage. I wandered around the Neues Museum and had a coffee there, then sat on the steps of the Altes Museum, watching the tourists huddle and dart off, mesmerized by how they behaved like fish near coral, their colors the same brightness, their noise the same noise as the chewing one heard under the water. At last, when I had begun to shiver with cold, I smelled Leslie before I saw him, an expensive custom perfume of bergamot and orange and musk, and his hands were over my eyes, and I took them down and kissed his palms. He was laughing his high, delighted Leslie laugh. You looked so forlorn sitting there, he said. A lost little puppy. Oh, I thought, how strange to see people whom you’ve loved for so long. You don’t really see their current face; instead, you see the faces of your greatest intensity of love. I could see my 7-year-old friend, my 11-year-old friend, my 18-year-old friend, not really the middle-aged one. Still, I sensed something different about him now. Let’s go get you warmed up, he said, and he linked my arm in his, and we went inside the old columned building. At the desk, though, he stood aside for me to buy the tickets, behavior that felt a little strange for a man with a Greek island and a private jet. We walked slowly through the ancient torsos—You must change your life, I intoned gravely, which he blinked at, puzzled—the Etruscan jewelry, the Roman busts. He seemed to know where he was going, and we arrived at a little room on the second floor called the Garden of Delights. Inside was a circus of priapism. Ancient penises with wings, Leda being reamed by the swan, lamps in the shape of little satyrs, their members so huge and painfully engorged that they touched the ground. I said, I suppose that one set fire to the little hole in the urethra, what is it called? Leslie said, The glans? No, I said, I got it, the meatus. Leslie giggled, then set to work with his cellphone, taking picture after picture, in close-up. I thought about when we were 12, in the little Methodist graveyard where we’d liked to gossip and talk about death. One day, we’d decided out of curiosity to French-kiss. Leslie’s mouth had been cold and wet, and tasted like corn chips, which he’d just been eating. I’d fled immediately. All night, I’d turned in bed, unable to even try to talk to Leslie in my mind, growing ever more certain that now I was going to die of AIDS, that I was probably pregnant now, that I was doomed to have to marry Leslie and have his baby at 12 years old and spend the rest of my life kissing cold, wet corn-chip kisses. But in the morning, when I saw him at school, he’d looked at me, startled, and then his mouth had spread and spread in his froggy smile, and then I’d started laughing too, and we’d set the kiss event aside and never attempted another one again. I stared so long at one hyper-endowed lamp that it turned its head, stuck out its cracked terra-cotta tongue, and licked all the way around its mouth, lascivious, shimmying. Leslie said, suddenly, He’s thinking of a collection inspired by this room, and put his phone away. Who, Damien? I said, stupidly. Yes, Leslie said. Damien remembered this place from, like, a decade ago, and he wanted me to take photos of every single thing in the room. How’s he doing, I asked, this husband of yours whom I’ve never met, if he’s actually real. Leslie said, He’s real. He’s amazing. Just absolutely amazing. You have no idea what it’s like living with a genius. Oh? What is it like, I said, and he shrugged and smiled and said, Amazing. I was stung; he was protecting someone with his vagueness, but I wasn’t clear who. We came back down through the dim antiquities, the nine carved Muses on a sarcophagus gesturing above our shoulders. Now that his task was done, he could focus on me, and he asked me rapid-fire questions that I answered as honestly as I could: Yes, the boys were furious with us for dragging them to Berlin, no, they don’t like their school at all, yes, they were the most gorgeous humans ever to set foot on the planet, funny and loving and smart and good, yes, I do in fact wonder how they came out of me, haha, it’s true, yes, my husband wanted to see Leslie too, he says he’s sorry he had work to do today, no, I’m not getting any work done myself, this place is too exciting, I can’t focus. Ugh, Leslie said, nobody wants to work anymore, it’s a cultural disease. Then we went out into the darkening afternoon. Hey, Leslie said, I’m working on my bikini body—let’s say we skip dinner and just go have a drink? You already have a bikini body, I said, everybody has a bikini body, besides, I am starving, you had me skip lunch, if you remember. But he either didn’t hear me or affected not to, and said he knew an amazing bar, they always went there when they were in Berlin, I’d love it, and if I was really hungry, he thought they had food there, and swept me along. He led me by the hand down the damp and windy street, where idling for him was a gleaming black car of such absurd luxury that I laughed. Oh, he said, it’s the airport’s, not ours, we don’t keep a car in Berlin. I slid onto leather that both looked and felt like actual butter. For all my socialism, I luxuriated in the reflected heat upon my face, this dazzle, this excess, the champagne chilling in an ice bucket, which Leslie fell upon with relief, popping the bottle, pouring out coupes of perfect honeyed chill. We slid through Berlin surreally in this purring car, bubbles striking our tongues. Until then, I had mostly seen the center of the city as excitingly gritty—piss in stairwells, graffiti atop graffiti. Seeing my friend so comfortable in comfort, my old guttersnipe buddy who’d once lived for years in actual squalor, felt odd. Of course, he had started off in smoothness and sleekness up in that sad house of his on the hill, but the Thanksgiving of his freshman year in college, all hyped up by his campus LGBTQ alliance and against my counsel, he’d decided to come out to his parents. That same night, as my own family was passing around appetizers, he showed up at my house, unable to speak for weeping, his skin reddening into what would later be a hideous black eye. We had lost some of our ability to speak without speaking by then; enough life had streamed through us without the other person there to witness it. But while everyone else was eating stuffing and pumpkin pie downstairs, he lay on the foldout bed next to mine, and I held him, big spoon to his little, and I came to understand what had happened as vividly as if I had been in the room. His mother had bought a turkey dinner from a local caterer and put it on her own mother’s sleek porcelain platter. His father had been drinking bourbon, glass after glass, ever since the food had arrived hours earlier. Leslie had been quivering with anxiety, a big mistake, because when his father saw weakness, he leaped on it, he couldn’t help it, the man was a hunter, a predator, a kind of jungle cat. When at last my friend had broken the tension and announced that he was gay, his father had stood up and taken a fistful of turkey and thrown it in Leslie’s face, then leaned over and punched him in the eye. Before he’d left the room, he’d said, with his back turned, That’s it. You’re no child of mine. Leslie’s mother had picked turkey off her son’s shirt, whispering, Hush now, hush now, stop crying, he’ll hear, and then she’d kissed him, and whispered, I always knew, of course I did. A mother knows. But you’d better go down to your friend’s house, just get out of his sight. After his devastated week with us, my parents drove him back to college, and he finished out the term and spent winter break at my house, but when he went back to school, he was barred from the dorm; his father had withdrawn his payment for the semester, they were sorry, he was no longer officially matriculated in that institution. He’d hitchhiked to my school and spent a few weeks on my common-room couch, until my roommates had revolted. They loved Leslie, he was so funny and kind and smart, but he wasn’t a student there, and his feet at the time reeked like dead things, they were sorry, they sympathized with his plight, they were allies! But they’d have to tell the dean if he wasn’t gone by Friday. That day, I withdrew every penny from my savings account, all my earnings from lifeguarding during high-school summers, all my graduation and birthday money, and gave it to my friend. He sat for a long while with his face in his hands, saying, I should just kill myself, nobody would care. I said fiercely that if he killed himself, I would kill him again, and at last he smiled wanly and packed up. Whatever he needed, he just had to call, I said, I’d figure it out for him. He’d hitchhiked to San Francisco and lived on my money for about two months, after which he’d declined rapidly. I took a dining-hall job washing dishes so that I could send him a check faithfully every week—my hands can still hold searing-hot plates without pain. But some months, I couldn’t send one, because he had no address to send things to. Other months, he managed to call but couldn’t speak, only sobbed into the receiver. Along with the jobs he told me about—the go-go dancing, the house painting, the bartending, the dog walking—there were darker jobs he hinted at. I think he sold what he had, which was his youth. For a time, he was addicted to something, but he wouldn’t tell me why his speech was slurred. When he finally washed up in a steadier place, he was so proud that he bought a disposable camera and took pictures of his room and sent the camera to me to develop. But when I got the prints back, the room was so little and sparse—four walls with a giant poster of David Bowie on one, a bed scrupulously made with a cheap wool blanket—that I ached at the difference between my hopes for him and his reality. When I saved up enough to go visit him over spring break during my junior year, he was house-sitting for a pair of kind elderly lesbians in the Marina. He’d met them when he’d shown up with a crew to paint their house, and they’d worried about him and semi-adopted him. He seemed sober but looked pale and haunted when he picked me up at the airport, and I felt a strangeness between us during that trip, which couldn’t end fast enough. He had no money for restaurants or tickets, of course, so I bought us groceries, and we cooked and went for long walks and talked and talked, awkwardly, with hours-long pauses between bursts of conversation. At the end, he promised he’d pay me back for all the money I’d sent, which by that point was something close to $10,000. Not that I’m a person who keeps accounts like this, but even with all his private jets and Greek islands, he has yet to repay me. I don’t think it is intentional; I think he was so ashamed to have taken from me that he cast the debt from his mind. If he were to write me a check today, I don’t know if I would take it, though perhaps he could pay for his own museum ticket. We slid to a stop before a bar with a neon sign above a green door. It didn’t look like a haven for the cognoscenti, but one had to ring the bell to be let in, and the person who opened it was about 10 feet tall, with a shaved head and the sharp-boned face of an angel, and so many piercings, she looked like she’d been bedazzled by a bored child. Les! she cried out, wrapping him in her spidery arms. She looked behind him for Damien and seemed piqued when she saw me. God, Anya, you look incredible, let me take a picture for Damien, he might be able to use you, Leslie said, and once inside the dark bar, he took about 50 flash photos of Anya, her hand on her hip, looking very tough. She led us to a table, and Leslie said, My usual, thank you, and she said, Got it, then frowned down at me. Out of panic, I picked the first thing I saw on the menu, the Voltaire, a drink with cognac and quince. Leslie said, wisely, To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize, and raised an eyebrow. What? I said. Voltaire said that, Leslie said. And you call yourself a college graduate? He still had his phone in his hand and got distracted, poking and prodding it, so I was left alone to look around. The bar was full of Berliners, gorgeous girls with ratty mullets and 1970s eyeglasses, skinny boys slouching in all black. The bar was illumined by candles and an uplit line of mostly esoteric liquors along the full-length mirror against the back wall. Only when Anya delivered our drinks did my old friend remember I was there with him and put the phone away. He gulped down half of his drink in one go, then leaned forward and filled me in on all the gossip from our town, his face lighting up the way it used to. The divorces, the affairs, the tragedies in the lives of our classmates, people I didn’t think about more than once a decade. Nothing about himself. I watched Leslie speak, until I suddenly understood what had become so strange about his face. It wasn’t Botox or any kind of plastic surgery, subtle or not; he’d had his teeth fixed, and that glorious gap in them that I’d loved so much had disappeared. Read: ‘Birdie,’ a short story by Lauren Groff Oh, I interrupted him, Leslie. Your teeth. He put his hand up in alarm, then, remembering that I knew him best with his old set, grimaced to show off the new. He looked like a chimp demonstrating aggression. Aren’t they wonderful? he said. I feel like a new man. Damien was against it, he said the gap gave my face a certain rakishness, but I’ve hated it ever since I first looked in a mirror. You know, when I was a kid, if I forgot at dinner and accidentally smiled with my teeth and my dad saw the gap, he’d make me stand up and show my teeth while he threw toothpicks at me like darts, trying to get one through the space, Leslie said, smiling. I could tell that this was a story he’d told many times at parties, and that it had made people laugh. Oh, Leslie, I thought, sick. Don’t break bread with the kind of person who’d laugh at that. Aloud, I said, bitterly, Your goddamned father. At this, Leslie flinched, saying, Jesus, have some respect. My dad is totally demented right now, it’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen, he’s in a nursing home down in Sarasota crying all the time because he has no idea where he is or who he is or what’s happening to him, all day he’s just wandering around so confused, it’s like watching someone tormented, like someone in hell. My poor mom is just devastated, she visits him every day, it’s wringing her out, she’s never been strong anyway, you know that. It’s just breaking her to bits. So yeah, okay, fine, he wasn’t the best father, but he’s still a human being, damn. He deserves our pity. I suppose I still have a biter in me, because I said, Right, right, and does his dementia automatically absolve him for everything he did? Are you actually kidding me right now, Leslie? What are you talking about, he said, in a very low voice, because mine had made the Berliners around us stop in their conversations and look at us. You mean that time when I came out? Yeah, those were some shitty years, but I got through them, look at me, I’m absolutely fucking thriving, they made me what I am, I pulled myself up by the bootstraps, I didn’t make any excuses, I worked. I’m the fucking American dream, baby. Anyways, not that you care, my father apologized, I forgave him. Why the fuck would you still be angry when I’m not? What the fuck is wrong with you? This is when it all came boiling up out of my molten core, the mystery that all these decades I’d felt deep down, this terrible thing sensed, those sudden interruptions when we were talking in our separate beds across the village at night, that vision or dream I’d had of his father in a parted robe in the doorway, my revulsion for the man, the way my friend had made himself small in the world, apologetic, hiding himself, the way his father had watched with a gleam in his eye when he made dumb-blonde jokes at me until I cried, that fascist soul of that fascist man spreading its tarry blackness all over everything he touched. I couldn’t know, I didn’t know for sure what he had done to my friend. But I did know. I did. Somehow. Perhaps. Maybe the knowledge was written on my face—maybe, for a brief moment, Leslie could hear inside my mind again the way we’d spoken when we were little. He pushed back from the table so violently that my Voltaire splashed all over the table and onto my lap. In the shock of cold, I thought he was angry that I was witness to his deepest shame, but he hissed through his new, perfect teeth, Fuck you. You knew. All along. And then he was gone through the door. I was alone with my wet lap, my confusion, my rage, Anya glaring down at me, the angel of punks. I paid, I escaped. Out in the street, rain had begun for real, a rain that would turn overnight into ice and raze back all the tender new green that had emerged, leave the tulip blossoms withered brown twists on the stem. I dialed Leslie again and again, walking through the rain to the S-Bahn station, but he did not pick up, and at last my phone informed me regretfully that I was blocked. On the train, shivering, I tried an email, but he had preemptively emailed to say, You’re dead to me. Don’t contact me again. And when I tried to respond, my email bounced back. Now June is here, the lengthening days so rich with sunshine that light spills out everywhere like coins and bars of gold, spilling upon the vigorous green leaves fully and lushly emerged, upon the real cuckoos marking crazy time and the swans in their elegant glissades across the water, upon the crowds of naked youths sunbathing on the hillsides around Schlachtensee and Krumme Lanke, upon me in my endless all-day walks around Wannsee and Potsdam. I can only walk now, because I injured myself trying to run out my grief in the weeks after I saw Leslie—and I have to walk so much, often from the moment I wake up until the moment the boys come home from school and I can hold their animal bodies against my animal body and feel the batteries of their hot hearts recharge me again. Leslie is a person who holds fast to his actions; we have been severed, I know, I can feel it inside me, it is permanent. Voltaire did not in fact say, To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize. That’s the wisdom of an actual neo-Nazi. When I cry on my walks, the ghosts laugh at me from their heaving white masses at the center of the lake, where the sailboats slice over them; the ghosts of Wannsee mock me. They, by existing, remind me of what a new friend said once during the winter, a friend who is both German and American. She said that being German has a sense of heaviness to it—that the Germans are at least wrestling with their guilt and that we Americans have been trained to pretend that the wounds don’t exist, which only means they fester inside. A few days ago, I took the ferry across to Pfaueninsel, thick now with roses and wisteria. The castle at the center of the island was wrapped in renovation plastic, not in peacock feathers; peacocks did not seethe four thick upon the ground. I saw only a few dozen at most, shouting out in their strange, catlike cries. One approached me as I sat on a bench in my desolation, a male trailing his feathers behind him like the long train of a ball gown. I gave him the pretzel I’d bought but didn’t want, and he pecked at it for a long while, then rewarded me by lifting the strong muscles that carried his tail, unfurling his great glorious fan only a few feet from me so that I could be intimidated by his beauty, his shine, the shocking colors, the eyes on his feathers all at once winking at me, as if to say, Don’t worry, this will pass, we will survive. This is the way of things, we carry our gorgeous burdens, we go through life losing. By autumn, all his tail feathers will have fallen out; he will go into the long, dark winter bare of his glory. But this is the nature of the greatest gifts, the eyes of Argos say; they are never meant to last forever."

        "story": "Frankie met Lucia in that summer of tombstoners and storms, when the tomato plants got blight and the bean plants fruited early. She lived in a small cluster of houses just north of Lulworth, where the news consisted only of tomato plants getting blight and bean plants fruiting early. She was sitting in the dirt tunnel beneath the beans, which by now had shriveled in the sun like exhumed fingers, when she called up Beach Ices and it all began. I saw the ad, she said on the phone, getting ready to say she had no experience but a wealth of enthusiasm. Well, it’s a case of needing a body in the room, a woman on the other end said. Okay, Frankie said. Okay, the woman repeated. So you can do it? By the time Frankie cycled to Beach Ices the next morning, she was dripping right through her T-shirt, her scalp itchy and hot from the helmet. Beach Ices sat just beside the huge, sprawling car park, with chalky dust swirling perpetually in the air. The beach was popular, especially in the summer, partly because of the Cove’s unusual geography and Jurassic heritage, and partly because a Bollywood film had been shot nearby in 2010. At 8:30 a.m., few people were there yet, just some dog walkers and fishermen and shirtless guys dragging paddleboards across the sloped car park. Frankie approached Beach Ices, clinging onto her bike, wiping the sweat off her forehead, and wondering what she should say. Behind the half-open counter, she could see a gorgeous, fat butch girl with a buzz cut wiping the surface down. Some radio music was coming from the back, a Spanish song that had been on the charts for ages, and the girl was singing along while she scrubbed. Frankie went over to the little hatch and squinted up. Hi, hello, she said, and the girl looked at her, her nose ring catching in the light, and said, We’re not open yet, and Frankie said, I don’t want an ice cream, and the girl said, Well, we’re quite literally an ice-cream shop, and Frankie said, No, no, I mean I’m starting here, I’m working, and the girl said, Oh. Well, come ’round the back, then. The back was a place with lots of bins, concrete flooring, and an older woman sitting on a plastic chair smoking. She had blond hair pulled back in a bun, hard eyes, and a strappy top with a gingham apron around her waist. Frankie? she said. Frankie nodded. You didn’t tell me someone was starting today, the butch girl said. The older woman ignored her. Put your bike down. I’m Ingrid, that’s Lucia. This is the shop. This was pretty much the extent of Ingrid’s introductions. She dug out a crusty black apron from a cupboard, thrust it into Frankie’s arms, and said something about business in the village before disappearing. Business in the village, mmhmm, Lucia said after she left. They were standing in the main room of the ice-cream parlor, a small, square space with big fridges, storage shelves, a crappy-looking coffee machine, and freezers full of ice cream. The air was thick and sweet, dazed flies wandering the expanse of it and coming to rest on sugary stains on the counter or humming around the radio. What do you mean? Frankie said. She was slow to understand social dynamics, feeling that she was always floating somewhere, slightly abstracted from reality. This was what she had tried to explain to her old friendship group. They had been drunk one afternoon at Eleanor’s house, lazing in the back garden, their bodies loosening, trickling into the earth. Above them, the sky was fat with clouds, spewing an uncomfortable humidity that made moving feel laborious and dizzying. Passing around a strange mixture of peach schnapps, vodka, and orange juice, the girls had told one another secrets and fears while Frankie watched in woozy fascination. When they’d asked her to speak, she’d done so without thinking. You are all like baby birds, she said, eating mashed-up food from each other’s mouths. Well, Lucia said, slumping against the counter, You’d think she were this prim-and-proper-type woman, right, what with the gingham apron and living in one of those cute rose-bushed cottages down the road, and moaning about the village not being what it used to be, but she gets it more than anyone. While I’m sweating my backside off scooping ice cream all day, she goes home or out back there and reclines while she scrolls through dating apps. Oh? Frankie laughed. She has a thing for these hulky Dorsetshire farmer guys, right, and I’ve seen her—she says some bullshit about trying out their cow’s milk for new ice cream, even though she buys the ice cream in, but really she’s off fucking in the back of tractors or amongst the wheat fields. I’m sort of jealous, Frankie said. You wanna fuck in the back of tractors? Well, no, not specifically. You’re jealous of people who fuck? I don’t know. Frankie turned away, pretending to wipe down the plastic ice-cream cover and wishing she hadn’t said anything. The truth was, she hadn’t fucked, and when she had tried, she’d felt like a limpet clinging to a rock, or a mewing lonely dog. Lucia, Frankie imagined, was above this desperation. Hmm, Lucia said. The day passed by with a feverish quality. The tourist season was in full swing, wailing red-faced children and indecisive families washing like swell waves to the Beach Ices door. Frankie stumbled around to Lucia’s command, sliding the ice-cream-fridge door back and forth, scooping honeycomb, black currant, and sorbet, saying, Oh, yes, locally sourced, just ’round the corner, really! And the slim women in straw hats would say, Oh, good, marvelous, you ought to check nowadays, what with, you know, and they’d point up to the sky, the sweating open mass of it, and Frankie would say, Ohh yes, adopting their solemnity, thinking of the ozone, squashing big balls of salted caramel into cones. I fucking hate tourists, Lucia said in a moment of afternoon quiet. They sank down onto the plastic stools behind the counter, Lucia slurping from a can of Tango Orange, Frankie eating from a small tub of mint chocolate chip. Why? Frankie said. Why not? Well, we wouldn’t have jobs otherwise. People are idiots, Lucia said. Remember during lockdown when people went feral, driving 90 miles to get here and polluting the place and jumping off the rocks? They call that tombstoning, you know. I remember that, Frankie said. She hadn’t thought about it since then. It seemed so long ago, patted over with new dirt. She tried to remember if anyone had died. You’ll get sick of that soon, Lucia said, standing up and yawning. Sick of what? Frankie said. The ice cream, silly. Oh. She watched Lucia begin to move around again. She was so unlike anyone Frankie knew, so much stranger and more familiar, with her piercings and opinions. She was only a year older than Frankie, 17 to Frankie’s 16, but she seemed already out there in the world. It made Frankie aware of herself in a way she hadn’t really bothered to be before. I’m thinking of cutting my hair, she said suddenly. Oh, yeah? Lucia glanced over at her. At closing time, Ingrid returned. She didn’t ask how Frankie’s first day had been, just stood by the till chewing gum, counting out notes and coins. Frankie wondered if she really had been fucking in the wheat fields, or if Lucia was having her on. When Ingrid finished, she sectioned off two small piles, one for Lucia and one for Frankie. She handed them over, told them see you tomorrow, and that was that. At home, Frankie’s family were all out or squirreled away, so she had nobody to tell about her first day. Instead, she made herself a cheese sandwich and thought anew about her family, in the way that meeting different people prompts you to rethink the ones you already know. Her parents were not in love, she knew, but rather lived together like two solitary cats grown used to tolerating the other in their space. Her father was a man who said often that he had chosen nothing in his life, that things had just unfolded, and that that was his lot. He ate sardines for breakfast, he drove to work at the insurance office, he tended to his beans and tomatoes, and he went to sleep. Her mother was preoccupied with cleaning. Her own mother, who’d slept with her wedding dress laid in bed beside her, had died a slow and bitter death of lung cancer, leaving in her bungalow an obsessive amount of magazines, old documents, and cheap jewelry that took six months to clear. After that, Frankie’s mother assumed responsibility for breaking the cycle. This is an act of goddamn love, she would say, endlessly emptying and stripping things away, creating a bizarre skull of a house. Meanwhile, Frankie’s brother existed in a computer world, a lonely spider extending from his thread, down for Pot Noodles and back up into the dark, drinking cans of fluorescent Monster and Irn-Bru. How Frankie could be a part of this family, she could not understand. At some point, her mother got back from wherever she had been and whipped the empty cheese-sandwich plate from beneath Frankie’s chin. Stop sitting on that little arse of yours, she said, and help me shift some old games from the garage. The job at Beach Ices was, from the outside, a tedious one, but Frankie couldn’t help feeling excited to go in every morning. Frankie and Lucia were alone in the shop all day—Ingrid complained aggressively about the cost-of-living crisis and could she really be expected to have more than two workers on the books—and they fell into something of a routine together. In the mornings, Lucia walked over from where she lived with her aunt in the village, and Frankie sped over on her bike through the yellow oilseed-rape fields. While they prepared things for the day, they played the radio extra loud, and Lucia made them giant iced coffees stirred with milk and sugar. Frankie didn’t especially like coffee and the way it made her blood shiver, but she drank it because Lucia did. They don’t make music as good these days, Lucia said one morning. It’s a tragedy. You don’t like any of it? I like some of it. I should have been an ’80s kid. Why? That’s just where I should have been. I’d have been an ’80s dyke. Frankie thought about that. It was true, Lucia did seem like she was from a different time, but not in the way that Frankie felt misplaced. Lucia was other-timely in a deliberate, earthly way, whereas Frankie felt peculiarly like at any moment she might cease to exist on Earth at all, floating up through the ozone holes, far away from the strange luminescent fields and old rock. You seem to know so many things about yourself for sure, Frankie said, sipping on her pint of coffee and stretching her hands across the countertop so they reached the light of the morning sun. I guess so, Lucia said. Got Mimi to thank for that. Mimi? My aunt. Oh, yeah. She adopted me when I was 5. My parents couldn’t hack it or whatever, and Mimi really wanted a kid, but she’s trans, and it was all kinda tricky for her at the time. But anyway, Mimi’s great. She took women’s-studies classes at uni, which is like what gender studies used to be, and she ended up in this super political group, she was at Greenham Common and all of that. Mmm, Frankie said. She didn’t know what Greenham Common was, but it sounded impressive. What’s your family like? Lucia asked. Oh, I don’t know. Not very interesting. That’s just because you know them so well. It occurred to Frankie that Lucia had a way of speaking like everything she said was gospel. I’m not sure that I do know them so well, she said. She thought of the way they all drifted around the house together, and about how Eleanor had told Frankie that her mum gave her the creeps. You should come and meet Mimi sometime, Lucia said. Frankie smiled. Sure, I’d like that. Out of nowhere, Ingrid appeared, snapping her fingers and chewing gum with her mouth wide open. Quit chatting, girls! she said. There’s machines to clean. It was around this time that Frankie noticed a pattern: Lucia had a number of annoying habits, but Frankie didn’t mind them. They were the kinds of things that if, say, her dad had done them, she would have been filled with disgust, like spitting on the floor in the yard out the back, and looking at Frankie like she was a fish in the wrong tank, and speaking in that assured, knowing way. But somehow, when Lucia did them, she still felt pulled toward her; she hungered for her. The whole thing was so bizarre, she thought. She couldn’t put her finger on it. Her mother had always told her that she approached people with too much gusto. Hold back a bit, Frankie, Christ, she would say, nobody wants you to tell them the last page before they’ve even started the book. The phrase had always puzzled her, but she supposed it had to do with the way she loved things. Like the teddy her granny gave her that she cuddled so ferociously that it disintegrated into threads, and the little girl in her preschool with buttermilk hair whom she took such a liking to that the girl’s mum accosted Frankie’s mother in the playground to say the whole business was getting darn weird and could Frankie’s mother please control her daughter. Anyway, the thing about these habits of Lucia’s was that Frankie wanted Lucia to notice things about her as well. She wanted to seem interesting and cool in a queer, unbothered sort of way. She started reading classics like Orlando and watching videos of people analyzing them so she could recycle the same ideas. She stopped sulking under the bean plants in the evenings and instead looked up the artists Lucia spoke of when she moaned about wanting to leave the village and go to art school. And then, after she had saved up a chunk of money from Beach Ices, she took a bus to Portland on her day off to visit the hair-and-nail salon her mother liked. The lights in the salon were neon white, and the women platinum blond and manicured. Frankie felt giddy; she looked at herself in the mirror, framed by raspberry expanding foam, and wondered about her changeability. I want to cut my hair, she said to the hairdresser, looking at the dark nothingy length of it. I’d hope so, the hairdresser said. Good, Frankie said. I want it short. When you say short? Frankie showed the hairdresser a photo she’d found off the internet. The girl had a pixie mullet and an impeccable jawline. While the hairdresser sliced her hair, Frankie listened to the nail-salon staff bicker, and breathed the coconut-and-shea-butter air and imagined how her new self would look next to Lucia. The falling strands encircled her like the tossed fur of a skinned rabbit. God, you remind me of someone I used to know, the younger nail woman said, catching Frankie’s eye as she walked out the door. Is she hot? Frankie said without meaning to. Back at home, her family were all in, lurking about the kitchen. Christ, her mother said when she walked through the door. Oh dear, her father said, and stared at her. Her brother didn’t look up, and said nothing. Well, fuck you all, Frankie thought as she pushed past them, thudding up the stairs and lying flat on her bed. The next day at work, Lucia did a double take when Frankie arrived, stopping whatever she’d been doing before and looking Frankie up and down. Well, shit, she said. You followed through. Uh-huh. Frankie did a small spin. I like it. Lucia’s eyes lingered. Perhaps it was just her new-hair bravado, but after that, Frankie thought, something was different. The hot, salty air was beginning to thicken with the coming rain, and the customers were rude, tired, and sweating but between them, something was tender and changed. On her lunch break, Frankie didn’t sit out in the concrete yard as usual but instead went for a walk along the gray, stony beach, the shrieking kids and dogs fading into a discarded backdrop. Frankie loved the beach. She loved the constant movement of the water and the sticky air, and she loved to see the layers of earthly time squashed up against one another in the Purbeck Monocline. A folding, suffocating, gorgeous grave. She wished that Lucia wasn’t so desperate to leave for bigger places so that they might lie upon the folds and layers together. She scrambled over the bigger rocks to the cliff edge and touched the warm, hard stone. In the mid-afternoon, back at Beach Ices, the rain came closer, crawling and heaving over their heads. Do you smell that? Lucia said, reaching out and holding on to Frankie’s forearm as the first drops began to fall. Uh-huh, Frankie said, the feeling of Lucia’s hand on her skin making her afraid to move. They stood like that, Lucia holding tight, Frankie silent and still, waiting, waiting, waiting, that change in the air, the warmth, the huge expanse of deep-gray sky, and then, like water pushed off a slick, showered body, the rain smashed against the ceiling of their little ice-cream hut. Lucia’s hand squeezed harder, and the smell of the hot, dry ground turned wet, those heavy, sweet earth smells seeping into the air, and Frankie looked over at Lucia, at the way she smiled at the spitting storm, the shrapnel of sideways washes freckling her face, and she wanted to reach out and pull her lips close, to feel the joining of their breath, but she just stood there smiling, looking at the rain and Lucia and how the parched ground became suddenly soupy—thirsting, wettening, drinking. Why don’t you wait it out at mine tonight? Lucia said. Lucia’s house was almost exactly like Frankie had imagined. The colors inside were of somewhere else: oranges, purples, yellows. The walls were lined with books, and the corners were filled with plants. A ’60s cabinet stood where a TV might have been, stacked with old records and a turntable. From the kitchen, Lucia’s aunt Mimi appeared, wiping her hands on a tea towel. Her face was all smiles, her hair short and curly, and she wore big blue dungarees and gold hoops in her ears. This is Frankie from work, Lucia said. Oh, glorious! Mimi said, reaching in to hug Frankie, smelling of spices and citrusy perfume. My friend Rohit’s here for dinner tonight, can we tempt you to join us? An older guy followed from the kitchen. He had kind eyes, a flowing iridescent shirt, and a thin chain around his neck. He nodded and smiled at Frankie and Lucia. I would love that, Frankie said. She stood in her dampened T-shirt and jeans with the crusty apron around her waist looking around at them all, at this world within her world, and she grinned perhaps more than was necessary. Outside, the rain got heavier and harder, and inside, Rohit put on a Nina Simone record and poured them all cold glasses of beer. I’ll give you all things to chop, Mimi said, and handed out vegetables, herbs, fat garlic cloves, and ginger. We’re making a Thai red curry. They cooked and chatted, smells of lemongrass and frying shallots in the air, rain sliding down the glass in the darkening sky. Frankie asked how Mimi and Rohit had met, and they told an elaborate story about a sandwich bar in Istanbul. Is it true? she asked Lucia, and they all laughed in a deep, throaty way. They spoke about Mimi’s work teaching pottery and what to do on Lucia’s 18th at the end of the month and Rohit’s friend Nora whose wife had dementia. Frankie had never heard of a queer person being old enough to have dementia, and she had never heard of lives like this. As they all sat down to eat, she thought of her family. They would not understand a night like this. They would think that it really was just what it was, dinner and a few drinks; they would not understand what a bizarre and delicious thing it all was, to sit here and slurp up hot, spicy broth with lime juice and coconut, to listen to the warm chatter of people who don’t know you but somehow know you better than your own family. She heard words not as meaning but as rhythms, the gentle tune of it. At the end of the night, she was full and happy, her stomach warm, her jaw sore from laughing. As they stacked things into the dishwasher, Lucia pulled Frankie aside and put a hand on her upper arm. Do you wanna stay? she said. It’s still going out there. They looked out at the heavy washes tearing through the sky, lit up by fairy lights and the glow of other houses. Frankie turned back to look at Lucia. Her cheeks were reddened, and her eyes sheened. Okay, she said. Lucia’s room was full of rugs and art positioned in a way that looked both meticulous and chaotic. Frankie hadn’t anticipated how intimate it would feel walking in. Lucia was not just Lucia from work, but someone with a night-light plugged into her wall and used mugs left scattered across the surfaces. I like it, Frankie said, sitting down on the bed, thinking how real Lucia seemed, and how strange it was that she had ever been just a fantasy at all. Lucia pottered about, switching on a lamp, putting things away into cupboards, stacking the mugs into a corner. Frankie almost wanted to say, Hey, stop, I like your mess, I like imagining the way you’ve moved about. If it’s okay with you, Lucia said, plumping the pillows up, half-looking at Frankie, you can just sleep in my bed with me? We don’t have an air bed or anything. Oh, of course, Frankie said. Thank you. Lucia dug around in the drawers and pulled out a big black T-shirt. She tossed it over to Frankie. If you want something to wear to bed, she said. Frankie thanked her and held on to the T-shirt. She wasn’t sure if she was meant to get changed now. In the corner, Lucia turned away and started shrugging off her jeans and putting bed shorts on, and then the same with her T-shirt. Frankie tried not to look, but the sight made something in her open wide, like the gentle movement of the earth for a seed to push through, up through rock. The soft curves of Lucia’s body folded upon themselves as she bent, taking off one T-shirt, pulling on another. Frankie did the same with her own, and they moved like that, turned away from each other, barely breathing. In bed, they lay quietly side by side. I hope tonight was okay for you, Lucia said. It was pretty much my happiest night, Frankie replied. Really? Yeah. Outside, the wind grew angry, while the centimeters between them grew hot and fraught. They looked at each other, Lucia’s warm dark eyes, her flushed cheeks, Frankie’s nervous disposition, her anxious wanting gaze. The feel of Lucia staring filled Frankie with a strange kind of dread, the fear that she might spoil this sweet thing with her hunger, that she had gotten things wrong in an awful, heavy kind of way. She couldn’t bear to keep looking and turned her head back to face the ceiling and the smudged blue tack marks where glow-in-the-dark stars used to be. Goodnight, Frankie, Lucia said softly. Goodnight, Frankie whispered, and then she just lay there in the dark, so alive with the feeling of Lucia’s closeness that she couldn’t sleep. For hours she lay there, afraid to move, listening to the persistent rain, thinking about the old Frankie who hung about the bean plants and got ostracized from group chats, and of the new Frankie who was lying here in Lucia’s bed, in Lucia’s T-shirt, with Lucia right there beside her. What a world it was, she thought, where a summer thunderstorm could suddenly have her on the inside of this house. For so much of her life, she had been watching people join up and pair off, sharing a togetherness that she didn’t belong to. She looked at the shape of Lucia next to her and felt that she knew something real. In the early morning, drifting in and out of an almost-sleep, she began to hear birds outside—the waking seagulls, the house sparrows. The sound of the rain was gone. Beside her, Lucia shuffled about, her breathing light. Are you awake? Frankie whispered, and Lucia rolled over and nodded. Can’t sleep, she said, rubbing her eyes, yawning. I think the storm is over, Frankie said. Oh, yeah? Lucia looked over toward the window. It’s almost sunrise, I think. What would you say, maybe, to going for a walk? I could be persuaded, Lucia said, smiling. They threw on jumpers and jeans from Lucia’s closet and crept from the house. The air was fresh with fallen rain, the sky fading into blue. The beach was deserted except for seabirds and chunks of driftwood. The pebbles were wet and shiny, the cove rippling and pulsing in and out. They walked all the way along the beach and sat beneath the Purbeck Monocline, the stones soaking through them as they looked out toward the sea. So tired and drunk off spending all this time with Lucia, Frankie shuffled up close to her and dropped her head on her shoulder. Lucia rested her head down too, closing a small place of warmth between their necks. Even though I barely slept, Lucia said, I’m happy you stayed over. You didn’t? I was lying there awake too. Goddamnit. Goddamnit? Such a waste. A waste of what? Of time. Lucia lifted her head up, and Frankie did too, turning to look at Lucia. They inhaled and exhaled in trembling time. I am so afraid, Frankie thought, I am so afraid of being wrong, I am so afraid of smothering you, I am so afraid I am so afraid, and then Lucia put a hand on the back of Frankie’s neck, her fingers curling around her nape, and she leaned in to kiss her, her lips soft and alive against Frankie’s, and they kissed like that for long minutes. Their hands found new places of rest and touch, the dizzy energy of their bodies carving an earthy lust in the wet layers of sand and stone. Lucia moved so that she was almost on top of Frankie, scooping an arm underneath her, warming her goose-bumped skin. She was panting and gorgeous, her body above Frankie’s a wide and beautiful darkness obscuring the half-nighted sky, and above them, the Purbeck Monocline, that monstrously beautiful folding of rock, the layers pressing down upon one another, stone limbs and bodies bending and curving into one another, 30 million years old. It’s not enough to touch you, Frankie thought, I want to swallow you, I want you inside of me, and she looked up at Lucia, no longer thinking but desiring, and said, Will you spit in my mouth, will you please spit in my mouth? And Lucia looked back, her nose almost touching Frankie’s, and then she did, the wet pearl of her saliva falling from her lips into Frankie’s, and Frankie lay there and swallowed, this piece of Lucia inside of her mouth, inside of her body. Thank you, she said, and Lucia looked at her strangely. She shuffled so that she was no longer on top of Frankie, and in a moment, Frankie felt both newly made and pricked with dread. Why did you want me to do that? Lucia said. I don’t know. Did you get it from porn? No! Frankie moved slightly, her body in a carved-out indent in the stones. Sorry, Lucia said. She looked straight ahead, away from Frankie and toward the sea. She rubbed her eyes. I’m not judging you, she said. Okay. I just don’t know if I’m ready for this. I’m leaving soon. I know. We work together. I know. Lucia turned around to look at her. Her face was a beautiful thing. In a strange way, Frankie felt that the tides were drawing out, pulling and exposing so that the debris of the ocean floor was lying there in the sun. It’s for the best, right? Lucia said. You’re younger than me. Okay. Lucia stood up, hovering awkwardly above Frankie. I’m gonna walk back, she said. Are you gonna come? I’m gonna stay here. Okay. Lucia stayed looking at her for a moment, and then she turned, the sound of her feet a steady, fading pattern. In the stones, Frankie lay back and looked up at the sky, fat tears sliding from her cheeks and into the earth. As the day opened, the sky turned deep orange and then eventually blue, the tide stretched farther down the shoreline, and the new light bore witness to the wreckage of the storm. At the end of summer, Lucia moved on, finally leaving the village as she had wanted and starting art school in Bournemouth. Ingrid replaced her with a surfer girl, Emily, and strangely enough, Frankie wasn’t sad. She would scroll through the photos of Lucia online, see her new haircuts and friends gathered round her, and instead of moping like the old Frankie might have, the new Frankie just smiled. The new Frankie showed Emily how to run an ice-cream shop; the new Frankie was resident dyke in Lulworth, and lounged across the counter looking bored. And still, sometimes, while she was sitting in the concrete yard eating lunch, or putting on her apron, she thought she heard Lucia singing along to the radio, the memory of it now distant, paling. In those tiny flashes, while Emily chattered beside her, Frankie would think about the way Lucia’s spit had felt sliding down her throat. How Frankie had seemed to grow from Lucia’s body, forming from her spit and DNA, and how their pleasure, for that small August moment, had altered the shape of that perfect pebbled cove, and although the tide had come in and smoothed it all over, Frankie’s body had been made new, jagged and crystalline in the rising sun."

        "story": "“Mr. Phillips?” “Yes. Speaking.” It was 7:30 on a Sunday morning. He was in his dressing gown. But he’d recognized the voice of his son-in-law, Paul, and appreciated the mock formality. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. “Mr. Phillips” was what Paul had studiously called him when they were first introduced by Helen. Another Sunday, not so many years before. “Mr. Phillips … Mrs. Phillips …” all very proper and respectful, and he’d liked it. He and Ruth had been wondering when—if—they might meet “the boy,” as they’d both begun to designate him. Now here he was, on the doorstep beside Helen, with the obligatory bunch of flowers for Ruth and his scrupulous “Mr. Phillips.” He’d liked it, and thought he’d let it run for a while. Wasn’t that how potential fathers-in-law were supposed to treat potential sons-in-law? A leg of lamb was roasting in the oven. Let the boy sweat a bit too. But the boy had turned into Paul. And Helen would turn into Mrs. Heywood. And he, Mr. Phillips, had turned, quickly enough, into Tom. “Call me Tom.” He’d seen Helen’s face relax. And the boy, so it seemed, was also shortly to turn into a barrister. If he’d put him through it, just a little, then in truth he’d been somewhat daunted himself. Jesus Christ, Helen’s going to marry a whiz-kid lawyer. “Mr. Phillips?” “Yes. Speaking …” A calculated pause. He could join in the game. Birds were singing outside. “Yes—Paul—it’s me.” “You have a granddaughter.” On a gray February day almost 20 years later, as his train sped through several English counties, he’d remembered that moment. It seemed like recalling a dream. The phone, his dressing gown, the birds. He’d left Ruth upstairs, still half asleep, or perhaps only pretending to be. For almost 24 hours, they’d been expecting a call. He’d leaped up. “I’ll go. I’ll take it downstairs.” After speaking to Paul, he’d returned, light-footed, to Ruth, who by then was fully awake, eyes wide, and sitting up as if to receive an audience. A Sunday morning in May. They were both not yet 50, mere youngsters themselves. He’d reemployed the formula of their son-in-law. “We have a granddaughter.” Then he’d said, “And she has a name already. Clare.” Now he no longer had Ruth and he no longer had a granddaughter. It was unbearable. And from the moment of his getting up this morning, he’d been haunted by that long-ago figure: himself, disheveled but overjoyed, in his dressing gown. As he’d shaved, he’d been wearing the same dark-blue dressing gown. How many dressing gowns did you need in a life? His train had carried him captively onward, but this was all his choice. Winter scenery had glided by. And how long a life can seem. Yet how quickly 20, 30—50—years can pass. How quickly one scene can overtake another. Now he was walking with a woman young and old enough to be his daughter along a covered pathway on a university campus near a provincial city. He’d never been to either the city or the university, though he’d once been, 50 years ago, at a similar university when parts of the campus were still under confident construction. He wondered whether to mention it to this woman—she was called Gibbs, Sarah Gibbs—in order to remedy scant conversation, in order to hide his apprehension and confusion. It was a difficult walk. Words were failing both of them. Here he was, when it was too late. Everything was too late. Ruth had died six months before. Of “natural causes.” Cancer was a natural cause, though “natural” was an easy word. And six months was nothing, it was still yesterday. And he’d thought that that was cruel? Could you die of unnatural, inexplicable causes? Yes, now he knew you could. It had been a consolation—another easy word—that Ruth, at least, had never had to know the loss of their granddaughter. The double cruelty was his alone. Though Clare had known the loss of her grandmother. Had that even been a reason? They had been close, Ruth and Clare. What’s more, it was often noted, from the first moments of Clare’s being “shown” by her parents—he’d thought of that day when Paul had been “shown” by Helen—that Clare had Ruth’s looks. Their closeness was prefigured by resemblance. Clare had her grandmother’s eyes, her mouth, her way of tilting her chin; you couldn’t deny it. It was all rather wonderful. He had been seeing his wife as a baby. Might he say something of all this to this woman? “Clare was very close, you know, to her grandmother. That is, to my wife …” Was that a good tack? Or was it better—or more crass—to say, “I was at a university myself, you know, just like this one. I studied modern history …”? And feebly joke, “Now I’m part of it.” Why hadn’t this woman—Mrs. Gibbs? Dr. Gibbs?—put on a coat? It was February. She’d said, “It’s no distance.” It was already feeling like half a mile. The resemblance had been unmissable. He might put it differently and say that Clare had been as beautiful as her grandmother. They shared their beauty. He wished he’d said it when they were both alive. Might he say it now to this woman? But Clare’s grandmother had died. Just when Clare was leaving school, when she’d gained a place at university and was turning 18, just when she was deserving of blessings and congratulations—not least from her grandmother—her grandmother had stolen her thunder and died. A reason? A trigger? If only her grandmother hadn’t died. Well, yes. He said it constantly to himself. If only Ruth, his wife, Ruth, Clare’s grandmother, hadn’t died. And sometimes he even said—unreasonably and harshly: If only Clare hadn’t stolen his grief. Cold gusts blew around the pathway. The canopy above them rattled and tinkled. He was in the coat he’d arrived in. This woman must be suffering, in just her white blouse and black cardigan. She must have thought, back in her office, that it would be somehow unseemly, under the solemn circumstances, to go through the petty business of fetching her coat and putting it on. He had said—it was common decency—“It’s chilly out there. Aren’t you going to put on a coat?” He hadn’t thought this visit would involve such niceties. But no. It was “no distance.” Or perhaps she’d thought that she should appear penitent. Though was it her fault? He hadn’t said it was anyone’s fault. He hadn’t come here to blame. Though he hadn’t come here, either, to console. Poor woman, she must have been going through it. A black cardigan, a black skirt. To offer a token touch of the funereal? A black skirt that hugged her hips. Was it for him to notice? “Mrs. Gibbs?” Another phone call. “Yes. This is—Mrs. Gibbs speaking.” He hadn’t known whether to call her “Mrs. Gibbs” or “Dr. Gibbs” or even, possibly, “Dean Gibbs.” She was, apparently, a dean. “This is Mr. Phillips.” He might have said “Tom Phillips,” but didn’t. “I’m Clare Heywood’s grandfather. I mean, I was her grandfather.” “Ah.” He’d heard the tremor of exasperation. Yes, he could well imagine the tough time of it this woman has been having. Not only imagine; he knew it, from Helen and Paul. Sarah Gibbs was their “liaison” with the university. Perhaps she’d thought that after three weeks she’d almost weathered it. Now here was an agitated grandfather. He’d heard the exhaustion in her voice. But three weeks was nothing. How long did you—could you—give such a thing? He’d been told, many times, well-meaningly, that he’d “get used” to Ruth’s death, or, more subtly, that he’d “get used to not getting used to it.” Well, six months had passed and he hadn’t gotten used to anything. Six months was nothing. And how did you ever get used to this? “Mr. Phillips—please, would you accept my deepest condolences.” A fair start. It had even been said with a sort of gentleness. Then he said, “There’s something I’d like to discuss.” And he thought he’d heard an intake of breath. Yes, she might have had enough “discussion.” Enough fielding, in its various forms, the relentless question “Why?” He’d had to steel himself to make this call—to get put through. Now he sensed a steeliness on her part. Perhaps she was really some horn-rimmed harridan. “No, I don’t mean ‘discuss.’ There’s something I’d like to do.” Less than a week later, on this gray day, he’d found himself in her office. His “request” had been granted. Could it be refused? A date had been agreed on. He’d taken a train. A taxi from the station. He’d been directed to the appropriate administrative block. He was still steeled, still prepared for some harridan. But— She was beautiful. He hadn’t expected it. He hadn’t expected to be confronted with beauty. Yet he’d at once thought: Jesus Christ, she’s beautiful. Some inner voice that he thought he’d lost years ago had said it, even in such brazen language. And he was at once bewildered. Doubly bewildered. He was bewildered anyway. It seemed that he’d entered long ago a permanent state of bewilderment. Life had become bewilderment. She’d stood up, behind her desk. “Mr. Phillips, I’m Sarah Gibbs.” Forty-four? Forty-five? The same age as Helen, a little older. Might that have helped Helen in their “discussions”? Could anything have helped Helen? Or Paul? Forty-five? Forty-six? And, probably, a mother too, perhaps with a daughter of her own, around Clare’s age. Why had he immediately thought: daughter? But, in any case, young and old enough to be his own daughter. And beautiful. She came forward, extending a hand. A black cardigan over a white blouse. A black skirt. What did she make of his own choice: a suit and tie, visible beneath the unbuttoned coat that he seemed uneager to remove? A stern let’s-get-on-with-it look about him. And yet—could she see it?—he’d been stopped in his tracks. “Please call me Sarah.” Had he said, “I’m Tom”? Bewilderment. The words Mrs. Gibbs or Dr. Gibbs, let alone Dean Gibbs, didn’t go with the word beautiful. If beautiful, in this context, was even a legitimate word. He hadn’t found any other woman beautiful since Ruth died. He hadn’t thought it possible, permissible. Now it was happening, now of all times. “Please, Mr. Phillips, won’t you sit down?” He hadn’t wanted to sit down. Sitting down led to “discussion,” to not getting on with it. But he sat, without taking off his coat. A compromise. She hadn’t said, after all, “Won’t you take off your coat?” When she sat too, at her desk again, he noticed, inside the collar of her blouse, a single string of pearls. He felt a stab, an unwarranted but undeniable stab. She might have seen his eyes glisten. A present from a husband, for some special occasion. She belonged still to that world in which husbands gave presents to their wives, a world of pearl necklaces. The world he no longer inhabited. Now she walked beside him, her hand sometimes seeking her throat, as if to coax from it unobtainable words, or to tell herself that, instead of a pearl necklace, she might at least have worn a scarf. He’d declined, perhaps too briskly, the inevitable offer of a coffee or tea, but seen the flicker of relief in her face. No sitting around for five minutes, clinking cups. She, too, perhaps, wished to get on with it. Or get it over with. The face had, yes, its signs of strain, but this didn’t stop it having its principal effect. He was actually afraid that if they lingered for any length of time, looking at each other across her desk, she must see in his own face the awkward fact that he was attracted to her. Attractive. A better—safer—word than beautiful ? It was almost neutral. But it wasn’t the first word that had come into his head. And what did this—business—between them have to do with safety? It was too late for safety. Though she was apparently a dean, charged not with the academic needs of students but with their general welfare. Their safety. Hadn’t she failed, catastrophically? But he hadn’t come here to blame. Though perhaps she thought he had—sitting there, in his coat, like some impatient inspector. Did she find him frightening? While he found her beautiful. The pearls had trembled as she spoke. “You must realize, Mr. Phillips, that Clare’s room has now been cleared.” It was good that she called it “Clare’s room,” but there was the little collision of “Clare” and “clear.” They were the same word. Had she noticed and regretted it? And cleared was itself a strange expression. But, yes, he’d “realized.” He’d known from Helen and Paul. It was, anyway, a reasonable assumption. He hadn’t been expecting, after more than three weeks, a room that would be “just as she left it.” A room full of things. Full of Clare. That would have been unbearable. “Everything that belonged to her has been—taken by her parents. It’s just, I’m afraid, a bare room. We are keeping it empty and locked as a—mark of respect.” He’d thought, but not said: For how long? Long enough for this visit of his? How long would be appropriate? He’d thought: Poor students who had the rooms on either side, who shared the corridor. Poor student who, one day, whenever the period of respect was over, might get allocated the same room. He said, “I understand. But even so.” Meaning: Even so, I’d still like to go there. Had she been thinking that at the last minute he’d reconsider? Was she worried that she might not get through this little exercise herself? Might he have to hold her hand? Was she frightened of him? “Well, then.” She got to her feet again, but paused, her fingertips pressing her desk. “If you’re sure.” “Quite sure. It’s why I’m here.” He tried to smile. She took from among the things on her desk a set of keys. But, for whatever self-punishing reason, disdained a coat. And now they were walking along a covered but exposed pathway and she must be frozen, but he couldn’t bring himself to offer her his own coat. Part of him, in fact, longed to offer it, to be in circumstances where he might not only offer it, but take the opportunity to nestle it around her. But these were not those circumstances. He was shivering too, even in his coat. These were circumstances that, in any weather, might have caused shivers. “No distance”? Hadn’t she learned the dimensions of her own university? They walked along pathways, between buildings and wintry lawns, across paved spaces that seemed to have been recently equipped with brightly colored, screwed-down metal benches and tables, though the paving itself, he noticed, was blackened and puddled. The buildings, too, which must once have been modern and “contemporary,” had streaks and stains on their brickwork. And as they walked together, he was aware of their togetherness in a way that, though he’d imagined that there might be such a walk, he’d not foreseen he would peculiarly appreciate. Attracted, attractive. The safer words? He was having feelings about her, and it was shocking, shaming, bewildering that he was having such feelings when engaged in such a purpose. And when, anyway, for God’s sake, he was old. He’d recognized it, accepted it. He was 68. He’d not recognized it when Ruth died. He’d been 67, Ruth 66. He’d felt then, even with gushes of anger: I’m too young for this, too young. Ruth had certainly been too young. But, after this other terrible thing, he’d become old. Sixty-eight? That’s not old, they might say, not these days; it’s nothing. But he recognized it. There are things that age you. He was an old man, even a ridiculous and grotesque old man, walking beside this woman young enough to be his daughter, and having feelings about her. He was in his suit and tie and coat, but he might as well have still been wearing the dressing gown he’d worn this morning. A permanent, flapping old man’s dressing gown, the February wind now and then revealing his bare, blue old man’s knees. And around him were young people. Of course there were. It was a university. They flitted around like so many ghosts, using the paths, going in and out of buildings, crossing the paved spaces with the playground furniture. Some of them nodded, even smiled at Mrs. Gibbs, a little sheepishly, he thought. And what on earth did they make of him? He was an old man among ghostly young people, and must look like a ghost to them. Or perhaps like a man who had seen a ghost. Or was going to see one. They hardly spoke. It was a silencing walk. He felt the onus was on him to gallantly dispel the silence, but he lacked the means. What topic was appropriate? And there was no question of their batting between them the word that yet surely hung over them and that had hung over everything for more than three weeks: Why? No one had the answer. Clare herself had left no explanation. No note. There was nothing she’d said to any friend—or family member—to be recalled, even with hindsight, as ominous. Why? It started and at once stopped conversations. But it was the only word that mattered. He’d not pushed it forward in his dreadful conversations—if conversations was even the right word—with Helen and Paul. He wasn’t going to thrust at them a word for which, though they must have ceaselessly struggled to find it, they clearly had no answer. Paul was now an experienced legal counsel, no doubt used to sharply getting to a point, but he was as beyond words as Helen. And as for “counsel.” They walked. His heart was thumping at what lay ahead. At the same time his blood was tingling, outrageously, at something else. It was being warmed by this woman—who must be freezing—at his side. Was it all a monstrous conflation? It was Clare who’d been beautiful, Clare who’d taken after Ruth and been beautiful and young and had so many other things going for her. But who’d deliberately and meticulously over a sufficient period of time stored up some pills and then killed herself in the room that he was about to be shown. They turned, at last, into one of the residential blocks. This must be the one. They went up two flights of stairs. A corridor. The doors to rooms, perhaps seven or eight on either side. He had the dreamlike illusion that Mrs. Gibbs, with her set of keys, was taking him to his room, to where it would be his lot to be staying, some strange, uncategorizable guest. After she’d unlocked the door and shown him the room, she would hand him the key. And now they were outside it. “Clare’s room.” It was just a door. There was no special sign, least of all an indelible Clare Heywood. Just a number: 16. Between 15 and 17. She unlocked the door and stepped back, to let him enter first. A bare rectangular room, quite small. A few fittings. A folding flap of a desk. A window with a view, a pleasant-enough view of trees—now all bare too—and sloping lawns. Paths. Another of those paved spaces with the colorful apparatus. Her last view. But it had happened, of course, at night. A bed, also bare, just a mattress. A single bed. But he knew from his own direct, if ancient, experience, which he had no wish to invoke in detail, how these single rooms and single beds might become intimately shared. He stood in the room. It was all impossibly cruel. It was like some neat, comfortable, yet punitive cell. Surely not a condemned one. Why? Mrs. Gibbs said, behind him, “Would you like, perhaps—some time to yourself? Would you like me to wait along the corridor?” “No. It’s all right.” He was glad of her hovering presence. And, even now, of the tingle. Did she feel it? Was it, conceivably, a mutual thing? He felt in any case that she, too, preferred not to be left alone—standing at the end of the corridor, clasping her arms around herself and wondering how long he might need. While she stood at his shoulder, he scanned the room. Was there, in a corner, some clue, an overlooked clue, some hint that only a grandfather might discern? But it didn’t take long to take in everything—and nothing. It was all he could do, all he could have done. It didn’t even look like “her,” or anyone’s, room. He’d never come here when she and all her things had been in it. He’d never visited, proudly, when she was a new university student, 18 years old, with her life before her. She’d been born—that Sunday-morning call had come—in the momentous year 2000. What did they think, those flitting ghosts, about their future? He, her grandfather, had been born in the not unresonant year 1950. And had outlived his granddaughter. Would it have made any difference if he’d visited? Surely it would have been the last thing she’d have wanted, a grandfather turning up to embarrass her before her newfound friends. And in any case, her bereaved grandfather, with his smell of age and grief. But he was here now, with his even stronger smell, the bare trees outside peering in at him like so many assembled witnesses. After a while he turned and said, “Okay, that’s enough.” Mrs. Gibbs was standing closer than he’d thought. He said, “I’m glad I came.” A clumsy statement. But, truly, he was. Even if glad was a preposterous word. She let him out, then relocked the door. It was as though he’d said, “No, I won’t take it, I won’t take this room.” He thought that she might have been prepared for him to have some kind of convulsion, to weep. Prepared, even, to put an arm around him. But no, it hadn’t been needed. At least he’d spared her that, and sacrificed, for himself, the chance to receive from her some faltering, pitying—soft, womanly—embrace. If Clare had been a ghost, haunting her room, what would she have thought to behold such a thing? Around them again, as they walked back, flitted all those other ghosts. And as they walked back, they walked, once more, mostly in silence. But this time he said it. It seemed it would have been heartless not to. “It’s really freezing. Won’t you have my coat?” And—for whatever reason—she declined, with a little determined shake of her head. “It’s all right.” Though she’d clearly been trembling. He thought, then, that she might burst into tears. That she might be the one, in her role of dean, of guardian, of faintly maternal protectress, to suddenly break down. And require comforting. And again, as they walked, what small talk was there? Oh yes, I was at university myself once. It was where I met my wife … In her office, as he made his final departure and they shook hands, he said once more, “I’m glad I came. Thank you, Mrs. Gibbs. Thank you very much for your trouble.” But he didn’t, even at this point, call her “Sarah” or give her hand some extra affectionate squeeze. And the strange thing was that, even as she’d relocked that door, even as he’d offered her his coat, his extraordinary rush of feeling for her—his attraction, his perplexity before her beauty—began to fade. It seemed itself like some departing ghost. Was she beautiful? Or had he in some unaccountable way gifted beauty upon her? When he said goodbye, he said something else. He said that his daughter and son-in-law, Helen and Paul, Clare’s parents, didn’t know about this visit of his; he’d not mentioned it to them. And he asked Mrs. Gibbs if—were she to have any further dealings with Helen and Paul—she might not mention it either. He asked if they might keep this visit of his “between themselves.” And that’s just what it had been—more than he’d supposed. Between themselves. She had blinked a bit. Out of surprise, or out of a sense of complicity. Or she’d just blinked. And yes, when she’d blinked he’d thought that her dark-brown eyes were beautiful. She said, “I won’t say anything.” But she didn’t ask why. She just said, “I understand.” “I understand.” The words, too, were like a ghost. Nobody understood anything. On his train back, he wondered if Mrs. Gibbs would remember him: the man, the grandfather—Mr. Phillips— who came to look at just an empty room. Or was she already forgetting him, putting him away, with relief perhaps, in some file for unclassifiable items? Outside his window, the February sky darkened. The scudding fields and trees became obscure, until he could see nothing of them beyond his own reflection seemingly keeping him company in the dark."

        "year": "2024",
        "story": "After my divorce was finalized, I quit my job. I quit my book club. My monthly poker game. I canceled my gym membership and my weekly tennis lesson. I deleted my social-media accounts. I left every group text. It’s easier this way. Now I work from home—an apartment, actually. I’m a freelance copywriter. I microwave nearly all of my meals, and each evening after dinner, I scoop ice cream into a fussy teacup that I got at a consignment shop. I eat it while my TV plays something from one of the various streaming platforms. I watch until I hear the mockingbird’s call. From some unknown tree outside my window, he pleads for me to go to bed. I comply. In my bedroom, I don’t read. I don’t dream. I wake without an alarm, in the dark, before the sun. I don’t even drink coffee anymore. When I get lonely, I call my divorce lawyer. She always has answers to my questions. “Hello, Min Epstein.” “Hello to you, my friend.” “We’re friends?” “If we aren’t, this call will cost you approximately $300.” We both laugh. “I’m headed back from my mom’s party now,” Min Epstein says, and I wonder what that’s like. I haven’t talked to my parents since the divorce. Instead, I ask her if she has any tattoos. She says, “Objection, relevance,” but she eventually says she doesn’t have any, which is what I expected. I hang up a few minutes later, feeling, as always, less alone. In the silence that follows our call, I practice slowing my breath. Any minute now, the mockingbird will trill at me to go to bed. Is it the same bird every night or different ones? I read that they’re male birds luring mates with their fraudulent calls. Like all men. I stand from my consignment couch, stretching, when a knock sounds at the door. I freeze, unsure what to do. No one aside from random delivery guys has ever knocked on my door, not even Min Epstein. I pay my rent via electronic check to a faceless management company, and I don’t have any of my old friends. It’s nearly 10 in the evening. There’s a second knock. “Hello?” I call out, tiptoeing toward the door. “Hello,” someone—a woman—replies. I open the door a crack, and in that sliver of space I see my upstairs neighbor, Katie or Karla or something. Occasionally, I hear her boyfriend through my ceiling: Katie/Karla, your tea is ready. Next to their front door hangs a heavy wind chime that goes ballistic during the Santa Anas. I can hear it above us now, already cranky. I open the door wider. She stands there in sweats and an old T-shirt, flip-flops, her toes painted red as a lunar-new-year envelope. Even this outfit can’t camouflage her youth and beauty. How long before her average-looking boyfriend tires of her perfection and mangles her heart? She says, “I told Pablo you’d be up!” “I am,” I say. “I’m Katie,” she says. “From Unit Four?” “Simone. Do you need something?” “Well, I—I had to tell you.” Suddenly, Katie is nervous. No one has had news for me since Frank— “The strangest thing happened today,” she continues. “I saw your … do you have a twin?” “A twin? Nope.” “Oh, well, duh, she said she didn’t either.” Katie grins. “I found your long-lost twin! Hashtag doppelgänger!” She rolls her eyes at her own stupid joke. “I’m telling you, she had your exact hair and the same brown eyes. The same face! Like, she had your big nose.” She blushes. “Sorry—I didn’t mean it in a bad way! I love your nose.” “Thanks. I know it’s big.” “Suits your face.” “Where did you see her?” “That coffee bar on Fig. The one with the Spanish tiles.” I pretend I know which one she means. “She works there?” I ask. Katie explains that my twin was camped out at one of the tables, on her computer. Katie thought she was me, so they talked. The woman goes there a lot to work. She loves their cappuccinos. Katie didn’t get her name and didn’t know mine until now. I absorb all of this information with a polite smile. As I close the door, Katie’s walking backwards and saying, “Go meet her! She says she’s there a lot. She didn’t believe me about you.” The wind chime is loud now. Not as loud as the mockingbird though. There he is. Min Epstein shepherded me through my divorce five years prior. It was painless from a legal perspective: Frank and I don’t have children; he bought me out of the house with his dead mother’s money. Since then I’ve lived in relative comfort. Frank and I no longer speak. We have no reason to. From a nonlegal perspective, however, it was, as Min Epstein says, thorny. At first, there was nothing but pain, bottomless pain, my life a shipwreck and I its ragged, nearly drowned sailor, full of shame and anger. In that state, I cut and burned everything and everyone around me until I decided to recede altogether. My life, which is really more of a half life, a laptop set to sleep mode, is simpler this way. Riskless. In this new life, only Min Epstein knows about my dead marriage. Unlike everyone else, my lawyer was deft with my pain; she expected it. She was certainly unruffled by it. Because I stopped talking to my parents after what happened with Frank, I welcomed Min’s tender practicality, a mother and father rolled into one formidable divorce attorney. Whenever I call, she picks up. I call her the next day. “Min Epstein,” she says into the phone. “Min Epstein, Minnie Mouse,” I begin. “I promise not to call you so much after this.” I imagine Min Epstein in her black blazer, her black Gucci loafers with the gold horse bits shined to a buff, her black hair pulled into a neat chignon. She’s behind the wheel of her gleaming black Tesla, its console screen imparting essential information as she blasts her way down La Cienega like the sleekest astronaut. Does traffic even exist for someone like Min Epstein? She is my age, 42. She calls herself child-free, whereas I say my dreams of children were crushed when my marriage collapsed. A matter of semantics, as Min Epstein says. “Everything all right?” she asks. “Guess where I’m going after I hang up?” “You’re going somewhere?” “Do I detect alarm in your voice?” I’m walking through my house looking for my purse. I haven’t used it since I don’t know when. “No—I,” Min stutters. “It’s … unprecedented.” I tell her about Katie and my twin. “She said we have the same big nose!” I expect her to laugh, but Min Epstein is quiet for so long that I wonder if I’ve lost her to outer space. “You still there?” I ask. I catch sight of my purse under my desk and grab it. I blow on it and a body of dust rises in a gray cloud. A second purse. “Be careful,” Min Epstein says. Walking toward the block of potential coffee shops, I feel like I’ve been zapped by electricity, as if dry winter static is sizzling through my body. This puny field trip shouldn’t be a big deal, but it is. I’m going to drink a cappuccino in public even though I gave up coffee years ago and I never go out. Not after Frank—and it’s all because of Frank. After what he did, I didn’t want to be awake anymore—didn’t want, didn’t need, to be in the world. It was all too much; so painful, it was dangerous. The pain would kill me. Last night’s windstorm has left palm fronds scattered across the sidewalks, and as I step around the detritus, I tell myself I’ll be okay. It’s only a cappuccino, and if I see that woman, my supposed twin, so what? She probably doesn’t look that much like me, and even if she does, I’m not sure I’ll notice. If I barely look at myself in the mirror, will I recognize my face on another? I tell myself that none of this—the cappuccino, this so-called twin—matters. But it does. I’m walking quickly. I’m humming. I smile at a woman who’s got her baby strapped to her chest and again at a gardener wielding his leaf blower. I realize what I’m feeling. It’s hope. I used to have this feeling all the time. Hard to believe, but it’s true. I met Frank and when we were together, the glass was half full—of nice champagne. When Frank and I married at an overpriced event space, with its high ceilings and view of downtown L.A., with its crushed-velvet couches in shades of mustard and emerald, we laughed at how long we’d be paying for this single evening. It all cost so much, and we were happy to pay for it. We gladly paid for the letterpress invitations, for my handmade lace dress and his designer suit, for the brass band we’d hired for the cocktail hour, for the muddled mint and top-shelf gin in those cocktails, for the plates of ahi-tuna bites offered alongside them, for the team of professional photographers haunting us like ghosts. On one of those couches (a shade of dusty rose), Frank kissed me on the neck and my body tingled in reply. A photographer’s camera flashed, and I thought my whole life would feel like this. That it would feel good. My cup—my glass—runneth over. Turns out, I’d pay for my marriage to Frank for a very long time, possibly forever, and not with money. He was a public-school teacher. High-school English. He was beloved, the kind of teacher who jumped on a desk to act out a scene from Hamlet, who made everyone laugh, who cursed in class and had a desk drawer full of Starbursts that he tossed across the room to anyone who made a perspicacious insight. His high standards only made students work hard to surpass them: Their essays won awards, and his students got into UCLA, Berkeley, Yale. He supported the kids during walkouts, signed their petitions. Kids enrolled in the school to take him, and they cried to the guidance counselor when they couldn’t get into his class. He won Teacher of the Year six months before we married. He was 32. I made the money, and he got home early enough to make dinner. He graded while the chili was on. He named his sourdough starter Joseph, as in Conrad. On weekends Frank would grade and lesson-plan, and I would exercise and clean the house and go to the farmers’ market, and then we’d go eat an expensive meal, sometimes with friends but usually only us, sucking up oysters in ecstasy, our country of two. Frank and I decided we would have a baby after I got promoted at the ad agency. I was almost 35. I had my eggs checked, and the doctor assured me there were still plenty waiting to be conscripted. We had a terrific sex life. I must say that. It’s what everyone wondered when the news came out. Sure, sometimes our sex was practical, a bodily need that had to be satisfied, but usually it was fun, sometimes romantic. Once in a while, it was transcendent, as if our bodies had left the earthly plane to rise together in heavenly lust. I know Frank experienced it along with me because I saw his face when he came. “I believe you,” Min Epstein told me when I described all of this to her, which was the greatest kindness because no one else did. No one believed my version of our marriage after it ended. My mother said, “You made too much money. I knew that would be a problem.” My father said, “Are you sure you can’t get over this?” One friend said, the last time we spoke, “I always thought it was too good to be true.” When Frank got the call from Joanna, the principal, he didn’t tell me. Only after he’d discussed it with his union rep and then with Reggie, the history teacher across the hall, and after he was officially put on leave and litigation ground into gear, did he say a thing. “I was miserable,” he explained, weakly, over my screams. That a man who seemed to delight in my mind and my company, in my jokes, in my body, could have an affair with a 15-year-old student named Lulu, a girl with an eyebrow ring and a poetry zine, rearranged everything I understood about my life. The glass of champagne? It tipped over. Shattered, really. The coffee shop is the second one I peer into. Katie was correct: Blue and gray Spanish tiles line the floor of the long, rectangular space, and their beauty makes me want to throw money at the barista behind the mirrored counter. Which I do. My voice is husky as I order a cappuccino with whole milk. I feel unreal. I carry my drink to one of the tables near the back. People congregate at the front windows, and aside from one group having what appears to be a production meeting, everyone else is solo, staring into their phones or laptops. Books have gone extinct apparently. I sit and drink my coffee primly and look around. No one here resembles me, not remotely. I’m startled by my own disappointment and I feel like crying, which I haven’t done since the divorce. I remember why I stopped hoping. The lawsuit alleged that, at first, Frank lent Lulu books in an attempt to groom her. It alleged that things turned romantic. It alleged that they met at a motel off National just west of the school. That he took her virginity. It alleged that the affair lasted nine months. The allegations, Frank admitted, were true. “Except the grooming part,” he whimpered. “I didn’t groom her! I was lending her things I thought she would like.” Frank told me he was in love with Lulu. He was in love with her even after she and her mother sued the district, and him, and he was fired. He loved the girl and she did not love him back. I finish my coffee, and as the long-forgotten caffeine high takes over like a baby’s rattle shaking in my blood, I head to the back door. I’ve seen a few people exit that way with their drinks and pastries in hand. I want to see what’s out there. It’s a patio that borders a public parking lot. The space is larger than I expect, with rows of charming picnic tables, a couple of dumpsters counterbalanced by a wall of bougainvillea, and people without laptops. They’re talking, laughing. Two friends clink their mugs like wine glasses. I feel the hope again, soaring, soaring. Maybe it’s the caffeine. Lulu is now in college at USC. What happened with Frank was a long time ago for her. A whole lifetime ago—at least for someone that young. A redheaded man laughs uproariously, leaning back from his picnic bench, and I see her. My twin. She’s the only person sitting alone, writing in a notebook with her shoulders hunched. My shoulders. My thick curtain of brown hair. In profile I make out my own nose—beak-like. My twin pauses in her writing and looks up. I inhale sharply, but she’s staring into the middle distance, squinting as I do, her eyebrows furrowing, her wrinkles deepening, as mine do. She hasn’t seen me yet and so I’m free to take her in. Her face is my face. In her hand is a Parker T-Ball Jotter. My pen. It’s my hand holding my pen. My hope turns into something like panic. I happened to do genetic testing right before Frank’s news, so I know there aren’t any surprise siblings in the ether. But maybe she wasn’t in the system yet. But it can’t be. I’ve seen photos of my own birth. My father was there, my aunt. I’ve seen the birth certificate. No way I have a secret twin. This isn’t a soap opera. I step behind one of the nearby dumpsters so that I won’t be seen and I watch her. My twin bends over her notebook, writing again. It’s how I used to work, when I had a big client and I wanted to brainstorm; I needed ink and the cramping hand for inspiration. What is she writing? Is she … me? Hashtag doppelgänger, I think. No, obviously not, that’s impossible. But she looks exactly like me. My twin glances suddenly from her notebook and peers across the patio in my direction. It’s as if some string exists between us and I’ve given it a tug. But her eyes are glassy and unfocused, she’s deep in thought, and she doesn’t see me. A great wind picks up and the sunshade stretched above the picnic tables lifts in a parabola. A pile of leaves whirls across the concrete. The wind gets stronger, with loud, rackety gusts, and the café patrons exclaim and cry out, squinting to keep the dust from flying into their eyes. The tiny brown napkins take off from the table, and the cups tremble in their saucers. The dumpster rattles in the wind and my twin is holding her notebook down with flat hands to keep the pages from flipping. In the chaos, she stands and shoves the notebook in a smallish purse that I’ve always coveted, from a boutique I used to frequent. My twin is my height. She has my broad shoulders, my waist-to-hip ratio, my thighs, my butt, my feet. My twin is busing her table. My twin is leaving. I must follow her. She heads into the nearby parking lot, and I know that my plan will soon be foiled because she drove here and I did not. I need to confront her, and now. I am about to. I’ll say, “Wow, my neighbor was right! Look at us!” But then she pulls out her keys and hits a button. The car that beeps in reply is a cherry-red Honda Civic. The license plate reads KURTZ. Frank’s car. In the months following the reveal of the affair, I obsessed about Lulu. I wanted to understand why Frank fell for her. She was a child, for God’s sake, 15 years old, in his freshman honors class, a girl addicted to her phone and designing her future tattoo like any teenage girl these days. What was it about his own, middle-aged life, about his life with me, that made him seek her out? She offered him something I couldn’t. I grilled anyone I could about Lulu. I asked Reggie, and our mutual friend Shelly, who taught journalism in the room next to Frank’s, to give me details. I pored over the court filings, trawled the news stories. It was never enough. Lulu was short for Lupe, which was short for Guadalupe. Her parents were from El Salvador. Her dad died when she was little. Her brother was a heroin addict who regularly came to detox at their downtrodden apartment complex on Overland, only to start using again a few months later and steal anything he could to pay for his habit. Lulu didn’t like staying in the apartment with her mom and often crashed with one friend or another. Lulu was by all accounts a talented writer and student, but she lacked confidence and didn’t have the family support that other teens her age had—that they need. She was just the kind of girl to take to a charming, sensitive English teacher, an older man who was funny and kind, and who believed in her, who took her seriously. Frank wanted to believe that their affair was pure, that it existed beyond the power structures of older man and younger woman, teacher and student, white guy and brown girl. Predator and prey. I forced him to show me a photo of her. He claimed he had only one: In it, she is laughing, open-mouthed, vulnerable as a baby bird. Lulu is under five feet tall, with dark hair. I asked Frank again and again what her body was like, and when he told me, I threw my glass of bourbon at him. It burst against the wall into a thousand glittering pieces, and still I couldn’t get his words out of my head. He shouldn’t have answered me. Lulu was a girl, whereas I was a woman. She had many more eggs shelved inside her uterus, and she was like a piece of Silly Putty, molded by Frank’s deft hands. Lulu hadn’t read the books Frank referenced, and until their affair, she’d never heard of the Pixies or a movie called Breathless. Until Frank, she had never let a man— She was young and impressionable. He made an impression. Until he didn’t. Lulu broke his heart, is what he told me. And now he and I are divorced because of what happened between him and Lulu. An irrevocable severance. Only now Lulu’s gone, just a name in court documents, and he’s with a woman who looks identical to me. And she’s driving his car. That would imply a close relationship, wouldn’t it? I walk home, shuttling between fury and confusion. The caffeine has worn off, leaving a headache and that jittery, powerless feeling. I push myself into my apartment and go straight for the phone. “Min Epstein, you won’t believe what I saw.” “Tell me.” Her tone sounds studied, careful. I describe my twin on the patio, how she looks so much like me. I describe the wind. “You must be kidding. I’d kill for a breeze,” she says. “It feels so … heavy and chalky out.” I tell Min Epstein I followed my twin. “You followed her?” she asks, and that same note of alarm that I noticed in our previous conversation resurfaces. “I wanted to,” I say. And then I describe her car. “It was Frank’s Honda,” I say. She says nothing, but I hear someone else’s voice on her end. “Court?” I ask. “Mediation,” she says. “It resumes in a minute. But listen, Simone. I want you to stay put.” “Where would I go?” “You went to the café, didn’t you?” “Well, I—” “Doesn’t matter. What matters is that you remain in your apartment.” “Why?” “I’ll explain later.” She pauses, and the next words out of her mouth are soaked with fear. “Please. Stay there.” I hear some rustling. “I’ll call you back,” she says and hangs up. I sit there on the couch, the phone in my hand as useless as a potato now that Min Epstein’s no longer on the other end. Just then, the mockingbird begins its song. This early in the day? The bird’s call, its shameful fraudulence, makes me think of my twin. How she has my face, my body. Or I have hers. She has my old life. The phone starts in on its hang-me-up nag and I stand. Of course I’m not going to stay here. I live 15 minutes from the old neighborhood and yet it’s a world away, with its traffic and its multimillion-dollar homes, its sparkling reservoir. Years ago, the gays and the artists began the area’s gentrification, and by the time we arrived, it was just barely affordable. Today, scores of rich bachelors and affluent families have hoovered up the remaining real estate, so that it is and isn’t the neighborhood that made it so sought-after in the first place. It seems like the only businesses that can afford the rents along the main shopping artery are high-end chains, and the newer restaurants are a developer’s idea of a cool restaurant, an uncanny valley of a restaurant. I know not to be smug: My current neighborhood will look like this within a decade. I’m driving Katie’s car because I no longer possess one. I knocked on her door and said it was an emergency. She tossed me her keys without question. I’m going to cruise by the old house. See if the Honda’s in the driveway, see if there are other clues to Frank’s new life with this new woman. It’s the sensible plan. I turn onto our street, my heart squawking like a bird in my chest. Katie’s car is a vintage Benz, a diesel, and its engine chugs loudly. I want to turn around and wait for Min Epstein. I planned to drive by slowly, but the car is so loud and the street is so quiet that I’m afraid the engine will tell on me. But, also, something in me feels fierce and fanged. I pull over in front of a duplex and get out, looking around to see if anyone I know is outside. That’s when I hear someone calling my name. I look up. Frank is standing a few houses down—in front of our house. His house. He’s got his gardening Crocs on and the head of a succulent hangs in his hands, its roots like pink threads. “Frank,” I say softly. I’m walking toward him. When he is only a few feet away, I stop to take in all the ways he’s changed. He’s maybe a few pounds heavier, a little more suntanned than usual. His hair is the same, but he has new glasses, light-blue frames instead of the staid tortoiseshell ones he used to favor. They suit him, and I know my twin picked them out. I wait for him to ask me what the hell I’m doing here. “Weren’t you wearing the black jeans before?” he asks. “What?” “Why didn’t you park in the driveway?” he asks. He peers behind me, as if looking for something. “Did you have a good session? At the café? I hope going that far east was worth it. Where’s your purse?” “I—” “And your hair!” He laughs. When he reaches out to touch a strand, my breath catches. I feel like a candle wick, drowning in hot wax. “You look insane,” he says and laughs again. “Like you put your finger in an electrical socket!” “The wind,” I say. “What are you talking about? It’s still as shit out here.” He squints at me. “You okay, Mo?” Mo. No one’s called me that since—since Frank. “Where’s your girlfriend?” I ask. I’ve startled him. It’s like he’s been hit by an invisible fist, knocked in the mouth with it, his face crumpling like a used napkin before immediately recovering, smoothing out. And then he grins. “Oh, she went to buy me a french dip from Philippe’s,” he says. I say nothing. Frank crosses his eyes in that goofy way I always hated, and I realize he’s joking. That this is our old joke, the one about our imaginary lovers who were perfect, who did everything we ever wanted them to. It was funny—until it wasn’t. I’m about to say Lulu’s name to see what might happen. “Let’s go inside,” he says, and with a great shiver I wonder if it was all a dream. Can I go inside? Pretend nothing bad happened to us? To me? I’m not sure how to respond, so I don’t move. I’m as placid as a pane of glass when a blip of red startles at the corner of my vision. It’s Frank’s car, turning onto the street. Headed slowly toward the house. My twin. “You go on in,” I say. “I’ll be right there.” I hold my breath and grab Frank by the shoulders to spin him toward the house. He feels like—like Frank. “Hurry,” I say, my voice squeaky. I’m running back to the Benz. I return to my own street within half an hour, the sun refusing to set. I want it to be nighttime, for darkness to envelop me. I want the mockingbird’s beseeching to muffle my mind. I don’t understand. To Frank, it was as if I’d never left. To Frank, it was as if our life together rumbled along. Then who was the woman who looked exactly like me? Were we like cells dividing? Were there many of us, scattered across the world? As soon as I get back to the apartment, I stop at Katie’s with her car keys. “Everything okay?” she asks at the door. She wears an elaborately tied kimono and nothing else. Wire-rimmed glasses perch on the end of her nose. Pince-nez, a long-forgotten word, floats to the top of my consciousness. “You look like James Joyce,” I say, almost against my will. “Who?” “Never mind. Thanks for your help!” I’m inside my apartment for just a minute before there’s a knock on my door. How quickly a solitary life ends, I think. It can only be Katie again, here to pry about my so-called emergency. I open the door and Min Epstein stands before me. She looks as I remember her, short and slight, but not in the least bit fragile or vulnerable. Her dark hair is brushed behind her tiny ears, which are studded with pearls, and her nails are painted pale pink. She wears a gold wedding band. Her black silk shirt, unbuttoned at the collar, is tucked into black cigarette pants, and she wears black pumps. Even in heels she is shorter than I am. She could fit a body in her giant leather bag, which I’m sure required an invitation and a black AmEx card to purchase. “Min Epstein in the flesh,” I say. She is stunningly beautiful, but the expression in her eyes tells me her beauty is the least of her powers. When was the last time I saw her in real life? Not for years. “Here you are,” she murmurs, almost to herself, and I realize she’s holding the straps of her bag so tightly that the skin across her knuckles strains. She’s frightened and using every bit of energy to tamp it down. “You better come in,” I say. She peers at me from the front step as if shocked by my very presence. With a gulp of air, she nods and steps inside. She’s still holding on to her giant bag as she looks around my apartment like a pigeon hunting for crumbs. Then she stops as if embarrassed. Again she looks at me—the only word is ogle. “Take a picture, it’ll last longer.” She apologizes. When I ask her what’s wrong, she tells me we should sit down. “I went to see Frank,” I say as soon as we are facing each other on the couch. “Oh my God,” Min says. “It was like … like I never left,” I say softly. “Did you see your double there? With Frank?” “My double,” I repeat. “I can’t believe this is actually real.” She’s looking right at me, but I can tell she’s talking to herself. It’s as if I’m in a documentary that she’s watching at home, like I’m just some person on a screen. “The rumors are true,” she says. “Please explain what’s going on,” I say. “Where do I begin?” She sets her bag on my floor with a big thump. Maybe there is a body inside. “I always thought it was an urban legend,” she says. “What was an urban legend?” “It’s lore, among lawyers. We whisper about it in law school, and if you’re at a big firm, like I was at first, there’s always gossip. Jokes. Stories. No one really believes it, but still, we talk. How can we not? It’s irresistible. Certainly there’s no one who’s ever had firsthand experience. It’s always someone who knows someone who knows someone, that sort of thing. It happens most often in divorce cases. Any situation where the clients are ripping apart something that really matters.” “My marriage.” “Your life,” she says. “So, all this time, you’ve known about my … double?” I’m not sure she hears me. Again, she’s talking more to herself than to me. “I always took it for bullshit. I don’t believe in the supernatural.” She looks at me for a long time, as if taking inventory of my presence. “After we’d been talking for a few months,” she says, “I had an inkling. Did you?” I still don’t quite grasp what we’re talking about, so I shake my head. “And then, when Frank was remarrying so soon after the divorce was finalized, I knew for sure. By then, I liked chatting with you, even if it was a little eerie.” She stands abruptly and paces around my apartment. “I didn’t realize you were, in fact, actually real. Here. In this apartment. This couch. I thought you were, I don’t know, some … voice. Your calls were a reminder of the gravity of my work. So many tragedies. I needed to acknowledge it, never forget it.” “Of course I’m real.” And then I ask, trying to sound neutral: “Frank’s remarried?” “Yes.” “To my double.” “To you.” “No, I’m here. Alone.” Min Epstein stops pacing and folds her arms in front of her chest. “I don’t know how else to say this, Simone, but a part of you—nearly all of you, really—forgave Frank. You two got back together. You married, for a second time.” “What about me?” “You’re the other part. The lost part.” The wind shrieks and keens all night, and so does the mockingbird, precluding sleep. Not that I would be able to, even in silence. Min Epstein’s words careen around my head, as does the vision of Frank the day before. My hand on his shoulder. And then I can’t stop seeing my twin: with her notebook, driving toward me. Who am I? Apparently, I’m not myself. I’m a ghost, and until today, I had no idea. So I’m a clueless dolt of a ghost. I’m a mockingbird. I’m a severed hand, still snapping its fingers to some macabre music that stopped playing years ago. You’re the lost part, Min Epstein said. How can I be found? The next morning, the world feels scrubbed clean by all the wind. The cloudless blue sky rings through my front windows. Before she left last night, Min Epstein told me she doesn’t know what will happen to me. “Until today, I didn’t even know you were more than a voice,” she said. But I’ve decided there’s got to be a way out of this. It’s Sunday morning. I know exactly where to find Simone. I knock on Katie’s door. “I swear this is the last time,” I say. The farmers’ market on Sunday is enormous, not to mention a pain in the ass, and when I left Frank, I was happy to unshackle myself from its weekly ritual. I never eat fresh vegetables anymore. Which makes sense for a photocopy of an actual human being. I head to Hollywood without any plan but to find my twin, my double. I’m certain that when we see each other our likeness will be enough of a shock to get her to speak to me, and plainly. This is another place I haven’t returned to since the divorce. I walk slowly past mountains of produce sold by beautiful farmers who weigh and bag their wares coolly. I pass that one weird woman selling her nontoxic play dough and weave among couples strolling hand in hand. Toddlers stagger from curb to curb as if drunk. The brutality of it all guts me. I hated this and I went every weekend so that Frank and I would have delicious ingredients for the feasts he made. It was part of my life until it wasn’t. This part, I didn’t miss. Simone will be here. What will I say? I imagine her holding a peach, thinking of that poem Frank always quotes. Do I dare to eat a peach? … Do I dare / Disturb the universe? It’s February; the only peaches available would have to be shipped from the Southern Hemisphere. But yes, I am about to disturb the universe like the divorcée ghost I am. She’s exactly where I expect her to be at 9:15 a.m.: talking to Marco, the fish guy. She will be trying to get sand dabs. Frank’s favorite. And hers. And mine—ours. She’s got her hair in an unfussy ponytail. She wears head-to-toe chambray, and besides that leather purse I love, there’s a straw bag over her shoulder as big as Min’s leather one, and out of the top peeks chicory and a baguette. She looks chic, happy. She is handing Marco some cash, saying “Thank you,” and then she is placing whatever fish he pulled from his cooler into the straw tote. She turns to leave. “Simone,” I call out, just like Frank did the day before. Our eyes meet and right then, the wind starts. It blows from the west, as if somewhere off the ocean it gathered strength, rising, until it eventually got up the nerve to come here, to us. The universe, disturbed. A baby bawls. The pop-up tents shading the tables of produce tremble and ruffle in the breeze, and then they flap and groan. Onions tumble. Down the line, one of the tents snaps and flies into the air. Simone looks at me, aghast, but she’s also delighted. I used to have quite the ego. Her hair whips across her face as she says, “When Frank said he talked to my twin, I thought he was playing a prank.” “He wasn’t. Can we go somewhere quiet to talk?” I’m shouting on account of the wind. People look around, alarmed or thrilled, as farmers try to take down their tents, or hold on to them. On the street behind us hulks a parking garage. I nod at it and she understands immediately. She takes my hand and the wind howls louder. We run. We are out of breath when we get into the garage. It feels strangely quiet after a windstorm like that. Smell of exhaust. Of urine. Of metal. It’s darker inside here, as parking garages always are. In the shadows, by a brushed-metal elevator door, Simone steals another look at me. “What’s your name?” she asks. “Simone,” I say. She gasps. I tell her everything I know. She needs to sit down, of course. My twin sinks to one of those concrete curbs that keep the cars from bashing the wall as they nose forward. A useful, if ugly, invention. “Now what?” she asks. “It’s why I came to find you,” I say. “I can’t go on.” “You’re in purgatory,” she said. “Lulu,” I say. She winces as if the girl were a toothache. “How could you go back to him?” I ask. “After he did that? She was 15!” “I know.” “Do you?” “It didn’t happen overnight,” she says. “Frank and I didn’t speak for months—the darkest era of my life, if you can imagine.” “I believe I can,” I say dryly. “And then, I don’t know, one day he called me and I decided to pick up. We went to dinner. We talked. We talked and talked until the restaurant closed.” “How romantic.” “Not at all. It was hard. It was intense. He was over Lulu; he finally saw how insane it all was. He wanted to try again, with me. He didn’t think I would want to but he had to see. He realizes now how awful it was for me, how foolish he was. He was blinded by … I don’t know … lust.” “What about Lulu?” “What about her?” Anger is in her voice. “She’s agreed to settle out of court. She’ll be fine. We’ll probably move somewhere cheaper, to cushion the fallout. Anyway, he already spent so much on legal fees. Thank God for Hannah’s money.” We smirk at each other. Hannah was our rich mother-in-law, conveniently dead before Lulu could shake her image of her son. “This is so bizarre,” Simone says, looking at me again. “You’re just … living in Highland Park? As another version of me?” She shivers. “Living is a strong word,” I say. She gets up, vibrating with intention; I recognize this feeling she’s having, the way I get when I’m moved to action. “How can we solve this? Because we have to solve this. Right? We have to! We need to, I don’t know, like, synthesize us.” I knew she’d understand. “I’m pretty sure I know how,” I say. She looks at me, expectant, excited. “If you leave Frank,” I say, “I think it’ll end this.” Her laugh is a dog’s yip. Incredulous. “No, definitely not.” She looks at me with sadness. “I’m sorry, but … things with Frank? They’re the best they’ve ever been. The affair strengthened our bond.” “You can’t be serious.” “I am.” My twin looks past me, at the world beyond the parking lot. From the top floor, there must be a gorgeous view of Hollywood; here, on the ground floor, it’s only sunlight and parking meters. “You don’t understand,” she says. “I let the affair go.” “You let it go?” “I had to,” she says. “For love.” “You realize I’m the ‘it’ you let go, right? And now I’m doomed to live this half life until—until when?” My twin finally returns her gaze to me. Her eyes aren’t without empathy, but there’s something else there too: pity and frustration and frustration’s more demeaning cousin, annoyance. She is annoyed to be inconvenienced by me, by the fact of me. She thought she’d let it go. My twin glances at her watch and says, “Shit, I gotta run. Can I have your number? We can keep the conversation going. We’ll figure it out.” I know she’s lying, because she is me and I can see it in her eyes and in the hurried way she grabs at her bag. She won’t tell Frank about any of this. If I call, there’s no way she’ll pick up. “I know where you live,” I say. “What’s that supposed to mean?” she says. “Are you threatening me?” Am I? Five years ago, I directed so much of my fury at Lulu. She took from me, so I would take from her. I imagined taking her young face in my hands and with one swift gesture twisting her neck until it broke. And then I’d gouge her eyes out. I should’ve done it to Frank. I step closer to my twin and the wind replies like an answer to a question, rushing into the parking lot. An empty soda bottle scuttles by and the wind yelps with rage and grief and then a car alarm goes off. Or is it a mockingbird pretending to be a car alarm? It’s not fair that a car can crush a bird under its tires. A woman too. Whatever the sound is, it’s so loud that it distracts my twin. I grab her ponytail. The wind moans. I’m supposed to be the amputated limb, the severed lizard tail, the corner of mold on a block of cheese. I refuse. I am the body that will go on. The wind and the car alarm cover the sound of my twin’s screams as I drag her by the hair to the ground and bash her skull against the concrete. It was easier than I expected. My twin lies dead at my feet, her hair matted with blood, brains. I wait for something to click on inside of me. Regret, perhaps. Horror. Or maybe I long for its opposite: some inner glow coursing through me, a feast of energy as I am resurrected, the blood of my victim running through my vampiric veins like an espresso shot. Instead, I feel nothing. Maybe, I tell myself, it’ll take some time for the computer to reboot, for me to come back online, back to myself. What will happen now? I’ll have to return Katie’s car and empty my apartment before people begin to ask questions. But even if they did, what then? One can’t investigate the murder of a ghost. Because my twin’s the ghost now. Calm as those farmers at their stands, I yank off my twin’s chambray shirt and then my own. I put on her shirt. Same with her pants, her socks and shoes, even her underwear. I stuff my own clothes and old purse inside her straw bag next to the chicory and the baguette and the fish. Out of her lovely purse, I pull out her keys. I know exactly where she parked the car, one of those secret spots off Selma. The moment I stand up, the straw bag weighing on my shoulder, something changes. I lift my chin just a little, a defiant pose. I glance down at the body. Is it beginning to fade? My vision falls blurry, like the world seen through a dirty windshield. There is no wind, no car alarm, only silence. I blink. The body is gone. Nothing. As if it turned to dust and was carried away like freeway particulate. Let go. It seems I drove Frank’s Honda again; maybe my car’s in the shop. Why he never joined me at the farmers’ market, I don’t know. From now on, I will insist we come together. The inside of the car smells like Frank’s deodorant, and I hold on to the steering wheel to steady myself. On the dashboard is a yellow Post-it that says I LOVE YOU MO MO. The world is as still as a photograph as I turn onto the old street. No breeze. My second visit in two days, which would have been unfathomable before all of this unfolded. I pull the car into the driveway, and carefully lift the bag of farmers’-market goods across the console so as not to harm the bread. Katie’s car keys are in there, along with the purse and clothes. Frank’s standing at the door, as if waiting for me. “Hey, you,” I say sweetly. “Hey, you,” he repeats. “Get my note?” “Did I?” “In the car.” “I did.” He takes the bag from me and peers inside. I wonder if he can smell the blood on the shirt, see it sprayed across the collar like raindrops on a window. “Did you get the persimmons? The good ones I like?” is all he asks. “Something like that,” I say. He looks up from the bag, the edge of the baguette sharp as a knife and nearly grazing his cheek. Does he already know, somehow? Does he recognize me? His neck, it’s so pale. His eyes glisten with feeling. I could peck them out as a bird might."

        "year": "2024",
        "story": "The girl’s expressive gifts surpass those of all the members of his company, even the aging starlet Klamt. That is something the General Intendant of the City Theater can no longer deny. Up to this point, he has done everything in his power to keep his daughter off the stage, for the General Intendant is intimately acquainted with the unscrupulousness of theater people and is well aware that if he casts her in a leading role, she will be subjected to the most malicious slander. And so will he. But in light of her expressive gifts, which have now achieved a perfection he once hardly thought possible, he must concede that withholding them from the city whose theatrical life he has sworn to cultivate (but which, under his supervision, has grown only more decadent) would be an intolerable abdication of his duty. The General Intendant therefore risks the opprobrium of the public, and the rage of the aging starlet Klamt, by commissioning a play for his daughter to star in, one especially suited to her expressive gifts, the action of which should include, he suggests to the dramatist, the following basic elements: The curtain should rise on a man in a straitjacket scrutinizing the large stained-glass window above the altar of the chapel of a psychiatric facility. The man, who for some time has existed in a perpetual present tense, suddenly remembers that he himself, in his prior life as a glassworker, created this stained-glass window, which depicts five female saints who were decapitated for their faith. He marvels at the fact that he, who now feels so far from the beautiful, was once capable of bringing such beauty into the world. As he studies the window, the man feels an urge he has not felt in a very long time: the urge to bring more beauty into the world. If he cannot bring more beauty into the world, through his mastery of the craft of glasswork, he would prefer to die. The man proclaims as much to a chapel that the audience has thus far taken for empty. But from the two wings two stout old nurses appear, brusquely tighten the arms of his straitjacket (which had already seemed as tight as possible), and inform the man that in this institution there is of course no opportunity to work with glass. As if they would let the inmates work with glass! The laughter of the nurses echoes in the chapel long after they have clacked away. But a glassworker who can never again work with glass is better off dead. He opts to die. The facility, however, has seen to it that he has no means of doing so. He despairs. Yet at the height of his despair, more memories return to him. He suffered his first fit of insanity while he was installing this stained-glass window—he remembers that now. From the time of that initial fit, he could foresee the fate that has since overtaken him—namely, that upon completion of the window, he would be committed to this very institution for the rest of his life. But while his insanity was still only intermittent, he could outwit fate by means of his craft. Yes, he recalls realizing that, too. He had then done something to the stained-glass window, or committed to memory some secret about it. He had secretly installed it in such a way that the stained-glass window would later enable him to escape through it. The clarity and force of this recollection makes the man reel. But when he tries to remember what the secret of the stained-glass window is, he cannot. Yet even this he must have foreseen, for in those first transient fits of insanity, his mind was stripped of its memories and left only with such things as are common to the species. He must have known that supplying himself with a means of escape would not be enough: He had to find a way to remind himself of the form it took and the secret of its use. He must have known that he could not entrust his memory with something as important as this; nor could he write it down, since a written message would be confiscated on admittance. He must have relied on another person. But in the whole world, as far as the man was concerned, there was only one other person. The man suddenly recalls the existence of his beloved. He remembers teaching his beloved the words she should say to him after he went insane and was committed here: Your name is Gustav. You are a glassworker. The beautiful window you see before you is your own handiwork. You must simply … and come back to me. Simply what? The very words the man needs most have been expunged from his mind. He recalls rehearsing the lines again and again until his beloved could recite them without error. Yet his beloved has never been to visit him. Where is his beloved? What has happened to her? He confides in the chief physician about his beloved. Not about the message she was to deliver, only about her existence. But even this is a mistake, for the chief physician (to be played by the great actor and tenor Silberberg) lets it be known that he wants to hear nothing more about the beloved, in whose existence he plainly disbelieves. No one at the facility believes in the existence of the beloved—no one, that is, except the two stout old nurses, who until now have struck us as cruel and unfeeling crones (one to be played by the aging starlet Klamt). In the middle of the night, the nurses enter the man’s room and convey their belief in the existence of the beloved. They pledge to locate the beloved. Lo and behold, they do locate her. They bring the beloved to him. But can this be her? This is his beloved?! The man weeps. His beloved exists now in a lamentable state. She cannot walk. She cannot speak. Only her eyes move, to and fro. Yet the movement of her eyes, viewed even from the very last row of the balcony of the City Theater, is extraordinarily expressive. To the attentive theatergoer, this movement of the beloved’s eyes expresses everything that needs to be known about her relationship to the man. The one thing it cannot express, however, is the secret message she was supposed to impart to him. This secret message is locked within his quasi-vegetative beloved. He therefore sets out to do what not only the chief physician but even the nurses try to tell him is impossible: teach his beloved to speak again. He brings her to the chapel. Positions her cane-backed wheelchair before the altar. My name, he tells her, is Gustav. I am a glassworker. The beautiful window you see before you is my own handiwork. I must simply … and come back to you. Hour after hour, with remarkable tenderness and devotion, he says these words to his beloved, always pausing long enough at the ellipsis for her to leap in and impart with miraculously restored speech the secret of the stained-glass window. But she never leaps in. Her speech is never restored. Only her eyes move, to and fro, to and fro, in a manner that is exquisitely expressive, but not of the right thing. Now visiting hours are over. The clacking of the nurses gets louder and louder. They are coming to the chapel to take away his beloved. He knows that they will not bring her back. Not ever. He tries one last time: My name is Gustav. I am a glassworker. The beautiful window you see before you is my own handiwork. I must simply … He pauses. She says nothing. Yet this time—and it does seem to him a miracle, even if it is not the one he expected—he is able to whisper the missing words himself. I must simply smash my head hard through the glass and come back to you. Now the man shatters the glass by thrusting the crown of his head through the middlemost of the five female saints. As blood streams down his face, he kisses his beloved on the lips and then climbs through the opening where the window had been. He is now free to bring more beauty into the world. The nurses enter the chapel. Their clacking ceases. For a moment, the theater is absolutely silent. Then the beloved, her face streaked with blood, suddenly leaps to her feet and screams: Your name is Bohuslav! You are a bricklayer! The implication is that he—who is to be played by the City Theater’s most physically massive actor—is responsible for her condition and is now free to commit more crimes. But this is something the attentive theatergoer will have long since deduced from the movement to and fro of her eyes. The nurses, who do not remark on the shattered window and actually seem hardly to notice it, now wheel the beloved out of the chapel. As they do so, the General Intendant suggests, the curtain should fall. Of course, he leaves the particulars to the imagination of the dramatist. The malicious slander anticipated by the General Intendant begins as soon as the cast list of The Glassworker is pinned to the wall and Klamt discovers that instead of the beloved, she is to play one of the two stout sexagenarian nurses. And that the beloved is to be played by the daughter of the General Intendant. The gist of the slander, which can no doubt be traced back to Klamt, is that the infirmities and limitations of the beloved are also those of the General Intendant’s daughter. That the daughter cannot walk, that she cannot speak, that she expresses herself with her eyes only because she is unable to express herself by any other means. That The Glassworker has been contrived specifically to allow her father to cast her in it. That only a play in which the leading lady is absent from Act I and sits mute and motionless for nearly all of Act II is one that could even conceivably feature the General Intendant’s daughter at the top of the bill. This malicious slander pains the General Intendant. But it moves him to see how little it seems to pain his daughter. She could of course disprove it in an instant. She would only have to stand up or speak. One word would be sufficient. What gives this slander some purchase is her determination to do no such thing. To rehearse the role of the beloved completely in character. To have her father wheel her into the City Theater every morning and wheel her out again at night. To have him lift her onto the stage in his arms. To communicate with no one, not even with him, not even one word. A part of him even envies the degree to which her commitment to her art leaves her indifferent to the world and its scorn. The world is something to which he himself, both as a father and as an arts administrator, has for a long time not been in a position to be indifferent. Nor is he indifferent now. The General Intendant gathers his company. It is true that The Glassworker is contrived, he says: It is contrived to remind you how much an actor can express with even the smallest gesture. The simplest gesture. The Glassworker is indeed contrived—contrived to remind the public of the power of the theater, to remind us in the theater of the power of our art. A power we have all forgotten. The company murmurs. But given the daughter’s refusal to disprove the slander, it does not go away. It only intensifies. It is whispered, presumably first by Klamt, that anything expressed in her eyes is in fact without meaning or intent and bears only an accidental relation to the text of The Glassworker. That her baffled expression isn’t acting, it is actual bafflement. That her horrified expression is actual horror. That when the General Intendant (who receives special permission from the director to join each rehearsal as a kind of informal co-director) devotes all of his co-directing energy to directing his daughter, and in particular to directing, or co-directing, her eyes—which must convey to the last row of the balcony that that man is no glassworker, he’s a bricklayer, and what he’s brought into the world is a far cry from beauty—those hours and hours of rehearsal time are gone, simply gone. How, the General Intendant points out to his company, if you honestly believe the cruel things that you say, do you suppose she will be able to leap to her feet at the climax of the play and exclaim, Your name is Bohuslav! You are a bricklayer! The company murmurs. That’s true. But it is pointed out by Klamt in turn that the scene in which the beloved exclaims, Your name is Bohuslav! You are a bricklayer! is the one scene that is never rehearsed. Finally, and in front of the whole company, the General Intendant kneels before his daughter in her chair and begs her with tears in his eyes and his head in her lap to break character. Not for her sake, he knows she doesn’t care what they think, but for his! He is weak! He does care! But when she doesn’t break character even to decline what he begs of her, he tells the company that he is proud of his daughter and ashamed of himself. Only someone so committed to her role and so indifferent to the world is entitled to call herself an actor. After this, the malicious slander about her expressive gifts is repeated less often, and less gleefully. Not, however, by Klamt, who if anything only escalates her abuse. Klamt claims that the General Intendant does not even come from the world of drama. He comes from the world of dance. He impaired his wife with dance! Slew her with an undanceable dance! A dance no one could dance! So, first of all, they were taking their dramaturgical guidance from someone who has no formal training in theater! And who murdered his wife through choreography! This in the opinion of the finest physicians! But by his lights, she wasn’t dead! No, he took her home. Sustained her somehow, though not in a way anyone would wish to be sustained. Saw an opportunity in all this: a dance opportunity! An opportunity to “start from scratch,” dancewise! Didn’t have the decency to let her die, had to make her keep dancing instead! Of course, this dance didn’t pan out. At first, there was promise. Her movements struck him as entirely new. Or rather—old! Primordial! From a stage in the development of the human organism that preceded our fall into sociality and culture and the stink of the city! Never mind whether they could really be called “dance movements”! He was struck above all by one movement. At intervals, a finger shot to her now-bald brow and traced an arc across the side of her skull. A prehistoric gesture, he thought! The meaning of which was inscrutable to him! Must stem from the innate nature of man! Upon this one primeval movement an entire school of dance could be founded! But no. One day, he notices a painting of them on the eve of their wedding in which she is making the very same movement. Coquettishly tucking a strand of hair behind one ear. Now there is no hair on her head and possibly no essence to her person, but the fashionable world is still moving her muscles! There is no “preceding our fall into sociality”! No escape from “the stink of the city”! No “prehistory”! No “starting from scratch”! Not once you’ve walked even one city block! He decides to have another child by her. Doesn’t know if this is possible. Finds that it is! This one he raises properly! Pristinely! In the dark! In the midst of the city but sheltered from the gestural tyranny of the city! Food through a slot, water through a hole and into a shallow trough! Sheltered from a city that without our knowing it is always telling us how to move and how not to! Enters her room only when she is sleeping so as not to influence her with his movements! Wants nothing more than to embrace her tiny sleeping form but restrains himself in case upon waking she retains a memory of that motion! By a thousand such self-sacrifices ensures that hers is the first childhood free from violence! No movement possibilities are foreclosed to her! Everything is possible! She can move any which way! How his daughter chooses to move is for the first time in the history of man a genuine choice! Now he simply waits to see how she will choose to move! How she will choose to dance! But—she chooses not to move! She chooses not to dance! She chooses to sit! Or else (Klamt has heard it told both ways!) the way in which she chooses to move and dance obliges him to inhibit her movements by means of straps, for her own sake, after which, even once free again, she ceases to move! Whatever the case: After a certain point, there is no movement! No dancing! Yet he cannot quite disabuse himself of the notion that she is, for all that, a dancer! To admit that his daughter is no dancer is to admit that the way he raised her may not have been in her best interest! Only in time does he disabuse himself of the notion that she is a dancer! And only by means of another notion onto which he’s able to transfer the same psychological load: that she is an actor … Now Klamt has gone too far. The members of the company turn away from her in disgust. Imagine reacting so poorly to losing a role! And the stout old nurse is still a speaking part, that’s more than most of them got! Klamt herself becomes the subject of slander. In her increasingly baroque and frankly hysterical rumormongering, some in the company claim to detect not only the rancor of an ousted starlet but also the rage of a jilted lover, an innuendo that the General Intendant asks them to rise above but also does not explicitly dispel. Meanwhile, a consensus begins to form among the members of the company that the daughter’s performance is “powerful.” Rumors of her expressive gifts spread beyond the walls of the City Theater. Before the public has even seen her onstage, she becomes the recipient of an outpouring of adoration. And on the night of the premiere, she leaps to her feet at the climax of the play and exclaims, Your name is Bohuslav! You are a bricklayer! The company is willing to testify to that, the audience is willing to testify to that. She leaped to her feet and exclaimed, Your name is Bohuslav! You are a bricklayer!—the whole city is willing to testify to that, no one will deny it. No one, that is, apart from the aging starlet Klamt. Again and again she refuses—and loudly!—to admit it. Eventually, she is sent to Dr. Krakauer’s sanatorium. Here, Klamt is asked continually by Dr. Krakauer whether it is possible that the General Intendant’s daughter said what everyone heard her say, and Klamt just missed it. She knows that admitting this possibility would be enough to get her discharged. She simply has to say the words It is possible that the General Intendant’s daughter said the words Your name is Bohuslav! You are a bricklayer! and that night she would sleep in her own bed. And privately, she will admit that of course it is possible, anything is possible. But Klamt, too, is committed to her role.

        "story": "Don’t stab me. Don’t stab yourself. Don’t draw a circle on your arm. They want the tangent to be the length of the radius. So first draw a circle on the page. Good. Now draw a line between the point of the pencil and the point of the stabbing thing. I’m not going to talk to you about that right now, because we’re doing math. So that you can be STEM and put me in a luxury nursing home when I’m old. Besides, what I liked about your father wasn’t—I can’t reduce it to one thing. May I ask why you’re interested? By “how to talk to girls,” you mean how to flirt with girls? What can I say, I’m a mind reader. I’m happy that you talk to me about what’s going on with you. When I was your age, I was very preoccupied with boys and what it would take to make them … But you’re not going to learn geometry if we … I was going to say “get off on a tangent,” but when I was 15, I would have been like, What kind of walleyed moron would even entertain the idea of making that joke? So never mind. Okay, Steven, let’s start over. What can we observe about this pair of circles? No, the points in the center are called foci; pull your mind out of the gutter. God, why do you even want to know about that? How about this: I’ll tell you what I liked about your father if after that we finish this problem set with zero digressions. Are you sure you want to hear your mother reminisce about courtship? Will you promise that your soul won’t be permanently disfigured? Is there a particular girl you have your eye on, may I ask? Sorry, of course not. Put down the compass. Because I can’t think when you’re poking your hand with that thing. Thank you. What I liked about your father was that he helped me find my contact lens. Correct, a commune. It was on 15th, which is considered South Slope now but wasn’t considered any part of Park Slope then. Because there weren’t enough assholes yet. Our building was a decrepit brownstone full of unhandy people. In the winter, there were always a few of us in the kitchen, moaning about the cold, drinking beer, without any warm clothing on. You know, T- shirts, pajama bottoms, cutoffs. The radiators didn’t produce much heat, but they did produce this homey clanking, which dangled the possibility of heat in the near future. Yes, like a crack house, I suppose, except, as far as I know, no one was smoking crack. We preferred Adderall. It was mostly grad students. In a crack house, there would have been a stronger sense of shared values and a common mission. Well, you know, your father has those broad shoulders. I’ve heard him brag about them to you by telling you how pleased he is that you’ve inherited them. Back then, he usually had crumbs on his clothing from walking around with a scone or a sandwich in his hand. He was studying for the bar, and the only way he could concentrate was to go to the park for short bursts of exercise. So he often smelled like sweat and grass. He would come home from the park with dirt under his fingernails from doing push-ups. It made his hands look homeless. Oh, yes, right, it made his hands look unhoused. He was friendly, always asking everyone how school was going, trying to start a touch-football game. He was so good at not bringing up that he’d gone to Harvard that Harvard was like this very faint hum he emitted. Yes, but a nice fridge. One hot night in summer, we were having one of our counterproductive house meetings in the living room. A guy said that we should all sign a contract governing the division of resources. Resources meaning pasta, beans, tortillas, beer, cookies, and cigarettes. Your father looked alarmed by the proposal. He liked everything to be congenial and unregimented as far as communism went, because he was a big eater. Big eaters favor a certain informality in affairs of state. He started talking over the guy, saying that what made the bourgeoisie the bourgeoisie was its fondness for contracts. Sure, maybe he was right about that; I guess bourgeois people like contracts. I know how much you value the things he says, and I think that’s nice. Are you clear on what bourgeois means? Actually, I would say that the kids at Saint Ann’s are rich. Is your crush a Saint Ann’s girl? Just asking. Sorry. Rich is different from bourgeois. Bourgeois is a French word for a person from a town in the countryside. It’s used to mean people who have a little bit of money and so they’re cautious and conventional. We moved into this apartment so that you could go to PS 39 and be in District 15; that’s bourgeois. You and I and your father are all bourgeois. I spent my adolescence dreaming of being bourgeois. Oh, I have no comment as to whether she’s bourgeois or not; it’s not my place to comment on your stepmother’s … If you want to know if your stepmother is bourgeois, ask her. Anyway. I was sitting on the couch at this house meeting, and I found the argument between your father and the contract guy so irritating that I put my face in my hands and rubbed my eyes to blot out what was happening. I could almost hear a “boing” when my contact lens sprang out of my eye onto my hand. Then it fell off my hand onto the rug. I wore monthlies back then, and I had forgotten to order new ones, so I didn’t have any spares. I shouted, “Oh, fuck, my contact lens,” thus adjourning the meeting. Everyone looked grateful. Your father dropped to his knees. He searched the carpet on all fours. I yelled at everyone to be careful not to step on the contact lens. I made them all back out of the room, except for your father. Your father had his beard down in the rug and his butt in the air. It was a good look for him. I think he felt bad about talking over the contract guy, and he was trying to redeem himself. It’s worth noting that the rug was foul. That house was full of cobwebs and mouseholes. Even holes that were supposed to be there, like vents in the stove, were de facto mouseholes. The mice would show up at our house meetings to discuss the division of resources. There wasn’t a functional vacuum cleaner or the political will to budget for one. I was one of the culprits, in terms of making the place disgusting. I was committed to eating vegetable lo mein straight from the container with chopsticks, on the couch, while watching French New Wave DVDs to educate myself. It was all part of a self-imposed training regimen. I wanted to eat with chopsticks and ape the gallic shrug. Because I’d grown up in Peru, Massachusetts, where either of those things was a crime punishable by death. I contributed a lot to the vermin problem, dropping noodles on the floor. Oh, quite bad. Every morning, in my bedroom, when I woke up and got dressed, I used to shake the cockroaches out of my shoes; we had the tiny ones. They’re called German cockroaches. I used to hold my sneakers upside down and shake them like maracas while I sang “La Cucaracha” to myself. Usually, one or two of the little guys would fall out. Sometimes they’d land on my bare feet. And then I’d go wash some more of them out of the bristles of my toothbrush. Don’t call your mother a crack whore. I mean it, really. You’re going to go around saying “unhoused” instead of “homeless” but also say “Mom, you’re a crack whore”? Besides, there was no sex work or any unseemly kind of drug use. Just filth. I was young and provincial. I wanted to cultivate good taste and a refined manner. I wanted to speak like an educated person, with an educated person’s references. It would have been nice to clean the floor, but I didn’t have time for superficialities. Kind of joking, kind of not joking. I don’t think I thought, Wow, what a chivalrous guy. I think I was aware that your father wanted to find my contact lens to prove that he was a good person. That rug had more fauna than the floor of a rainforest, and I couldn’t see very well, so I thought, Knock yourself out; I’m going to go chill. I went to my room and put on a nightgown and got into bed. In retrospect, I was playing a part in the drama, helping something happen. Why did I need to go to bed so early? Why did I need to put on my nightgown instead of my pajamas? Why did I take a book off the shelf that I hadn’t been reading, a book of poems by Frank O’Hara, and sit in bed reading it? Frank O’Hara is a cool poet. He was gay, and there are jokes in the poems. Nobody thinks Frank O’Hara is bad. I knew what I was doing. On some level, I mean. Soon, there was a knock at the door, and I answered with the book in my hand. And there, poised on your father’s trembling finger: a tiny piece of plastic, contoured to fit my eye. Was it the restoration of my sight he offered me, or was it blindness? Yes, exactly, that was irony. I can’t tell you how happy it makes me that you like to talk to me and that you recognize irony. I don’t think I can take credit. You’re just a sweet and intelligent boy. Does the girl you have a crush on like irony? I wish I could be more helpful. Other than that he found the contact lens, I liked that he didn’t try to hang out in my room when he brought it to me. I put my finger on his finger to accept the lens, and I held it to the light. It was covered in crimson fibers from the rug. I said, “What a beautiful gift you have brought me.” We named the things that were probably on it: blood, feces, goat cheese, Swiss Miss, semen. He bowed. He asked how I liked the O’Hara, and we talked about poetry, with the lens still on my finger, and then we said good night. Not hooking up even when hooking up is in the air, that’s the idea. What you want is for the girl, or whoever, maybe it won’t always be a girl, the other person, to think to themselves afterward, I wonder why he didn’t try to cross the threshold of my room. I wonder why he didn’t try to kiss me. And, gradually, for their thoughts to drift to: Wait, did I want him to kiss me? You need to give desire room to grow. People desire things they don’t have. It’s like how you’re burning with desire to grow up and go to L.A. to direct films. Don’t get me wrong; I’m so glad that’s what you want rather than, I don’t know, to live in this apartment all your life and watch TikTok and smoke weed. But you’ve never been to Los Angeles, you’ve never directed a film, and so those things are still perfect to you. You see what I’m driving at? I wouldn’t say that you’re chubby. And if you weren’t a little shy, if you were one of those kids who started dating at 12, and you were always out with your legions of friends, maybe you and I wouldn’t be so close like this, and we wouldn’t have watched so many films together, and you wouldn’t be so interesting. Maybe you wouldn’t be so well-behaved. I cannot in good conscience advise you to careen through life infuriating everyone around you as a strategy for getting a girlfriend, and yet I must admit that I was often infuriated by your dad. There was this one party where he insulted the paintings on the wall: “These are quite figurative, aren’t they?” The host had put on a Bob Dylan record, and your father condemned the entire phase of Dylan to which the album belonged. The real problem was that our host was this woman who kept looking around him, at more important people, while he was trying to talk to her. There must be a German compound word for that: looking-around-the-person-you-are-talking-to-for-a-more-important-person. He doesn’t like it when people are uncharmed by him. Sure, of course, he is charming. Yeah, he’s charmed his way into a number of jobs at this point, sure. Yes, his job does pay pretty well. It pays about the same as the one in Boston. I can believe that people in Chicago like him, sure. I don’t know if that’s the word I’d use for him, but who cares. “Brilliant” is just a very generous thing to say. I’m glad that you feel that way; really, I am. He was good at talking, sure. I think that I was drawn to, and worried by, something in him that was lost. He left that house not long after we started dating. We pretended it was because it was awkward to be a couple there, with so little privacy, but I think he could tell that people wanted him gone. He told one woman she was peeling ginger wrong and took the peeler out of her hand to show her how to do it. He mocked a guy for being bad at touch football. When I scolded him, he said, “I was raised in a bullshit-filled environment, so honesty is important to me.” I always got him to apologize to the offended party. It made me feel powerful. Because he needed guidance. He would put his head in my lap and say, “When will I be able to stop making people hate me?” Yeah, we had dinner a few times. Once in Queens, out in Fresh Meadows. The idea was to try Afghan food, but I think the real reason was that it was romantic to get in his hand-me- down, old-person car, with Jersey plates, and drive to a strip mall, and feel like we were in America. The funny thing about dating him was he always wanted to picnic in the Vale of Cashmere. That was his move. But he genuinely liked it there. You don’t know what that is? You grew up here. I guess that’s because I don’t go there, and your father doesn’t live here anymore. It’s in the middle of Prospect Park, but people don’t notice it, so it’s quiet and empty. It’s secluded. A gay-cruising spot, I think. Hills all around, a pond in the middle. The pond has a ruin around it. It was a balustrade, a stone railing from the 19th century. Now it’s just newels. Newels are the big posts, and balusters are the little posts between the big posts. The one time we did picnic in the Vale of Cashmere, we talked about why we liked children, which was a way of flirting. But also sincere: We did like children. When two grown-ups who are out on a date talk about kids, what they’re doing, beneath the surface, is imagining a future in which they have sex and raise kids. I know, gross, let’s not linger on that aspect of the … It was late summer by then, maybe September, with green scum on the water. There was this island in the center of the pond that was overgrown with weeds. The weeds were so big, they leaned out over the water and touched the scum with their leaves. Everything was very green. Your father said, “A child is like this.” He made a sweeping gesture to show he was talking about the Vale of Cashmere. He said that a child’s mind was this place that nobody had polluted. It was wild. For him, the innocence of children was this precious thing; it was a form of nature that had to be preserved. I was amused. By his sentimental attachment to the Vale of Cashmere, and by his belief in the purity of children. I didn’t buy the Rousseau–cum–Pink Floyd shit: Teacher, leave those kids alone. I said that children are joyful because they’re discovering the world for the first time, acquiring a worldview, which is joyful. You can’t separate the joy from the learning; they’re the same thing. It might have had something to do with the difference in our backgrounds. He was into noble savagery and felt that his own savagery had been compromised too soon. At the shore club. Being taught to carry himself like a politician at age 5. The firm handshake, the fake indifference to luxury. The veneer of modesty. The veneer of hardiness. The acquiring of character by meandering around the ocean in little boats. He didn’t want his child’s innate human goodness to be corrupted by the wrong kind of knowledge. And for me, my whole life, it was: Give me all the knowledge you have. Get me the information I need to ditch this shitty little town. When I was a child, my mind was not the Vale of Cashmere. It was this terrified, grasping animal. I wasn’t innocent. I was starving for data. We came to the commune for different reasons, your dad and I. He was slumming it with the punks between the end of law school and the start of his career. For me, that place was Downton Abbey. Everybody there had gone to a good school. Everybody there had a subject they could talk about for hours if you gave them a little box of wine. That was what made it unspeakably glamorous. I’ve always wanted to give you the knowledge that nobody gave me. But there was one thing your father and I agreed on: The most sacred thing you could do with yourself, more sacred even than being an artist or an intellectual, as much as we valued those things, was to be a good-enough parent to a child. My stepfather would call me “Hot Lips” as I ate my mashed potatoes, and my mother would smile as if it were a term of endearment. If you’ve ever wondered why I’ve never imposed a stepfather on you … When your father was at boarding school, when he was 13, 14, still a chunky kid; before he had his growth spurt, which might happen to you, by the way, he used to call home crying, begging to come home, because these older boys would grab his ass as he walked by. His father told him, “If you stop eating so much and get some exercise, you can play football, and then they’ll respect you.” I said, “I will never speak to a child that way, so help me God.” Your father said, “I will never speak to a child that way, so help me God.” He raised his hand in the air, to make it a vow. And I raised my hand in the air. When people are falling in love, there’s not one moment when it happens. It’s gradual. But that was an inflection point: talking in the Vale of Cashmere about how to talk to you before you existed. We did move fast. We got married a year later. You were born the summer after that. This conversation has wandered pretty far afield. We were supposed to be doing geometry, and then I was supposed to tell you how I fell in love with your father, to help you learn how to make your crush fall in love with you, and now we’re getting pretty close to your birth. This is a bad thing that’s happening right now. It’s called speaking to your kid as if they’re your friend. It’s what single parents do without even knowing they’re doing it. But now I realize that I’m doing it, so there’s no excuse. Basta. Geometry, now. I’m really mad at myself that I haven’t gotten through at least one of these proofs with you yet. We’re going to start doing your math immediately, because I’m so annoyed at myself. Yes, he was a good father. I’ll give you an example. When you were 3 years old, we bought the apartment in Greenpoint. It had no walls then. We’d barely been able to scrape together the down payment, and we assumed that I could draw up the plans for the renovation myself and save us the expense of hiring someone to draw them. But when I submitted the plans to the co-op board, they argued that I couldn’t be trusted to be the architect of my own renovation because I was incentivized to say that the work wouldn’t interfere with the plumbing or electrical lines. They rejected the plans, but we still had to move in; the lease was up on our old place, and there was nowhere else to go. One evening, when our stuff was still in boxes, I lay on the couch in despair and watched your father play with you. I realized that the two of you were actually enjoying this open-plan hellscape. He took up the Swiffer and showed you how to throw a javelin. He put on music, and you made him stand you on the kitchen island so that you could gaze into his eyes as you danced with him. You needed to be face-level with your father to dance. I was terrified you were going to fall off and crack your skull. When you got a little older, what you liked the most was when he talked to you about the law. You would memorize the things he said and repeat them to me, for my benefit: In a public park, there’s no such thing as a trespass; a public defender is a lawyer the government hires to protect people from itself; a pickpocket steals with stealth, but a mugger steals with main force or imminent threat thereof. You would recite and say, “When I grow up, I’m going to be an intellectual-property lawyer.” Very perceptive. He needed to feel that adoration coming at him all the time. I’m glad he’s told you about the affairs he had back then. It was a menschy thing, for him to talk to you about it. It’s so much better that he be the one to tell you, and it’s good you understand what happened with our marriage. Sure, but I only started after he’d been doing it for six months. He told you that, right? Good. I think it all started because of his poetry. Did he tell you about the poetry? He had this manuscript, 20 pages long. He didn’t show it to anyone else, just to me. He wanted to know what I thought. I said, “Thank you, dear, I’m so happy that you’d share this with me.” The next morning, he went to work, and I dropped you off at preschool. I went home, and I went into my study, which by that time existed. I settled into my chair, and I began to read. It would have been better if I’d hated the poems. I didn’t feel strongly enough about them to feel hate. They were a distillation of the part of him that he called honest and authentic. What I mean is that they were lyric takedowns of friends. That’s unfair of me, actually. Some awe of nature was mixed in. I said nothing about them at all. My strategy was to pretend that he’d never shown me anything and hope he’d get the message. Probably I should’ve faked raptures. Would it have killed me to writhe on the floor, just a little? But I knew that if I told him they were good, he would have rushed out and shown them to his friends and been humiliated. I was trying to protect him. Weeks went by, and then months. And then a woman called me. A painter, someone we both knew. I wasn’t all that surprised, really. I asked her if he’d shown her the poems. “What poems?” she said. I was ruined for him, you know? You’re right, that is harsh. What I mean is, my sense was that he was filled with horrific shame whenever he saw me, because I’d read his poems and thought they were bad. So he ran off to sleep with people who didn’t fill him with horrific shame. Yes, an escape. That’s why he’ll never be creative for a living: He has no stomach for rejection. Sorry, Steven, I didn’t mean to make myself cry. Can we stop for a moment and talk about this conversation? It’s hard, sometimes, knowing what’s okay to say to you when I’m on my own. There’s nobody around for me to consult when things take off in a strange direction. It’s hard to keep my bearings when I’m the only adult. Well, I’m glad you like it. I’m glad we’re close like this, that we talk. I just worry that some of it isn’t good for you. You might not be so shy around kids your age if I wasn’t always here for you to talk to. Like, you have friends, but you might have a best friend if I weren’t your best friend. Wait, are you asking that just to put off math even longer? Because there’s obviously no way I can ignore that question and force you to do geometry before I answer it. Yes, your father cares about seeing you. Of course he does. Why would you ever think otherwise? Stop jabbing your hand with that thing. Because I say so. How are we supposed to make any progress when you do that? Put it down. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Why would you think your father doesn’t— That’s wrong. It means nothing that he moved to Boston. It means nothing that he moved to Chicago. It says nothing about how he feels about you. You think he’s happy that he moved away, and then farther away? That’s really what you believe? You think he’s content, being far away from you? Tell me something. What did your father tell you about taking the job in Boston, and then the job in Chicago? Did he offer an explanation? Have you asked? “Wandering in his blood.” That’s an exact quotation? I see. “A natural nomad.” What did he tell you about why he quit the Boston job two years ago? Even though he didn’t have another job lined up? The work didn’t excite him anymore. Huh. And your conclusion is that he doesn’t care how often you see each other. I see. Can’t you tell that he’s happy and excited when he sees you? Every time we do a handover in person, he lights up when you get out of my car. That time we met him in Kerhonkson, he sauntered out of his Airbnb hut and yammered at you while you were still walking up the driveway about what hike you were going to go on and what he was going to cook you for dinner. Huh. You think that’s just his state all the time? Mr. Happy Guy, loving life in the Windy City, far away from you? Really? I’m so sorry. Okay, come here. It’s okay. It’s okay. Come here. Okay, you don’t have to let me hug you. Listen to me. In the early days, right after the divorce, when you were 6, 7, your father still worked for Fried, here in New York. Yes, with the big fish tank in the lobby, you remember. The beverage cart! What a memory you have. One Friday evening, when I dropped you off at his place in Vinegar Hill, he asked me to meet him for a drink the next day. He’d found a babysitter for you, so the two of us could talk in private. We sat at the marble bar at this restaurant near his apartment, and he ordered a Stolichnaya on the rocks with a wedge of lime—I remember the stoic voice he used when he ordered it. He rattled the ice in his glass and sang “La Cucaracha,” which was his way of saying, “Remember the old days, ex-wife, everything we’ve been through?” He told me he’d been forced to tender his resignation. He’d yelled at men in meetings; he’d flirted with a woman who didn’t want to be flirted with; he’d slept with another woman and hurt her feelings. It was his way of being a wild man, living according to his nature, being real; that was what had brought him down. He said, “Please, please, don’t tell Steven what happened.” He begged me to let him come up with a reason that would keep you from worrying that he was incapable of supporting you and that we were going to run out of money. And there he was, the Harvard boy with dirty fingernails, this divorced, balding lawyer, weeping with shame in a bar. No, we wouldn’t be here if it were just my income from the architecture practice. We’d be far from District 15, my boy. Way out in the Catskills. That’s my guess. I’ll bet there’s a Peru, New York. Maybe there. Not because I felt sorry for him, though I did feel sorry for him. Because I thought he was right. You were a small child. The truth would have scared you. It would have been irresponsible to let you know that your father had lost control and lost his job and didn’t know what his next one was going to be, and he’d have to go wherever he could find employment. Because his reputation was shot in New York. We knew it might make you think he didn’t care how far away he—I’m sorry. He said, “I know it might give Stevie the wrong impression, but it’s the only way.” I thought you might figure it out around the age you are now, on your own. Maybe a little older. It wasn’t my place to expose him, like I’m doing now. It wasn’t ego or pride that made him keep it from you. He wanted you to feel safe. I thought you’d probably figure it out when you were ready because what we told you didn’t hold water. Somebody yearns for adventure and excitement, so they move to Boston? On purpose? You wonder why he has a spring in his step when you show up at O’Hare? Because you’re the best thing in his life. By far. I mean, I would hope that he loves your stepmother. But you’re the thing he lives for, and he gets you five days a month. After seven years up there, he called me and told me it had happened again. Our money is all tangled together, you know. He has to tell me, contractually, when there’s a change in his income. Things had been fine for a long time, and then the paralegals and the receptionists all got together and requested a meeting with the executive committee and took turns saying how scared of him they were. It was the same thing. He’d spent an afternoon making a playlist—I know, I know—and then when an intern made a joke about it, a queer intern, he got angry and said something that he himself found literally unrepeatable. I asked him, “What did you say? Just whisper it over the phone; it won’t kill you.” He couldn’t do it. Thank God he had some old law-school buddies in Chicago. We still talk sometimes, you know. He keeps a journal in his desk now, at his therapist’s behest. Every afternoon, he writes down all of his impulses, so that he can see how destructive they are. I don’t know. Your guess is as good as mine. Probably impulses like: Quote Robert E. Lee at strategy meeting. Or: Ask co-worker bragging about trans child, “Was the trans thing the kid’s idea or yours?” He calls it The Book of Things I Must Not Do. You haven’t been duped. Not at all. Yes, we let you believe something that was untrue. But you can admire him even more now. Not joking. I mean, who is more worthy of your admiration? The associate at a small midwestern firm with a notebook full of unacceptable desires, trying to make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone, trying to make sure he can continue to pay child support? Or the natural nomad, with wandering in his blood, rolling dice, looking for work that excites him? For me, the answer is obvious. What’s that face? Why does that make you angry? I don’t think that was a cruel thing for me to say. You’re just used to thinking of him as a demigod. Are you okay? How are you feeling? Will you tell me? Stop poking your hand with that thing. Because I’ve told you it bothers me. It’s not a smart thing to do. That’s my compass, and I’m worried you’re going to—I’m serious. It’s driving me insane. You’re going to break the skin. You’re doing it too hard. Not joking. Give it to me. You’re bigger than I am now, so I need you to give it to me. You’re going to drive me nuts if you keep doing that. You’re doing it too hard. Why won’t you talk to me? Steven. You’re going to hurt yourself. Talk to me, please. I’m going to change the settings on your phone if you keep doing that to your hand. Do you hear me? I’m going to lock up the Xbox. You’re acting like a child. A person who does this is a person who is spoiled. I might not succeed in taking it from you, but if you don’t stop, I’m going to try. Are you really going to fight me off? Okay. Thank you. Come here. Let’s have a look. I’m sorry I said those things to you. I was upset. I’m going to get the hydrogen peroxide and a Band-Aid. You’re going to be fine. Hold still. Then we’re both sad. Yeah? It’s normal to want to go back to how you used to be. I miss my old self too. For example, I miss when we had flying roaches in the commune in August. I had a technique I developed: I sprayed them with Windex when they were airborne. Your father called it anti-aircraft fire. He used to watch me, shouting encouragement. Like “Direct hit, London.” The Windex gummed up their wings and brought them down. It was all we used Windex for. You’d hear this tiny thud when the big ones hit the linoleum. It really did look like a bomber catching flak, going into a death spiral, and crashing. Then I’d advance, blasting it with the Windex, until it was almost paralyzed, kicking its legs in slow motion. Your father got some paper towels and finished the job. Sometimes it was a struggle; they’d hide behind a shelf or whatever. None of them eluded us for long. I thought your father and I would always be a team. Ignorance is bliss. When you’re a grown-up, the past is this incredible party, and you can’t get there. Yeah, like L.A. But I’d rather be here, talking to you. Okay: geometry."

        "year": "2024",
        "story": "After their second week of volunteer farmwork, Gabriel and Caro subjected themselves to a twin ordeal: lunch with her parents on Saturday, lunch with his on Sunday. The idea was to gain parental trust, but within 15 minutes of entering the Ravests’ chilly apartment, Gabriel understood that it would be impossible for him to win Caro’s mom over. She watched him with the measured suspicion of a downtown cop. Even as she refilled his Coke, passed him dishes of salted peanuts and green olives, and ushered him into the dining room, Gabriel felt thoroughly unwelcome. He recognized that he could be projecting. Also, he had no clue how to charm adults. It had never occurred to him that he’d need to try. He did achieve some light sparring about the Copa Libertadores with Caro’s father, a man so quiet that he seemed distant even when he was sitting beside Gabriel, but once that fizzled, everyone seemed at a loss. Caro kept twisting her hair. Her mother asked Gabriel a battery of questions, but none that lent itself to an answer longer than a sentence. It was tough to elaborate on not having siblings, or not liking his school, or not knowing what job he wanted someday. The meal itself was not on his side. Caro’s mom had made trout with lemon. It was delicious, but it was also full of translucent bones. Gabriel kept failing to notice them, which meant he kept having to spit fish ribs into his napkin. He had the strong suspicion that the dish was a table-manners test. After dessert, Caro went unbidden to the kitchen, returning with a thermal carafe of hot water and a brown jar of Nescafé. Her mother produced four floral china cups from the sideboard, asking, “Gabriel, how many scoops?” “Two, please,” he said, mindful of instant coffee’s scarcity. She narrowed her eyes. “Two?” “Yes, please.” “So you like watery coffee?” “Ma,” Caro interceded. “Let him drink it how he wants.” “I’d like your boyfriend to drink his coffee how he wants it,” her mother said, sinking a spoon into the coffee crystals. Pope Paul VI glared from a framed magazine cover behind her. His cassock fluttered; his crucifix reflected the sun, or the camera’s flash. Señora Ravest went on: “Instead of asking me to make it weak, because he thinks we can’t afford more Nescafé.” Gabriel couldn’t recover from that. No chance. He gulped his thin coffee, sick with shame, and fled the moment he could. On the riverbank that evening, he informed his friend Nico that the lunch had been an unqualified and possibly unprecedented disaster, and that he’d probably have to go into hiding because there was no imaginable way he could live it down. Nico thumped his back, then handed him a flask. “What’d you expect? To have fun?” Gabriel drank, wincing at the alcohol’s burn. The settlement across the Mapocho River shone with lantern light. He picked burs from his socks with his free hand. “How’d it go when you met Alejandra’s parents?” he asked. Nico shrugged. “I knew them already.” “So it went well?” “No.” They both laughed, and Nico, reclaiming his flask, said, “Don’t worry. Doesn’t matter how bad meeting her parents was. Introducing her to yours will be worse.” Nico was right. Gabriel’s parents insisted on taking Caro to the Polo Club, where she had never been. He spent 10 minutes explaining to his mother that it was not, in fact, astonishing that Caro had lived most of her life in Santiago—right here in Vitacura—without entering the club’s dining room. It was completely normal, and could his mom please just not make a big deal? Gabriel hoped Caro would enjoy the Polo Club more than he did. She’d get a great meal and great people-watching, and she liked the challenge of easing herself into unfamiliar settings. He had seen her do it on farms, at Communist Youth meetings, at the May Day march downtown. He told himself the Polo Club would be no different. She might even think lunch there was fun. He released that hope within a minute of walking Caro through the club’s massive wooden doors. She seemed to shrink beneath its vaulted ceiling. She bit her lips and held herself taut as the maître d’ escorted them to a table. Seated, she unfanned her starched maroon napkin and sat on the edge of her gilt chair, glancing at the dining room’s high brown beams and painted faux-heraldic shields. The walls were heavy with framed pictures of members past, a legion of black-and-white white men holding oars and rackets, mallets and clubs. Gabriel had the brief, terrible thought that if Caro were mestiza—if she were even the slightest bit brown—this meal would be a crisis just by virtue of its location. As it was, the situation didn’t look good. His father had ordered a double scotch before sitting down, which sent his mother into a fit of silent ring-spinning. Caro couldn’t stop staring at the buffet, which meant Gabriel couldn’t either. Never before had he registered what an impossibility it should be for the Polo Club to have a buffet when the average bread line stretched two blocks. The chafing dishes were full, and sparkled with Sterno and silver polish. Their domed hoods winked open, displaying grayish sliced roast beef, herb-crusted chicken breasts, scalloped potatoes, roasted potatoes, shoestring fries, cubed zucchini, and more little golden cups of individual quiches than any club member could eat. The excess was both unconscionable and confusing. Who knew an aboveboard, tax-paying business could get this many eggs in June 1973? Or this much beef? Did some club member fly it in personally from his not-yet-expropriated ranch in the south? Gabriel filled his plate. How could he not, given the hungry wonder on Caro’s face? She seemed otherwise miserable. He refused to increase her discomfort. Instead, he trailed her down the buffet, taking exactly what she took. At the table’s end, he looked up to see that somehow the afternoon had gotten worse: The maître d’ was leading Carlos Aldunante and his parents into the room. Gabriel tried closing his eyes. Aldunante was still there when he opened them. He tried praying, but God neglected to prove his existence by airlifting Aldunante from the room. Instead, Aldunante sat and shook out his napkin, looking delighted to be there. “Can we sit back down?” Caro asked. “People are looking at us.” He pointed with his chin at Aldunante. “See that kid? The ferret-looking one? He goes to my school.” “So?” “So Nico and I are skipping school to do the farm brigade. I told them I was going to see my grandparents in the United States.” “Will he tell?” Gabriel nodded. “He’s a fascist. He hates me.” Caro balanced her plate in one hand and tucked her hair behind her ears with the other. “Aren’t most people here fascists?” “Yeah, but not like him. He’s an actual Nazi. In Patria y Libertad and everything. A couple weeks ago, he announced to our whole class that the Holocaust didn’t happen.” Her eyes narrowed. “You didn’t tell me that.” “I didn’t want—” Gabriel sighed. He appreciated the horror in Caro’s expression, but what could he say? I didn’t want you to imagine me getting Jew-baited? It was humiliating enough to have to deal with Aldunante. Now that he’d told her, he knew his instinct had been right: Caro knowing about it made him feel worse. She stepped closer. For the first time since their arrival, her shoulders dropped to their usual height. Behind her, the Polo Club gleamed the dull gleam of brass and mahogany, feather dusters and floor wax. “Didn’t want what?” “To make you think about him. He doesn’t deserve it.” “What’s his name?” “Carlos Aldunante.” “Carlos Aldunante,” Caro repeated. A new expression crossed her face. Gabriel couldn’t identify it. Only once she had led him back to his parents’ table, set her plate down, and directed herself briskly across the dining room did Gabriel, trailing in her wake, realize that the look had been malice. Aldunante was alone at his table; his parents had gone to the bar. His eyes lit up when he saw Gabriel and Caro approaching. “Lazris!” he called. “I didn’t know you were in town. And I didn’t know they let Jews in here.” Caro raked a hand through her hair. “You must be Carlos.” “I am.” “I go to school at Santa Úrsula. I’ve heard all about you.” She lingered on the “all,” spinning and stretching the word. Gabriel had never heard her use a tone this nakedly flirtatious. It was like listening to a different girl. “You have?” Aldunante asked. “Of course! You’re famous.” She paused. “For having the smallest dick in Vitacura.” Gabriel burst out laughing. His girlfriend was a genius. He wished he had his friend Ítalo’s camera. Aldunante’s horrified face should be preserved in its full glory ’til the end of time. “All the girls talk about it,” Caro continued. Her voice was matter-of-fact now. “They say scientists are going to study it after you die. But, you know, better tiny than circumcised. Right?” Aldunante didn’t respond. Gabriel felt as if he were levitating. Victory glowed in his chest. “Don’t tell anyone you saw me,” he said. He had never sounded so tough in Spanish—or possibly in any language, including the private mix of his own mind. “And I won’t tell anyone at school about this.” As he and Caro crossed the dining room, he told her, “I was wishing I hadn’t let my parents drag us here. Not anymore.” She rewarded him with a kiss. “I enjoyed that.” “So did I.” At the Lazrises’ table, Gabriel’s father was eating already, which was a major violation of family etiquette. Gabriel had been trained to not even touch his fork until everyone was seated. His mother asked, in her awful Spanish, “Who was that?” “A classmate of mine,” Gabriel said in English. His mom showed only marginal relief at switching languages. “Who you absolutely had to go see?” He grinned; he couldn’t help it. Beside him, Caro cut a careful square of roast beef, looking highly pleased with herself. “I’m sorry,” Gabriel said, doing his best to sound, if not sincere, at least meek. “I promise, we’re all yours now.” Gabriel’s delight got him comfortably through the first half of the meal. His father, having wolfed down two chicken paillards, paused and began asking Caro questions. He spoke Spanish but couldn’t understand her replies. Caro, in turn, did her best with her school English, but her vocabulary was too limited for her efforts to make much difference. Gabriel still had to relay to his parents that she was an only child; that her mother was a baker, her father a high-school teacher. She wasn’t a fully subscribed Communist but was seriously contemplating joining the party; she was worried about civil war, yes; no, she didn’t—“Mom! Why would you ask that?”—want to move to the United States when she grew up, but she did want to leave Santiago. “Really?” Gabriel said, as an aside. “I didn’t know that.” Caro nodded. In Spanish, she said to Gabriel, “Not necessarily for my whole life, but I like the idea of living in different parts of Chile. The mountains, the desert.” She shrugged. “I know a lot of people want to live abroad, but I’d rather figure out what part of my own country I like best.” His dad cleared his throat. “What was that?” “Caro was telling me she wants to live in other parts of Chile.” “Very admirable.” His father reached for his drink, which was his third. He had a green fleck of parsley in his teeth. “Tell her I like to see young people taking an interest in their native country.” Gabriel looked at his mother, who looked at the chicken bones on her plate. He was tempted to snatch and drain her full wineglass. Also to march his dad across the room to Aldunante, saying, “You wish I were more patriotic? Ask Carlos here about patriotism. Ask him about Patria y Libertad. Maybe you’d like him to be your kid.” He glanced behind him to see Aldunante hunched over his plate, curled into himself like a snail. His parents visibly paid him no mind. Pity crept into Gabriel’s chest, unpleasant and unwelcome. Aldunante deserved to be mocked and ignored. Deserved worse. He, Gabriel, wasn’t going to wreck Caro’s gift to him by feeling guilty about it. “Gabriel,” his dad snapped. “I told you to translate.” “Eat fast,” Gabriel told Caro in Spanish. “My dad’s going to start a fight.” “What was that?” his dad asked. “Nothing.” “Don’t lie.” Gabriel lifted his hands in fake surrender. “I was translating for you.” “I don’t think so.” His dad’s face turned the high lilac of anger mixing with alcohol. He reached for his scotch glass, and Gabriel’s mother, as if killing a fly, swatted his hand to his lap. He twisted to face her. “Vera.” “Yes?” “Am I a child?” She squared her narrow shoulders. “Apparently.” Gabriel heard his own breath catch. Beside him, Caro set down her fork. He tried and failed to speak. He was so accustomed to inserting himself into his parents’ arguments, or starting new arguments to derail theirs. His mother had never, in his memory, performed the same service for him. Was this her backward way of making Caro feel comfortable? Or was he watching his mother’s marital patience finally run out? “Only children can’t control their reactions, Ray,” she said. “Children and drunks.” Nobody moved. The dining room clinked around them. Soft classical music washed among the tables. A tweed-jacketed woman to Gabriel’s right released an absurd, trilling laugh, like a human xylophone. “Vera,” Ray said again, enunciating hard. “I am under significant stress.” “I know.” “Of which you are a leading cause.” She coiled her shoulders back, rising in her seat like a charmed snake from its basket. Her various diamonds glittered. Alarmingly, so did her teeth. This was not like her. Her truth-telling was helpless and soft, not sharp-edged and frightening. “I refuse,” she said, “to let you blame me for your paranoia.” “And I refuse to let you be willfully ignorant.” The back of Gabriel’s throat swelled. His lunch congealed before him: overdone chicken drying white as sawdust, creamed corn solidifying in its pale-gold fat. Though his stomach turned, he kept his gaze on his plate. If he looked at Caro, there would be a non-negligible risk of tears. “Maybe,” his mother said, “if you shared what you claim to know—” “I know you and Gabriel need to leave.” Gabriel snapped his head up. His mother’s face blazed with fury. His father’s cheeks were now newsprint-colored, his eyes red and bulging. He looked like a street-corner crank. A soapbox preacher. He looked like Nixon on TV. “Good parents want their children to be happy,” Vera said. “And our son is happy here.” “He won’t be happy once war breaks out.” Gabriel couldn’t speak. Caro took his hand beneath the table. He was still frightened to look at her. He tried to concentrate on the tablecloth, which had faint fold lines running across it, a coffee ring half hidden by a saltshaker. “The Chilean government,” his father continued, “is weeks from collapse. A few months at best. Nobody—and I mean nobody—knows when the end will come. It could be September, or it could be next Sunday. And if it’s next Sunday, Vera, how am I supposed to protect you? How can I keep you and Gabriel safe if you won’t go?” Gabriel dragged his chair forward, making its legs screech on the polished wood floor. “I live here,” he said. “This is my home.” “I’m your father. My job is to shield you from danger.” “I don’t want to be shielded.” “When the air force bombs Santiago, you will.” Rage coursed down Gabriel’s spine. The glow he’d felt earlier returned, harder and hotter. He hated his father. “Whose air force?” “Chile’s.” “On whose orders? With what money?” Ray shook his head. For once, he was silent. Gabriel could not bear to meet his eyes. He stood, tugging Caro to her feet. Blood hissed in his ears. His vision fuzzed like it did before orgasm. He leaned over the table and spat, “You should get some new sources. Talk to somebody who tells the truth.” His father gave no sign of hearing. His mother was as impassive as a doll. Caro let him lead her across the dining room, past Aldunante, through the club’s vaulted hall, and onto the abandoned patio. Stacked wicker furniture loomed at its edges. The winter sun stung his eyes. Icy air washed over him, shrinking his anger to fear. “How much of that did you understand?” he asked Caro. “None.” Gabriel glanced past her. Brown polo fields rippled into the distance. Beyond them, high wooden fences concealed the shanties—settlements—in which the ball boys and stable hands lived. If he were Caro, he would claim not to have understood even if he had. “Nothing at all?” he asked. “I heard ‘air force,’” she said. “Nothing else.” Gabriel dug his elbows into his sides. He had been working so hard not to be afraid. “My dad,” he said, “is full of shit.” Caro nodded. “He has no idea what this country is like. He isn’t a real reporter.” “What is he?” “A CIA mouthpiece.” Caro stepped back. “No.” “He helps them,” Gabriel said, twisting the word “helps” as hard as he could. His fear receded a notch. “He told you?” Gabriel shook his head. “I figured it out.” “How?” “Looked in his desk.” Caro opened her mouth but didn’t speak. Gabriel attempted a smile. He doubted that it worked, but effort counted. He imagined his parents watching through the dining-room windows. Aldunante, too. His dad’s handler could be in there right now, wondering what the hell his pet writer’s kid was doing out in the cold. He took Caro’s hands. She drew close enough that their noses touched. Softly, she said, “I’m happy you trust me.” “I do.” “You know,” she said, “I bought a Courier a couple weeks ago. Some of the newsstands downtown sell them. I thought I’d practice my English by reading your dad’s column.” His whole body warmed. “Did you?” “I gave up after a paragraph.” She laughed a little. “I would have tried harder if I had known it was propaganda.” She paused. “Is anything he writes real?” Gabriel hesitated. It was possible that not all of his dad’s columns contained propaganda, but he had read enough to know that every single one was intellectually bankrupt. “No,” Gabriel said, looking squarely at his girlfriend. “Nothing at all.” Caro skipped farming the next day. In the morning, she called to tell Gabriel she was sick—“or else,” she added, “my body forgot how to digest red meat.” He made sympathetic sounds, doom already pulsing in his chest. He was prepared to bet she wasn’t sick. She was probably bracing herself to break up with him. Who could blame her? Why would she willingly subject herself to future episodes of The Ray and Vera Show? He was so miserable, he didn’t even tell Nico about Caro leveling Aldunante’s pride. Why bother? Caro would never come to his defense again. He spent the day harvesting greens in grim silence, imagining his bleak, girlfriendless future. How had he lived nearly 17 years without Caro’s questions? Without her awful singing voice, or the mischief in her eyes before sex? He’d been like a prisoner in Plato’s cave—a concept his religion teacher loved, though in the priest’s telling, the allegory was about discovering God, not girls. Fucking priests. Plato had no Jesus. Plato was centuries before Jesus. Gabriel was sick of Catholic school. He was sick of teachers and parents and being underage. He wished he could dig a hole in the dirt and curl up inside it. He wished he could start university tomorrow and never again talk to anyone from his present world—barring Nico and Caro, if by some miracle she didn’t dump him. On Tuesday, she returned. She seemed a bit pale, and didn’t lead Gabriel to the lunch shed for afternoon sex, but that could mean either romantic disenchantment or lingering sickness. She skipped again on Wednesday, and one of the antisocial brothers in their brigade approached Gabriel, asking if Caro would be back. “I have a friend who wants to join,” he said. Gabriel scowled. He was tempted to say, “You have friends?” Instead, he snapped, “She’s coming. Tell your friend to sign up faster next time.” He hoped he wasn’t lying. What if Caro vanished? What if she decided she never wanted to see him again? On Thursday, Caro boarded the old van as usual, but Gabriel was not reassured. His mind swarmed like an anthill. He knew better than to ask Caro if she wanted to break up with him, but he couldn’t help it. He needed to know. That day’s farm grew potatoes, yams, and sunchokes, which they were digging and collecting in crates. Gabriel tried to distract himself with the tactile sensations of farming: wet dirt stiffening his hands and massing under his nails; cold creeping through his jeans and long underwear; humidity swelling through his sinuses. Not helpful. He wondered if the intellectual side of farmwork was learning to catch and release these feelings, or to enjoy the muddy chill instead of resenting it. It didn’t matter. He appreciated nothing. He would appreciate knowing if he was going to get dumped. Caro wasn’t behaving unusually, but what did that mean? She was, in general, a highly controlled person. She could hide her emotions. She could be suppressing the relief of knowing she was nearly free of him. Gabriel couldn’t stand it. He managed to wait only the amount of time it took Nico to fill one crate of tubers. As soon as his friend trundled away with his box, Gabriel turned to Caro and asked, “Were you actually sick yesterday?” Caro narrowed her eyes. Wisps of hair danced at her forehead. “Puking ’til noon. Why?” Embarrassment needled at Gabriel. Also doubt. “I just want to know.” “I’d like a reason.” She sat back on her heels. Her face was taut with annoyance. “Do you think I’m a faker?” Wind raced between them, smelling vaguely of laundry starch. Gabriel stuck his finger into the sugar-brown dirt. “No.” “So?” “So I was scared—” He swallowed. “I got scared that you wanted to break up with me. I’m still scared.” “Why would I do that?” “My parents.” Her face softened, and she reached for him. Her gloveless hands were chapped and striated with earth. Clouds moved behind her, thin as pencil marks. “I don’t want to break up with you.” Gabriel laced his fingers through hers. Pressure began to gather behind his eyes. “I would be sad if you did,” he said. “Worse than sad. But I wouldn’t blame you or get angry or anything. I would understand.” To his astonishment, Caro laughed. “You don’t have to understand. I’m not dumping you.” Then, for the first time, she added: “I love you.” Gabriel heard himself squeak. Completely involuntary. A mouse’s sound. Caro smiled at him. She looked pleased with herself, not regretful. She wasn’t blowing away like dandelion seed, or sprouting a second head, or otherwise revealing herself to be a dream or hallucination. She was his real girlfriend; he was sitting in a real, cold potato field, with real wind wailing around him, real tears about to freeze on his lashes, real mucus threatening to drip from his nose. She leaned forward to kiss him. Her lips were chapped, her tongue mildly salty. He had never felt so fully as if someone else was in charge of his life. He could have been Caro’s pet, or her puppet. It was a perfect sensation. He hoped it would continue ’til he died. He wiped his face on his sleeve. “I love you,” he tried. “Too. I love you too.” Caro’s mouth curled up. “You better.” “I promise.” His heart was racing. “I do.” This story has been excerpted from Lily Meyer’s forthcoming novel, Short War. "

        "story": "Carlito held one end of the rope, Omar the other. The three of us wore orange vests to seem official. Sebastián, our lookout, hid behind some bushes. “¡Here comes one!” I picked up my shovel and dug out some of the dirt we’d dumped in one of the potholes covering the road. Omar held up a gloved hand, signaling for the car to slow down and stop. Things had gotten more difficult for us recently, with the news warning of false checkpoints, where men dressed in military or police uniforms stopped vehicles under the pretense of government-sanctioned searches, forced all the passengers out of the car, and then drove off to have the car scrapped or sold. There was talk of rapes and beatings when the passengers failed to comply, and sometimes those things did happen. But we weren’t like that—we wouldn’t have known what to do with a car if we had managed to steal one. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. We wanted drivers who were willing to spend money to get dirt off their car but not smart enough to keep us from looking inside. A car with fully tinted windows meant someone who might have more money on him, but we risked bullets getting lodged in our throats. Non-tinted meant less money, but also that we’d be alive to spend it. The best was a clean car with a fishbowl windshield—someone who had money but was stupid. Sebastián had just flagged a silver Toyota with a cracked mirror. The car wasn’t only dirty, but had tints. The worst combination: a driver who was broke and dangerous. We’d warned Sebastián about this before, but he was still a kid, barely 13. He’d be shaking with nerves and excitement, holding the tip of his dick through his pants to keep from pissing himself, and the moment he saw a car, he’d call out to us, not bothering to notice what shape it was in. When the car came into full view over the hill, we all got into position. I stood in the middle of the road, leaning against the shovel and wiping my forehead. Omar and Carlito held the rope with little orange flags hanging from it. When the car stopped, I approached and motioned for the driver to roll down his window—barely visible through the darkness of the glass, the driver, who was wearing sunglasses, raised his hand, asking what the issue was without speaking. I pointed at the road, the potholes, my shovel. “Construction,” I said, not sure he could hear me. The man shook his head no, then tried to pull forward, but I stepped in front of the car. “You can’t go through until we’re done,” I said. The man honked his horn. He motioned for us to move, and when we didn’t, he honked again. Then again, each honk seeming longer and louder than the one before. I looked over at Omar. He nodded and let the rope slacken to the ground. We didn’t want to draw unwanted attention. We’d made that mistake once and almost gone to jail because we kept trying to get the driver to roll down his window while he leaned on his horn. A police car had been not half a kilometer down the road from that spot, and we’d had to take off running into the jungle, leaving behind our rope and vests. We hadn’t tried stopping cars there since. But that didn’t bother us much; we moved up or down the highway when we felt a location was getting too hot. This spot was different because we’d been there for more than a week. The main draws were the uphill advantage on one side, and the two-kilometer visibility on the other. With the rope dropped, the man behind the wheel let up on the clutch and sped down the road. We watched his taillights fade. “¡Sebastián!” Omar yelled at him. “You stupid son of a—” “¡Here comes another one!” Sebastián yelled back. Carlito rolled his eyes. “¿Does this one look nice?” I called out. “I think it’s a Mercedes,” Sebastián said. Omar, Carlito, and I exchanged glances. Yeah, Sebastián was an idiot, but we had hammered home what fancy cars looked like, using the auto magazines we’d stolen from the supermarket back in the capital as guides. He’d once let two cars get by us while we hid in the brush, thinking them not worth our while, but Sebastián was good at alerting us to cops. We got into our positions and waited for the car’s logo to crest the hill. Sure enough, a black Mercedes. I wiped my forehead again, sweaty from the anticipation. Omar held up his hand and kept the rope taut with the other. I was already picturing what we would do with the money—ice cream, dinner at a restaurant, a hotel room in a nearby town. We were all in desperate need of a shower, a night when we weren’t eaten alive by mosquitoes or whatever creatures crawled around the jungle floor in the dark. We heard the purr of the engine and watched as the car got closer. By the time we realized that the car was speeding up, not slowing down, it was too late for Carlito and Omar to let go of the rope. I almost couldn’t jump out of the way. “¡Fuck!” Omar yelled as the rope tore out of his palm and got caught in the wheels of the car. “Motherfucker.” Holding his hand, he watched the rope get dragged off by the Mercedes. I eyed the car and saw the rope tumble free from underneath the tires. “¿You okay?” I asked Carlito, who was holding his left hand, rope-burned. He nodded and looked over at Sebastián, who was running down from his hiding spot. “Holy shit, holy shit,” Sebastián said. When he reached us, Omar smacked him on the back of the head with his good hand. “I’ve told you about saying those words,” he said. “Go get me some water.” Sebastián looked defiant for a moment before laying eyes on Omar’s hand. He ran into the brush for one of the gallons of water we kept next to the tents we’d made from tarps and branches. Carlito crossed the two-lane highway and sat down next to us. “¿How much money do you think he had in his wallet?” he said. “Let’s not think about that,” Omar said. “It’ll make it hurt worse.” Sebastián ran back with the jug and gave it to Omar. He uncapped the gallon with his teeth and dumped some of the water on his and Carlito’s hands, then took a swig from it. “¿Does it hurt?” Sebastián asked. “It doesn’t feel good.” Omar slid out of his vest and took off his shirt, wrapping his hand in it. He instructed Carlito to do the same, tucking the end of a sleeve into the folds to keep the bandage in place. “¿Now what?” I asked. Omar looked at me like I’d spoken in tongues. “We still got about four hours of sunlight,” he said, as though blood wasn’t soaking into his shirt. I couldn’t believe it. “You and Carlito can’t hold the rope,” I said. “I got two hands, ¿don’t I?” he said. I knew that letting the Mercedes get away would bother him unless we made enough for a hotel room that night. Omar took another sip of water, then held it out to the rest of us. We all shook our heads no. Omar shrugged and swigged from the jug, letting water run down his chin and onto his neck, down his flat stomach. He was mostly skin and bones like the rest of us, but his muscles were more defined. While Sebastián and Carlito mostly got tired, Omar and I gained muscle from chopping wood or walking from town to town when we couldn’t get a bus or van to pick us up. Omar was 20, born three years before me, and just over four years before Carlito. Sebastián had been a surprise. “All right,” Omar said. He capped the jug of water and shoved it into Sebastián’s chest. “Go get us some clean shirts,” he said. “One for Jaramillo too.” I looked at my shirt. Dirt all down the front of it, a tear near the navel, from when I’d landed on a rock jumping out of the way of the Mercedes. Sebastián walked, rather than ran, back into the jungle and then came out with three shirts. I put mine on and tossed the dirty one on the road as a car drove by, heading down the hill. “We’re already losing money,” Omar said, signaling for us to get into position. He leaned forward and grabbed his end of the rope and stared off into the jungle, waiting for us, like a statue, a saint. The patron saint of highway robbers. The rest of the day was successful. We managed to stop a few cars, avoiding the vans and buses. Too many people meant that we could be overpowered and held down until the cops showed up. We’d toyed with the idea of fake guns, but usually unsheathing machetes was enough to get drivers to comply. Plus, the driver might pull a real gun on us. “I think we have enough,” Carlito said, counting out money for a room. “Not if we want to eat,” Omar said. He motioned for Carlito to get back to his side of the road. “¡A blue Kia!” Sebastián called down from his hiding spot. Omar nodded. “Last one.” He waited for us to get into position before lifting the rope. When the car appeared at the top of the hill, I made my way over to the driver’s side and told the man to roll down the window. He did so without hesitation. “¿Yes?” he said. Omar and Carlito grabbed their machetes while I reached in to unlock and open the door. “All we want is your wallet,” I said. I noticed movement in the back seat. Someone who had been lying down sat up with a jerk. I jumped back, expecting a setup, before hearing my name. “¿Jaramillo?” The voice was familiar, but I didn’t know why. The rear door swung open, and out stepped Leslie. “¿What are you doing?” she asked. Leslie used to live in the same village as us. She was the same age as me, worked at my father’s bakery just like I did, before one of the maras took over the village. The gang members had come without warning, without plans of negotiating, with violence. Anyone who opposed them was never heard of again. The mareros were all business, all gold teeth and tattoos—the last thing our parents ever saw. The same thing had happened to Leslie’s mom. I looked at the driver. Mr. Cortez, Leslie’s dad. “We,” I started, “we were checking if you needed directions.” Leslie looked at Carlito’s and Omar’s machetes. Sebastián came puffing down the hill in a cloud of dust. “Check the trunk,” he said. “Ah,” Leslie nodded. “We just wanted something to eat,” I said. She looked at Mr. Cortez, still behind the wheel. “We have some snacks,” she said. “We can get our own,” I said. “¿What kind of snacks?” Sebastián said. “¿Are y’all heading to Peacheque?” Carlito asked. “¿Do you guys want a ride?” Leslie asked. I looked over at Omar, told Carlito no. We had to stop at least one more car. “The town’s near the lake, ¿right? ¿Why don’t we meet there later?” she said. “Nah, we’re good,” Omar said. Leslie nodded, told us to come find her if we wanted. She gave me a sad smile and got back in the car. We watched her disappear. The mosquitoes were out, and it was getting dark. That was the worst part about the highlands. That and the humidity. I missed the lowlands on hot days like this, when you stepped out of the shower and immediately began sweating. I missed the desert; the wind, unobstructed by leaves, that hit your face. I missed home. Omar kicked some rocks onto the highway. “There’ll be another car soon,” Carlito said. “Yeah, then we gotta come back out here tomorrow and do the same thing all over again.” Omar picked up some rocks and launched them into the jungle. I reminded Omar that it had been hard since before we’d been forced from our homes. “Seems like Leslie’s doing fine,” Omar said. “It’s not her fault.” I looked at the ground. “Yeah,” Omar said. “If only our dad had been a coward too.” None of us knew what to say. It wasn’t fair to think like this, but sometimes it was all we could do. When the mareros came in, they offered each family 100 quetzales—enough for a family meal at Pollo Campero—to leave immediately. To grab their belongings and never come back. Those who stayed, who called the police, who wrote to the government, like our parents, didn’t last the week. Leslie’s father was among the traitors who gave up, took the money, packed his things and his daughter, and fled. His wife stayed behind, refusing to leave her home. When the mareros came for our parents, Carlito, Omar, Sebastián, and I snuck out the window in our room. We heard gunfire in the kitchen and didn’t stop running until the sun began to shine along the highway. We never stopped running, just like everyone else who made it out alive. All of us, cowards. Omar wiped his hands on his shorts and grabbed one end of the rope, again with his good hand; the other hung by his side. The rest of us weren’t sure whether to speak. We got into place just as some headlights made their way over the hill. In town at the hotel that night, I wondered where Leslie was. I tried to picture which room was hers. “I’m gonna take a walk,” I said. Omar let Sebastián escape a chokehold. “¿Since when?” “I’ll be back soon.” Omar held the door closed as I tried to leave. “We don’t need her help,” he said. I pushed past him and the door slammed behind me. The night was warm, same as always, and the streets were crowded. Vendors sold tacos and ice cream out of carts, souvenirs from small booths. Why anyone would want to remember this place was beyond me. Younger kids chased one another and dodged oncoming traffic. Drivers honked at them or yelled from their windows. Down one of the three streets that made up the town, the elotero could be heard ringing his bell and shouting into the night. The lake was calm, disturbed only by the sound of small animals jumping into the water. I bent down and picked up a small stone, illuminated by a streetlamp, and skipped it across the surface. I was reaching for another when I heard my name again, spoken as though she was still surprised to see me. “I was hoping you’d come,” Leslie said. She hugged me, and I couldn’t remember the last time I’d felt someone’s arms around me. “I’m sorry. It’s just nice to see someone from home.” “I know,” I said. “¿Should we walk?” I nodded. The water lapped at the shore. The wind carried the sounds of the vendors and children in town as though they were messages in a bottle. “¿How long has it been?” she asked. “Almost two years.” This was something I tried not to think about. Each day felt like the one before as we struggled to survive. “¿Is this what y’all have been doing?” I couldn’t tell what Leslie was thinking, but I knew she wasn’t judging me. I was sure that she and her father had struggled at first too, and that no one was willing to help. The government ignored us—the cops ignored us—telling us we should have been prepared. And for the longest time, I couldn’t understand why the mareros wanted our town. But Omar finally figured it out while looking at a map, plotting where we’d set up our next trap. Right between two big cities, our village served as a hub. “¿What about you?” I asked. Leslie sighed, then looked up at the moon, which was full. “We moved around a lot, like you.” I knew what she meant. We were like turtles, carrying our houses on our backs, settling wherever we could. Leslie put her hands in her pockets and told me that she and her father had tried to go to the capital, but that the mareros had also taken over their family’s neighborhood there. She told me that they’d finally found a place outside Quetzaltenango, but that her father couldn’t get a job and had ended up selling cold drinks on the side of the highway. His foot had been run over while handing someone a drink through a car window, and after that, she said, they’d been on the move. They searched for a place to work without having to walk too much. “I think we might stay here a few days,” she said. “There are worse places.” We walked quietly for several moments. “¿How long have y’all been here?” she asked. “A week.” “¿And you stop cars every day?” I nodded. “¿How do you not get caught?” I shrugged. “We don’t make much.” Leslie nodded along. “¿Can I help?” I couldn’t tell if she was joking. “I don’t think Omar would let you.” “I could help make you more money.” She stopped walking and smiled at me. “Then I bet he’d let me.” “No fucking way,” Omar said. We were standing by the side of the highway again, the sun just starting to rise, when he noticed Leslie walking up the road. I hadn’t told him the night before because I knew he would say no. But I figured if she showed up while we were already here, he’d at least have to listen. “It’s a good idea,” I said. “We barely make enough without having to split it with someone else.” He looked toward Leslie, who was close enough to hear us now. “We don’t need anybody else,” he said. “Good morning to you too,” she said. “Get her out of here,” Omar said to me. “¿Jaramillo told you my plan?” Leslie asked. “¿To give you all our money? Yeah, he told me.” “Think about how many more cars would stop,” I said. “I only want a fifth, same as you,” she said. “¡Carlito!” Omar shouted. “Grab the rope.” Carlito crossed two lanes to the other side, afraid of upsetting Omar any further. I scooted closer to Omar, away from Leslie, and whispered to him. “Just one car.” Omar held his end of the rope. He looked at me out of the corner of his eye. “Fine,” he said. I smiled and patted him on the back. Leslie was already pulling a small knife from her purse. She made a few rips in her ankle-length skirt, then grabbed two fistfuls of dirt and covered her shirt, her arms, and her hair with it. She spread out her arms like, ¿What do you think? Omar rolled his eyes, but I gave her two thumbs up. Leslie inched toward the road and lay down. Omar shrugged his shoulders, mumbling under his breath, and stood by her head. Carlito crossed back over to us and followed Omar’s lead. I knelt by her feet as Sebastián ran up to his hiding spot. A few minutes later we heard a car engine. “A Ford,” Sebastián shouted down to us. We took our positions, trying our best to look worried. As the car summited the hill, I waved my hands to flag it down. Carlito and Omar pretended to check Leslie’s pulse before cradling her head. As the driver noticed Leslie’s body, the car slowed. Then its window lowered. “We need some help,” I said, sounding panicked. “¿What happened?” The driver pulled over and put the car in park. “She was crossing the road,” I said. “She got hit.” The man unbuckled his seat belt and opened his door. He walked over to Leslie, Omar, and Carlito. As soon as he reached them, Leslie sat up with her little knife and told him to empty his pockets. “¿What is this?” The man put his hands in the air. Omar made quick work of checking his pockets, emptying his wallet. Carlito ran over to help me search the car. We found snacks, unopened water bottles, and some clean clothes to hawk or grow into. A new tire we could sell to a mechanic in town. We unloaded everything and told him to leave. “Not a word about this,” Omar said—the same thing he said every time. How seriously drivers took him, I could never tell. “Or we’ll find you and take more than just your shit.” The man walked indignantly to his car. He slammed the door shut. Dust and pebbles sprayed as he sped down the road. “The very first car,” I said, when he was finally out of sight. “Probably luck,” Omar said, counting the money in his hands. I could tell he was happy about it. When he caught us watching him, he hid his smirk. He pocketed the bills and told us all to get back to our places. “¿You think we made enough to retire or something?” Leslie and I exchanged smiles. Then she lay back down on the hot road. By the end of that first day, after we’d sold the tire, along with the expensive cameras and phones we’d found in a car full of tourists that we dared to stop, we’d made more than we had in the past several months combined. “Don’t get too happy,” Omar said. “She’s leaving soon.” He counted out some bills and gave Leslie her share as we stood outside the hotel. The sun set to the sound of beer bottles opening. “This is more than my dad would make at work.” She fanned the bills and brought them to her nose. “Maybe I can convince him to stay longer.” “No need. We’re moving too,” Omar said. “Spot’s too hot now anyway.” I followed him as he walked inside. “We should do it again tomorrow. We should use her while she’s here.” “Just because it worked once doesn’t mean it’ll work again.” Omar turned to Leslie. “¿What would your dad think about what you’re doing?” Leslie shrugged. “Not sure he’d care,” she said, folding the money into her pocket. “One day doesn’t make you a highway robber,” Omar said. “So stop trying to act like one.” “One more day,” I said. “We can’t make this kind of money without her.” “¿Why not? We can get Sebastián to play dead, and it’s the same thing.” “¿You really think cars would stop for a bunch of guys standing on the side of the highway?” Leslie said. “¡Enough!” Omar yelled. “One more day,” I said, following Omar to our room and signaling for Leslie to come too. He threw our empty pizza box from the night before against the wall. “We had a good day. Let’s not fuck it up by talking stupid.” Sitting on the bed, he began removing his shoes. I was scared to say anything. Omar’s temper had gotten worse since we’d left home. One good thing about it was that no one had ever picked on me at school. Not after Omar put a kid’s head through the cafeteria wall. I had never asked for his help, and I was scared to thank him for it. “¿What if I moved with y’all?” Leslie said. Omar and I turned to look at her. “We could hit a few spots, and after I made enough to last me and my dad a few months, I would leave.” “You don’t know anything about this life.” Omar shook his head, then was silent for a minute. “Now get the fuck out of my room,” he said. With that, he lay back in bed and covered his eyes with a pillow. I followed Leslie out. “I’m sorry.” I closed the door carefully behind us. “¿Why’s he being such an asshole?” she asked. “He’s scared.” I could see the top of her head now, all the dirt she’d have to wash out. As Leslie reached the landing, she spun around. “So then I guess this is goodbye.” “I’ll talk to him,” I said. She extended a hand when I was hoping for another hug. “It’s whatever. If he doesn’t want to make money, that’s on him. Maybe I’ll see you down the road.” She patted her pocket with the cash in it, then spun back around and left me there. Omar was waiting for me in the doorway to our room when I got back. “¿Why’d you tell her no?” I pushed past him, noticing that he’d picked up the pizza box. “We’re better off.” He followed me into the room. “Look, she’s cute, I get it, but we can’t be taking on another person,” he said. “I have to look out for all of you. She’s not family, she’s not my responsibility, and I don’t trust her.” “We all lost things back there. That makes her family.” Omar sighed. “¿Why don’t we get something to eat? We can talk about it over a Gallo or one of those American beers.” “I’m not hungry.” “Yeah, you are. I’m buying.” Omar bought a small bottle of rum on the way to the seafood place. He almost never drank, mostly because we didn’t have the extra money for alcohol, but also because we had to be up early every morning. At the restaurant, he ordered a Coke and a glass and kept adding more and more rum. By the time Sebastián and Carlito found us there, Omar was pretty drunk. “¿What’s up, guys?” Omar said. Carlito looked at me like, ¿What the fuck? “¿Why are you so happy?” Sebastián said. Omar kicked two chairs out for them. A waiter came by. “¿Can I get you anything to drink?” “Just water,” Carlito said. “¡Get what you want!” Omar said. The waiter looked at Carlito and Sebastián. “Just a water.” Carlito sat down. “I heard we’re leaving tomorrow.” “¿That bitch tell you that?” Omar said. “Stop talking about her like that.” I pushed Omar. “Yeah, she did,” Carlito said. “He just wants to fuck her,” Omar said. I stood up, balling my fists, ready to swing. Last time we’d gotten into a fight, it had been over a twin mattress we tried to tie on top of someone’s car. Even then, I think I knew we couldn’t drag that thing around, but I was tired of sleeping on the floor, tired of waking up with a branch or rock digging into my spine. Omar had given me a black eye and a busted lip; we didn’t talk for days. It had been the rainy season, and we took turns sleeping outside because we couldn’t stand being under the same tarp together. “Fuck this,” I said, swiping a biscuit from the table. I put it in my mouth and held it between my teeth, and flipped Omar off with both hands. As I headed for the exit, I could hear him calling after me, but I didn’t stop to listen. I walked outside and passed beggars and people on their way home from work. People sharpening their machetes and sweeping their front stoops and playing dominoes. I walked past children kicking around soccer balls and setting off small, handheld fireworks. I walked past the vendors selling fruit and ice cream, and finally made it to the hotel, where the front-desk worker nodded and waved me through. I didn’t have a key. Maybe that’s what Omar had been saying when I left. I turned the knob to our room for good measure and the door creaked open. Inside, everything was exactly as we’d left it, except that Leslie was standing in the middle of the room. She held something in her hands. When she saw me, she startled. She wiped her forehead with the back of her arm. “I thought it was Omar.” I stepped inside and felt like I was the one in the wrong place. I nodded at her hand. She shoved the bills into her pocket, then looked directly in my eyes. “You’ll make this back in no time.” She stepped toward me, but I blocked the door. “I left you some,” she said. The tips of our shoes were almost touching. “You understand, ¿right?” Her lips were right below my ear. “I’m sorry.” She reached for the doorknob. The bottom of the door hit my heels and I stood there for a second before moving out of her way. Later that night, Omar tore our belongings from the drawers and threw them onto the floor. He tossed out our clothes and the few toys from when Sebastián was younger. He snatched and pulled the tarp so hard that our machetes and water jugs fell from the dresser to the floor. We watched him shake it out like he was doing a magic trick. “¿Where is it?” Omar said, digging through the drawers as if he’d missed something. The next day we walked down the road, sticking out our thumbs and hoping someone would give us a ride. No one stopped. The only person who pulled over was a bus driver, but we didn’t have the fare. We dragged our feet and kicked the trash lining the highway gutters. When the sun began to set, we entered the jungle and put up our tarp. Looking up at it was almost like looking at the night sky, except without the stars. We never made as much money in one day as we did with Leslie. Sometimes the memory of her would make me laugh. What do you call someone who robs the robbers? Omar would say “stupid,” but I don’t think so. I would say she’s a thief hoping to sit at the right hand of God. Just like us."

        "story": "Listen to the first chapter of Xochitl Gonzalez’s forthcoming novel, Anita de Monte Laughs Last. If it weren’t for what happened later, everyone would have forgotten that night entirely. It wasn’t like the ’70s, you know? Nights when you never knew what could happen, what to expect. No, by 1985, the parties in New York were all the same. One night, one party, bleeding into the next. Nothing specific or momentous enough to press itself into your memory. The guests, the conversations, the taste of the fucking wine on your lips, all more or less the same. Especially Tilly’s parties. Formulaic, interchangeable. Some felt that’s what made them work, but me? It depressed me—that impossible distinction of the passage of time. The drinks were always set in her claustrophobic galley kitchen. To force intimacy. The food (what little there was—WASPs hate feeding people) was set atop the piano in the center of her massive loft. The poor, young artists hovering while it lasted. The music just loud enough to soften silences, but too muted to inspire true revelry. Over the years, Philip Glass was replaced with Sun Ra. The “hot new” artists aged into establishment figures or disappeared altogether, replaced by other, younger faces. All the big museum people were always invited, naturally. Tilly enjoyed the thirst shared between those two groups in particular: the haves dangling their opportunities tantalizingly before the have-nots. It created a great “friction in the room,” she’d remarked once. After years when I was the only brown speck in attendance, lately there’d been a noted effort to populate the guest list with more “Third World artists.” This sudden concern for diversity coincided with the Met hiring its first Black senior curator. I’m not being cynical, just honest; it would have been embarrassing to invite her to a party and have her see only white people there. But outside that, in all the years of these fetes, very little had changed. Except, I suppose, for me. If you were in New York and in the art world, you did not refuse an invitation from Tilly Barber. And, for whatever reason, that night was particularly crowded. Bodies and conversation packed close enough to create a hum. I remember feeling a restless excitement when I arrived. The kind you feel when you’re giddy from holding a secret, one with wings that flap furiously against your palms. Knowing that, any moment now, that secret could fly up! Out into the world. Its motion changing fortunes and futures, oceans or even lifetimes away. And I, the only one containing it. Such a power! Giancarlo was telling me a story. I was listening, but not. He always came back from Rome with the longest stories. I was distracted, knowing that at any moment, he’d arrive! Jack Martin. My husband. And then, as if I’d willed it by simply glaring at the doorway, he did. Jack likes to enter rooms slowly. To stand and hover before he makes his way, glacially, into a space. Some people think this is because of his size; he’s become quite mammoth these past years. His physical form expanded, I think, intentionally to match his scale of import in the art world. The more generous attributed Jack’s heavy-footedness to the rumored injuries sustained from years of lifting rods of iron and setting down plates of steel. “Each and every piece of art that’s ever borne my name,” he will tell you within breaths of meeting you, “was installed by me and me alone.” That explanation is, for me, the most ripe—picked with callus-free hands from the vine of Jack’s decades-old propaganda tree about working-class roots. But here is the truth, the kind of truth only a wife can really know: Jack plants himself like a lightning rod, drawing the kinetic energy of everything and everybody his way. Still and quiet so that, for a moment at least, the attention of the revelers is pulled from whatever conversation they were having or joint they were smoking or person they were trying to fuck, and drawn instead toward him. The party, if not the world, spinning around Jack Martin. So it was that night. From the corner of my eye, I watched him enter the loft and linger. Waiting. Around me, conversations, bright and raucous just seconds before, suddenly became muted as people noticed his presence, and they all mentally calculated if and how and when they could talk to him. Even Giancarlo’s voice trailed off. I stole a cigarette from him and pretended not to notice as Jack, finally feeling acknowledged, crossed the room toward the kitchen. I didn’t need to look up to know that’s where Tilly was. Normally, this would have annoyed me: that he always sought her out before he ever even looked for me. That she was, in my opinion, the only one he genuinely respected, far more than for being one of the best art dealers in the world. Far more, even, than for making his career. Really, I think, just for being her: steely. New England elegant. Any other day, this would have driven me up a wall. Drawn out my sharp cat claws. But on this night, I had the flapping wings of secrets, restless in my hands. I was excited—delighted, even—that he’d finally arrived. I was wearing my favorite dress, the one I’d bought in Iowa from a secondhand store. It was from the ’60s, with big, silver paillettes, each as large and round as the eye of a cow. Clustered so tight and voluminously, they tinkled softly, like wind chimes, when they rustled together. I had put on the only heels I wore anymore. Artists, when they are working, should have little need for heels. I was wearing the red lipstick from Guerlain I had gotten in Paris. Tonight was an occasion: the close of a special day and also the opening of ... I did not know in that moment what. But it was going to be something new. I was ready to start the adventure. “Giancarlo,” I said, as I grabbed his hand, “my husband is here. Let’s go and tell him our good news!” We wound our way through women in black dresses and seductions in progress and scrawny boys with paint-stained pants arguing about nothing, until we finally reached the kitchen. I paused in the doorway for a second and watched them. Together. Tilly mid-thought, cigarette in hand, lips parted to say something thoughtful. Tactful. Jack, midway through opening a fresh bottle of champagne, the festive gesture in chiaroscuro to his dour expression. Both so wrapped up in what they were talking about, in one another, that neither of them noticed me. “Perfect timing!” I finally said. Giancarlo, behind me, pushed his way into the tiny cookery. “We need a refill! To toast my wonderful news.” Jack looked me up and down, a closed smile curling up tight against his teeth. He hated this dress. He thought it looked cheap. Like New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Hated the racket it made. The way the paillettes shed like snake scales if I moved too quickly. Hated that I moved too quickly. “Tilly was just telling me,” Jack said as he refilled our glasses, the grin still taut on his face. “A dozen prints sold to the Met. Not bad for my little orphan Anita.” “Anita!” Giancarlo exclaimed. “All night talking, and you didn’t even tell me! Well, that will definitely build buzz around your show.” I raised my glass and ignored the shock that had seized Jack’s countenance. Didn’t even look at Tilly, lest she ruin my mood. “Giancarlo is going to show me in Rome,” I announced. “Solo.” “Congratulations, Anita!” Tilly said, genuinely impressed. The fact of which almost annoyed me more than if she’d treated it like garden-variety information. “What’s the expression, Tilly?” Giancarlo offered. “A no-brainer! Have you seen her new sculptures?” “Nobody has,” Jack said, his voice strained, his smile finally faded. “I haven’t,” Tilly said, disregarding Jack. She avoided my gaze. Her manners masked her cowardice. “Tilly hasn’t asked to see my work since 1979,” I said to Giancarlo, “and even then, it was only as a favor to Jack. Isn’t that right, darling?” Jack pulled me tight to him, the sequins and my lungs crunching together as he did. He raised his glass. “Well, cheers! Quite the lucky day for our shooting star,” Jack said, saccharine dripping from his voice. Human will is a particularly powerful magic. Alchemy happens when a person truly decides something, when a mind is changed. We’d shared exchanges like this hundreds of times before, my husband and I. Tiny acts of violence enacted with words. Exchanges that had cut and left me bleeding, with my best stuff—confidence, clarity—pooling down, away from me, onto the floor. But not that night. No. Because that day, I had decided to reclaim my might, to cease to be shrunk. And in my decision, I’d grown a new version of myself. My new skin thick like coconut shells, impervious to his attempts to crack my joy. My triumph at my accomplishments, my exultation in my own art, my euphoria at this new power I’d discovered in simply deciding to change my mind. All of it now in safekeeping, deep inside my new self. Later, when I saw him across the room, practically entangled con esa cabrona gigante—Inga or Ingrid or whatever her name was—it wasn’t that I didn’t feel rage. No, it was that in my decision to strip him of his power, I was able to transmute that anger into joy. The specific type of joy one can only feel by really fucking with someone’s head. Poking at exactly the right tender spots. The spots only a lover, and surely a wife, can really find. So yes, I saw them—that other woman, with her long, blond hair hanging down like a sheet, leaning against the glass window; him, with his arms braced on either side of her, their faces practically touching—and my first feeling was anger. Resentment. Not just because we were in a room where everyone knew us—because I am someone too!—but because she wasn’t even a good artist! She made derivative, exhausted, color-field shit that he would have pissed all over had it been done by someone with a cock. Instead, he’d bought three of them and hung them in the fucking living room. At least if he was going to carry on this way, he could do it with someone with real fucking talent! But of course, talent scared Jack. Then, like finding a $5 bill in an old coat pocket, I remembered my thick, coconut-shell skin and that I had changed my mind. “Quimbara” trumpeted from the stereo, and I turned to my friend Jomar and suggested, loudly, that it seemed like a great time to dance. “Someone turn the music up,” I commanded. The boy Giancarlo was trying to seduce eagerly obliged. Tilly’s parties were not dancing affairs. They were more gatherings than celebrations. Openings without the art. While I knew that dancing was not something she’d like, it was something she’d tolerate. Americans love to see Latins dance. Dance, fuck, fight. Anything, really, that’s meant to be done with passion. And besides, the guests who remained by this point were the most drunk, the most high, the most bored. Thirsty for entertainment. Jomar was an amazing dancer, the kind who knows how to make his partner look better than she is. As we moved, I could feel the attention of the room now move toward me. Not as a lightning rod, but as a wind, a wave. Something in perpetual motion that touched everyone gathered. Around me, I could feel their thoughts and assessments and presumptions: Anita de Monte, art star on the rise. Anita de Monte, winner of the Rome Prize, winner of the Guggenheim. Anita de Monte, a once-in-a-generation artistic voice. Anita de Monte, immigrant opportunist. Anita de Monte, a one-trick pony. Anita de Monte, the wife of the legendary Jack Martin. Anita de Monte, lucky bitch. Anita de Monte, the most miserable bitch alive. No one realizing that I was all of these things at once, and more. “It’s just that I miss dancing,” I said to Jomar, in my best stage whisper. “My husband doesn’t dance, you see. Not a salsa, not a waltz. He won’t even do the twist.” I didn’t direct any of this at Jack, of course. I didn’t need to. I could feel his gaze on me, hot like fire. He hated a spectacle. Unless it was his. I saw him swat la sueca gigante’s hand away, sensed him heading toward me. To “save me” from embarrassing myself. My hero. I kept up my performance. The crowd began to clap to the beat of the music. They cheered us on through lunges and copas and dips. And then Jomar began—slow, and then faster, faster—to spin me. Around once: I saw Tilly stop Jack. Around again: glimpsed the giant Swede storming out. I laughed loudly. I had just ruined his night, as he had ruined so many of mine. I felt radiant with delight, felt the flutter of my secrets, knowing soon they would be free! Jomar spun me around and around, again and again and again. Later, when word got out that I had fallen (jumped? or, could it be, pushed?) out the window, this was what everyone would talk about. How they had just seen her! Anita de Monte. That very night! How she had been laughing. And how she had been dancing. And how, when she spun around and around, the silver sequins of her dress went flying. Up and into the air. Like the feathers of a molting bird. This story has been excerpted from Xochitl Gonzalez’s forthcoming novel, Anita de Monte Laughs Last. "

        "story": "The Georgia men wake everyone in the drenched dark. The pain of the march simmers through me, and I wipe at my mud-soaked clothing, swipe at the threads of soil in my wounds—all of it futile. We are tired. Even though the Georgia men threaten and harass and whip, we chained and roped women plod. “Aza,” I say, sounding the name of the spirit who wore lightning: “Aza.” Every step jolts up my leg, my spine, my head. Every step, another beat of her name: Aza. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. We walk down into New Orleans, and each step is a little falling. We leave the lake and the stilted houses behind; the trees reach, swaying and nodding on all sides, and us in the middle of a green hand. When the hand opens, there is a river, a river so wide the people on the other side are small as rabbits, half-frozen in their feed in the midmorning light. Aza disappears. The boat that carries us over this river is big enough that all the women fit. There is no reprieve from our rope here. This river is wordless, old groans coming from its depths. After we cross, there are more houses, one story, narrow and long, and then two stories, clustered close together, sometimes side to side, barely space for a person to stand between them. The grandest are laced with wrought iron and broad balconies: great stone palaces rising up and blotting out the sky. Long, dark canals cut the city at every turn. The air smells of burning coffee and shit. People crowd the streets. White men wearing floppy hats coax horses down rutted roads turned to shell-lined avenues. White women with their heads covered usher children below awnings and through tall, ornate doorways. And everywhere, us stolen. Some in rope and chains. Some walking in clusters together, sacks on their backs or on their heads. Some stand in lines at the edge of the road, all dressed in the same rough clothing: long, dark dresses and white aprons, and dark suits and hats for the men, but I know they are bound by the white men, accented with gold and guns, who watch them. I know they are bound by the way they stand all in a row, not talking to one another, fresh cuts marking their hands and necks. I know they are bound by the way they wear their sorrow, by the way they look over an invisible horizon into their ruin. But some brown people look like they ain’t stolen. Some of the women cover their hair in patterned, shimmering head wraps, and they walk through the world as if every step they take is their own. They are fair as I am, some of them even fairer, as milk-hued and blue-veined as the white women in their bonnets and hats. I slide close to Phyllis, lean away from the caravan of wagons rumbling past. A handful of women snake by; their head wraps are bright and glittering as jewels, and they look everywhere but at our bound line: stooped, bleeding, and raw from the long walk. “They’re free,” I tell her. “Who?” Phyllis asks. “Them.” I point with my chin. Phyllis sneezes and wipes her nose on her arm. Three boys, heads shaved, follow behind an olive-skinned woman in a cream head wrap. The boys stare at us, their eyes wide and wondering, and the woman, who must be their mother, grabs the closest by his shoulder and herds the boys in front of her. “Non,” the woman says. She hurries them to a trot that matches the horses pulling the wagons. “Allons-y.” One of the boys trips, but she bears him up with her hand on the back of his collar. “Move,” the Georgia Man says, shouting us deeper into this warren of a city until he stops outside a wooden fence high as two women standing on each other’s shoulders. Haphazard roofs, tiled and patched, show over the top. There is a gate at the center of the fence, and as it swings wide, the sound of someone wailing in the enclosure swoops outward. “In,” says the Georgia Man. We walk in a knot through the door. I look back at the two-story houses and stone businesses. A white man with a bushy mustache stands on the porch of a home, his hands shoved in his pockets, watching us being herded. His face as blank as the windows. “In, girl,” the Georgia Man says. The man across the street rubs one hand down his black-vested chest and tips his hat. The gate closes, ill-fitting wood scraping, and we are inside. We enter into a courtyard clustered with buildings: Two are tall and whitewashed brick. The rest are short and windowless, their bricks dark as the river. The ground beneath us is beaten to dirt and sand, nearly as even as a wooden floor. But there are footprints in it, so many footprints: the dimples of five toes, the smooth ball of heels, sometimes ringed by the mark of a horse’s hooves. The Georgia Man enters one of the tall buildings, and his men dismount their horses and lead them to a stable. Laughter echoes from inside the buildings. Dogs yip and bark at the noise. “Come,” says one of his men, short and burnt red at the forehead. His hair snakes below his collar. We women follow to one of the long, low, dark-brick buildings, while a white man leads the chained men to another building—this shack’s twin. We women stoop to enter, and when I stand, my hair brushes the ceiling. The taller women stoop and shuffle into the close darkness. There are no windows, and the only light comes from cracks between the bricks. The man takes his time untying us; the first woman he unbinds limps to the farthest corner of the room and sits. One woman drops to her knees right as the rope is taken off. Another hunched woman holds her hands in front of her like she has an offering, listing side to side. Phyllis slides down the closest wall. When my length of rope falls, I step backwards, slowly, as I did with my bees on days when it took time for the smoking moss to calm them. For a moment, the longing for my hive feels so strong, it makes me stumble to remember: the clearing, the old char of the tree, the honey, amber and heavy. “Annis,” Phyllis says. The Georgia Man closes the door. I sink to the floor next to Phyllis, lean my head back against the brick, close my eyes, and try to recall how beekeeping taught me to hold myself still, my mirth muted. How once, in my breathing, there was joy. We sleep hungry, wrapped in rags. Phyllis’s rasping breath has turned to a hard, hacking cough. Some of the women snore, but most of them are still and silent as fallen trees. Snakes of smoke coil on the ceiling, and I wonder if this is where my mama came, if she slept on this floor too. If she laid in the close, hot darkness and thought of me. I scratch my scalp and imagine the press of my fingers as my mama’s the last time she washed my hair, oiled it, and braided it. I scoot so that my back grazes Phyllis’s, and for one minute, I let myself pretend she’s my mama, warm and whole. A tendril of smoke winds through the crack of the bricks, gathers to sooty coils under the seam of the roof. Aza takes shape in a darker black. “You came back,” I say. “Others called.” “Did you follow my mama here? To a pen?” I whisper. Lightning rings Aza’s neck before sizzling to darkness. She does not descend to the floor. “Yes.” “What happened to her?” I ask. The lightning arcs across her head in an electric halo. She frowns before speaking. “The same that will happen to you,” Aza says. Her face changes. A softening around her eyes could be sympathy, but then it is gone, fast as the zip of a flitting hummingbird over her cheek. “You will sorrow. One will come and take you away.” “You know?” I ask. “You know where my mama went?” Hope foams up my throat, and I do my best to swallow it all, the feeling, the hope, down. “Out of this place,” Aza says. “She was taken away, north and inland.” The feeling, the hope, is a heavy cream now, and it sinks down to my stomach. “Did you follow her?” I ask. Aza finally descends in a blanketing mist. “She was ill, but she wouldn’t call me.” I reach out a finger. At the edge of Aza’s smoky garments is a pepper of cool rain. Her face is placid, still water. “Spirits need calling,” Aza says. “That’s the last I saw of her.” I ball my hand into a fist and rub it against my stomach: It aches with cold. “You knew she needed you,” I say, and wish I hadn’t. My hope gone rancid, bubbling up to eat at the back of my tongue like acid. What I don’t say: You did nothing. Aza is sharp and beautiful in the darkness. She looks away from me, beyond the brick walls, and her profile, for one perfect moment, is my mother’s. She seems near, near in the night, and longing clangs through me. “Yes,” Aza says. “Sleep.” I turn to my side, wondering how cold can soothe one moment and sear the next. They make us wash in a trough before they dress us in sack dresses, all the same color brown. They take the first woman away midmorning while we are crouching in the low, dark building. When the first woman returns, she stumbles into the room before slinking into a corner. She refuses to speak, even when the other women crowd her, asking after her. Men come to the door and take us away, one at a time, calling us by name: Sara, Marie, Elizabeth, Aliya, Annis. When the white man, featureless in the blotted-out doorway, calls me, I follow him into the bright, hot day. The slave pen is dusty and barren, but over the gate that separates us from the outside, the treetops lining the street sway. Clouds, with the underbellies of doves, float in the sky. The horses roped to poles shuffle and neigh. Men’s voices tangle into one rope, loop around me, squeeze. I can’t breathe. The white man leads me through the door of the grand building that the Georgia Man entered yesterday, but the Georgia Man is gone. There is a fireplace and a mantel inside, candlesticks to light the room, glowing before mirrors edged in gold. There is a desk, a table with ornate scrolling at the corners, and high-backed wooden chairs. There are five white men, clean-clothed, their hair smashed flat in indents left by the hats they’ve hung at the door. They are white-whiskered, tall and short, paunchy and lean, pale. They wear watch fobs. Their teeth gleam in the candlelight. “Come here, girl,” says the shortest and paunchiest of them. He is red at the edges: his hands, his hairline, his cheeks all mottled red, as if he has slashed some animal’s throat and been splashed with blood. Another white man, lean and bald, stands next to him. “Good gait,” the short man says. “Bright eyes.” “She looks healthy enough, given you feed her,” says the lean man to his paperwork. “As I will,” the short man says. The lean man scribbles and talks over his shoulder. “Take her in.” “Yes, sir,” a voice says, and it is only then that I notice the brown woman, her hair covered and wrapped, her eyes on the floor, who stands from her seat and walks toward us, her shirt and skirt loose and plain. She puts out her hand to me but doesn’t take mine, and she turns, expecting me to follow her, before disappearing through a small door. The men are all watching me, but they say nothing. Inside, there is a low table with a stained cloth on it. I don’t want to go anywhere near it, but she points and says, “Please, sit.” I perch on the edge so the wood cuts into my legs. “That’s the doctor, and he’s going to examine you. Ensure you’re healthy, and if something wrong, he’ll treat it.” She talks, but she looks beyond me, as if there is another me behind me, floating midair, ascending through the ceiling. Aza, I think. Aza, you said you would stay. “You understand? Nod if you understand.” I look at her, right at her: the splash of freckles across her high forehead, the mole at the side of her nose, the crooked set of her canine teeth. “You understand,” she says. Aza, I think. This woman free. Who spare her? The doctor walks in. “Undress,” the woman says. Aza, look, I think. Look at her. I pull my sack dress over my head. I swallow a small sound when the air touches my skin with a chill hand. Aza. There is a shimmering at the side of my eye. “He’s a doctor,” the woman says. She glances toward me and her eyes stick for a moment, and then she looks away. Shame like a frown on her. “He’ll … examine you,” she whispers, and she looks past her folded hands and down to her feet. Aza, I think. Please. The waxy string bean of a doctor walks in and measures: height, hands, feet, waist, legs, arms, and head. He looks in my open mouth, my ears, peers into my eyes. I jump when he palms my skull, presses down onto the plates of my head, rubs across my closed eyes. I keep them shut when his hand works its way from my crown to my neck and crawls downward, a walnut-knuckled, pale spider. “Delicate features from some admixture. She shows no marks from childbearing. Slender waist,” the doctor murmurs. “And wide hips.” The head-wrapped woman scribbles his notes, her gaze fixed to the page. “Would probably sell best as a fancy girl,” he says. I imagine myself like Aza, floating above the head-wrapped woman, above the doctor, above the little worms of pain burrowing into me with the doctor’s fingers as he works them over me, into me, into sleeves and pockets ever more tender, even softer. But knowing that my mama endured this, and worse, snaps me back, back into my body. For all the fighting she knew, she prized, she could not rebuke this. Oh, Mama.  One of the men leads me back to the low brick building. It is hot and close, and I want to warn Phyllis before she follows the same man back out, tell her of the woman, the thin doctor, his stabbing hands. But I can’t. I sit next to her and hug myself, every part of me wet: my head, my face, down the middle of my shoulder blades, my stomach, my wrists, between my legs where the doctor probed, and down to my red, open feet. I lean into the wall. I squint against the sharp threads of daylight coming in at the seams; there are etchings in the brick. Some letters. A shape that looks like a sun. And further down, a straight long line with a little triangle across the top. I touch it, trace it; it looks like a spear. I wonder if my mother might have carved this, put her mark here since she could never write her name. I wonder if she left this for me. When Phyllis returns, she tilts to a fall next to me. Her sobs, soft as they are, come out of her like pulled teeth. I wait for her to still, and then I take the ivory awl from my hair, from where it is hidden in my scalp, from where I have worn it every day since my mother was taken, and I scrape into the wall next to the mark that could be my mother’s. I scratch a circle, draw a straight line down the center of it, and then draw a little oval on one side of the circle, and on the other side, another: wings. When I squint, it could be a bee. We are awake when the next white man comes to the squat building, unlocks the door, and directs us into the courtyard, where he lines us up before the seller, the short blotchy man laden with gold over his big-knuckled hands. The doctor stands off to the side with the woman who looks like us. Phyllis, next to me, crosses her arms over her stomach, as if she could protect her soft parts, those parts not bound by bone. The woman at the end of the line is short, shorter than most of us but muscled where the rest of us are thin as ribbon. The seller stands in front of the first woman and reaches out, grabbing her face. “You a full hand. If a buyer asks, you say, ‘Yes, sir.’ ” The doctor writes. “Don’t, and you’ll be lashed. Understand?” The woman trembles, shivering like a horse run too long. Then she nods. The seller moves down the line, studies each woman’s arms, fingers, legs, and back before speaking. “You a lady’s maid,” he tells a woman with one drooping eye. “You a prime hand,” he tells the big woman. “You a sick nurse,” he tells another who lurches with a limp. “You a child’s nurse,” he tells another with knotted hair falling down her back. “You a cook,” he tells the one whom the walk didn’t pare to nothing. “You a seamstress,” he tells Phyllis. She doesn’t even nod; her chin falls into her chest. “And you …” He brushes one knuckle up my arm. “You don’t speak,” he says. “The buyers’ll know.” He echoes the doctor, telling me that I am a fancy girl, my only worth between my legs. A finger of fog curls over his head, encircles it, and grows fat. Aza rises from it. She shines in the sun: river water lit from above. Her arms hang loosely from her sides, and her mouth moves. “See,” Aza says, and points to the seller’s back, where there is a flame, narrow as a candle, in the air. The thief moves to the next woman, speaks to her, but his words are muffled. The flame blooms to a fire. A molten head rises from it, then shoulders, then a torso, then a blazing gown. The face turns dark, and a nose appears, then a mouth, and then eyes. The spirit’s hair is a conflagration. Her head and shoulders crackle with definition, her visage a log fire, banked and blackened. Hovering over the man, over all of us, is a smoldering cloud of a woman, a burning spirit. “See,” Aza says. “She Who Remembers.” The seller steps to the next woman in our sad line and tells her how she will be sold. The blazing spirit flexes her arms, which have turned black as her face. The seams in the wood of her forearms curl and move, form lines, form script. The fire at her heart slides into words. These words flow up her arms, over the hills of her shoulders, and into the valley of her black, black mouth. “She is the witness to your suffering, to all suffering,” Aza says. “She witnesses and remembers. That is her power.” The other spirit crackles and spits embers as the accounting scrolls up her arms, over her face, her whole body, only to disappear and make way for more as the women of our line nod at their narratives. “This world makes us all anew. Calls new spirits, feeds the old. Gives us followers, offerings,” Aza says. “Us a piece,” she says. From the KING issue: Jesmyn Ward on how racism is “built into the very bones” of Mississippi I clench my hands, as if I could choke the seller’s words back into his mouth, back down his throat. I look over the other women in the line, past Aza, to the spirit who remembers. She looks back, her gaping mouth swallowing the last word, and smoke rises from her. There, the smell of an old fire, an ancient fire, a fire prodded and fed and blazed and stoked for generations. I wish I could speak; I want to ask Aza: What she going to do with it? What her remembering going to do? Aza’s fog obscures her hands, her arms, her gown, her neck, until all of her is wreathed, and with a crack, she disappears. She Who Remembers looks down at me, and her legs disintegrate, then her hips, her torso, her arms, and last, her face, all of it raining ash. I would bury the awl in this short man’s eye. This story was adapted from Jesmyn Ward’s novel, Let Us Descend, published in October 2023. It appears in the November 2023 print edition with the headline “She Who Remembers.” "

        "story": "The day was cold, cold even for August in San Francisco. As Lionel walked over the Lefty O’Doul Bridge, the wind seemed to be coming from every direction—the Pacific, the bay, the brackish creek underfoot. And with every step, Lionel’s left shoe squeaked, an especially maddening thing, given that he’d just had them resoled. For years he’d passed a subterranean shoemaker’s shop, thinking it would be old-timey and fun to engage the ancient Romanian proprietor in some project. Finally Lionel had entered the man’s tiny shop and asked him to resole his favorite leather shoes, so soft they felt like moccasins. The whole encounter had been as quaint and satisfying as expected, until Lionel retrieved the shoes a week later and found that the left one now let out a cartoonish squeak with every footfall. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. When Lionel went back to the shoemaker, the old man shrugged. “Some shoes squeak,” he said. Lionel had learned to walk on the edge of his left foot. This decreased the sound, but gave him a worrying gait. People at the stadium had begun asking him about it. Lionel covered the Giants for the Examiner—the home games at least. The paper didn’t have the budget to send him on the road. The season was effectively over anyway; the team had no chance at the playoffs, and the mood in the clubhouse was dour. Not that the players were so garrulous in winning, either. Sydney Coletti saw to that. Brought in to head the media-relations department, she’d drilled the players on verbal discipline, and day after day, they dispensed word clusters that made sense but said nothing: “Trying to contribute.” “Just focused on getting the win.” “Great team effort.” “Happy to be here.” Sydney strode around the stadium in beautiful suits, sunglasses embedded in her raven hair. As if aware of her imperious affect, she often brought in treats—candy, cupcakes, huge bars of artisanal chocolate. She was polished and warm, but had no qualms about limiting access if a reporter crossed her. So Lionel had traded candor for access, and loathed himself for it. “Nice work, Lionel,” Sydney said when she approved of something he’d written. It was a terrible thing, to be praised this way. “Get me sticky,” Lionel’s editor, Warren, demanded. The problem was that when a player said something even vaguely sticky—Warren’s word for memorable, colorful, controversial—the sportswriters pounced, and often the player paid the price. Apologies followed, and lost endorsement deals, diminished love from fickle fans, a requested trade, a new team. That, or a player could just keep his mouth shut. Squeak, squeak, squeak. Lionel entered at the stadium’s media gate and made his way through the dim hallways to the locker room, where he showed his lanyard to Gregorio, the security guard. “Hannah beat you,” he said. “Beat me how?” Lionel said, thinking it could be any of 10, 12 ways. There she was, interviewing Hector Jiménez. Hannah Tanaka was technically his competition, in that she wrote for the Chronicle, the larger of the two valiant locals. But from the time he’d started on the Giants beat, she’d done everything humanly possible to help Lionel—introducing him to every staffer at the stadium, sharing every tip and data point—and he’d quickly fallen in love with her. She was so steady, so funny; her laugh was raspy, almost lewd. Squeak, squeak, squeak. She turned when she heard him. She had her notebook out, and her phone—she had some transcription app that converted everything a player said to text, instantly—but she looked at Lionel and smirked. That smirk! Good lord. She was married, though, and had two teenage girls, and so every year Lionel had gotten better at disguising his heartache. During the games, they sat next to each other, bantering, complaining, comparing notes, and with every word she said, in her low, clenched-jaw way, he was stung by the great injustice of finding his favorite person, sitting next to her every day, but heading home each day alone. Lionel looked around. He could talk to the second baseman, Hollis, who had some kind of problem with his heel, but what was the point? Warren wouldn’t give him space for news of another almost-injury to a player on a losing team. Hannah finished with Jiménez and sidled up to Lionel. “Behold the new guy,” she said, and nodded to a gangly man in the corner. She handed Lionel the day’s media packet and pointed to the relevant paragraph about a middle reliever, Nathan Couture, being called up from AAA Sacramento. “Get him before Sydney puts the muzzle on,” Hannah said. The man in the corner was holding the sleeves of his uniform apart, apparently dumbfounded to find his own name, COUTURE, stitched to the back of a Giants jersey. “Nathan?” Lionel asked. The pitcher turned around and smiled. His teeth were small, and he was missing his left canine; it gave him a look of youthful incompletion. He had a narrow, pockmarked face and a weak chin. A wispy mustache overhung his stern, chapped lips. “First time in the majors?” Lionel asked. “Indeed,” Nathan said. That word—it wasn’t heard so much in a locker room. Lionel wrote “indeed” in his notebook, and then asked the most inane, and most common, query in sports. “How does it feel?” It hurt to utter the words. But Nathan nodded and inhaled and exhaled expansively through his nostrils, as if this was the most provocative question he’d ever heard. “When I got the call, just yesterday, I was elated,” Nathan said. Lionel heard an accent. Rural. Southeastern maybe. Georgia? He wrote down “Elated” and underlined it. “The drive from Sacramento was a fever dream,” Nathan continued. “The scenery rushed by like meltwater. And then to get here, to this cathedral, to warm up, and to meet these men at the top of their craft”—he swept his arm around the room, now filled with a dozen or so players in towels and jockstraps; one was jiggling his leg, as if to awaken it—“and to be welcomed by them without condition, and now to see my name on this shirt … I have to say, it’s sublime.” Lionel wrote and underlined “sublime.” He looked around to see if he was being pranked. But no one was listening; no one was near. “I’m sorry, I didn’t get your name,” Nathan said, and extended his hand. Lionel introduced himself, and found that Nathan was examining his face with a friendly but jarring intensity. He rested his eyes on Lionel’s notebook. “Do you take shorthand?” he asked. Lionel’s handwriting was a chaotic mix of cursive and all caps—a madman’s scrawl. “No, no,” he said. “This is just my personal code, I guess.” In four years, no player had ever asked even the vaguest question about Lionel’s process or profession. “I assume you’ll call me a journeyman,” Nathan said. Lionel had just written that exact word. He quickly crossed it out. “Don’t, don’t,” Nathan said. “I like the word, and for me it’s apt. And removed from baseball, it’s a good word, don’t you think? Journey-man. I know not everyone loves it, since it implies a kind of purgatory just below success, but in isolation, the word has a simple beauty to it, right? How could you not want to be called a journey-man?” Lionel looked at the word he’d obliterated. “I guess so.” He circled it. When he glanced up again, Nathan was looking down at him with priestly interest. “Did you dream of this work as a boy?” he asked. Lionel couldn’t speak. He returned to the assumption that this was a prank. He looked around. No one looked back. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t probe like that,” Nathan said, and laid a hand on Lionel’s shoulder. “I just had the sudden awareness that the two of us are in the enviable, even surreal position of living out our most impossible dreams. The fact that we aren’t digging ditches or mining coal—that I’m paid to play a game and you’re paid to watch a game and tell people what you see—it seems, in a world of sadness and misfortune, to be a thing of great luck. Don’t you think?” Lionel watched the game in a daze. He sat in the press box, Hannah on his right. On his left was Marco DaSilva, in his mid-20s, round-shouldered and stat-obsessed, and for some reason doing AM radio, where the average listener was 76. Lionel read, and reread, his notes, while hoping Nathan Couture would be called in to pitch. “Interesting guy?” Hannah asked. “His numbers are shit,” Marco said. It was not right to withhold anything from them, but Lionel kept the strange interview to himself. The Giants lost badly and Nathan didn’t play, and somewhere along the way, Hannah, bored by Lionel’s distracted state, moved to sit next to Marco, and made a show of having an especially good time with this new seating arrangement. Lionel wrote up the game, but because Nathan hadn’t been a factor, it made no sense to include him. He’d play sooner or later, Lionel figured, at which point he could get him into a story. Maybe Warren would let him do a profile. Or maybe not. Warren didn’t generally like human-interest stories. That night, Lionel went online, searching for Nathan Couture. His hometown was Thomasville, Alabama. He was 28 and had never been to college. His statistics were unremarkable in every way, which meant he was unlikely to remain in the majors for any stretch of time. He was both average and old. A mediocre pitcher who was happy to be in the bigs, and who asked about Lionel’s work and method? What was he thinking? Nathan was sent back to Sacramento the next day. Lionel wrote up his summaries of the games that week, printing the players’ inanities, and Sydney baked white-chocolate brownies, which were exceptional. “I don’t like her baking, actually,” Marco said. He and Hannah and Lionel were watching batting practice on another cool August afternoon. “Her cookies are brittle,” Hannah said. Lionel hadn’t thought about Sydney’s cookies that way before, but they were definitely on the crumbly side. Soon the three of them had turned on all the food in the stadium. The garlic fries, which had been so crisp last season, were now less crisp, and the little pepperonis on the pizzas had dropped a few notches. “Remember when they were sort of curly?” Lionel asked. The gates of complaint were now open. The architects of the park, they agreed, had not allotted enough elevators, so the writers often had to wait—sometimes many minutes—to get from the field to the press box. “And the paper towels!” Marco said suddenly, tragically. In the bathrooms closest to the press box, the paper-towel dispensers had been replaced by air dryers, which they all agreed were too loud. “Well,” Marco said, his voice weary, “I guess we should go inside and get the lineup for tonight.” Lionel grabbed the copy Sydney had put in his cubby and saw Nathan’s name. He felt a flutter of excitement that embarrassed him. “Couture is back,” Hannah said, and Lionel nodded, giving away nothing. The game began, and by the sixth inning, with the Giants up 5–0, it was highly unlikely they would need Nathan. He was the third or fourth middle reliever on the roster, and the starter was still soaring. But the Padres hacked a series of singles into shallow left and right, and suddenly it was 5–3, then 5–4. The manager made his way to the mound and took the ball, and the starter walked to the dugout, head low and muttering. Lionel looked to the bullpen to see who would emerge. When Nathan stepped out, he waited on the warning track, taking a long breath. He walked onto the grass like it was the first step of a royal staircase, and then broke into a steady trot. The rest of his entrance and preparations were routine. He kicked the dirt and took his warm-up pitches. His face appeared on the massive outfield screen, in a goofy photo, and 20,000 fans wondered, idly, who he was. Then, without fuss, he struck out the first batter with three pitches. “Damn,” Marco said, and typed feverishly for a while. Lionel assumed he was looking for some numerical context for what had just happened. The next batter hit a rope toward left. Winebrenner, the third baseman, knocked it down but bobbled it, and there was a runner on first. When the third man up hit a dribbler to second, Hollis fielded it—clumsily—and flipped it to the shortstop, who stepped on second and threw to first for a double play. “Okay,” Hannah said. “Okay.” For Hannah, this was high praise. Next inning, Nathan took care of the first three batters in much the same way—with crafty pitch selection and pinpoint placement. When the third hitter fouled a ball high, Nathan ran after it, briefly confusing the first baseman, who waved him off and caught it. Between innings, Hannah took a cryptic call. “Huh,” she said. Apparently Hollis, the second baseman, was getting an MRI. The heel that had been bothering him was now shot. Something had happened during that double play. “Is that corny?” Nathan asked. “I wanted to savor it a bit longer.” Hollis seesawed into the room on crutches and the reporters swarmed. The professional thing to do would be to go over and hear from the player who’d won four Gold Gloves and was being paid $12 million. But Lionel stayed with Nathan. “I noticed you paused when you first stepped out,” he said. “I did,” Nathan said. “I assume you want to know how it felt?” Lionel smiled and licked the tip of his pen theatrically. “It was big,” Nathan said. Lionel wrote down “It’s big” and for a moment, he wondered if Nathan’s earlier eloquence had been a fluke. “Kidding, Lionel. Truly, I think it’s a happy, wholly irrational spectacle,” he said. “Don’t you think? I mean—” “Hold on,” Lionel said, and scrambled for his tape recorder. Nathan took a deep breath. “I mean, those upper-deck seats are probably 200 feet up. Think of it. Twenty-five thousand people were here tonight, some of them sitting 200 feet in the air, to see men play as silly a game as has ever been conjured. Balls and bats and bases—all of it perfected and professionalized, sure, but essentially childish and irrelevant. And to serve it, to celebrate it, this billion-dollar coliseum is built. People come 100 miles to watch it under 1,000 lights. When you and I first met, it was a day game, a completely different atmosphere. At night the stadium takes on the look of deep space. The sky is so black, the lights so white, illuminating a surreal sea of green. When you jog out there, as I did, in the dark, it feels, briefly, like you’re in a spaceship, approaching a new planet.” Hector Jiménez, the catcher whose locker was next to Nathan’s, had begun listening, and was giving Nathan a disapproving look. “There was some confusion over that foul ball,” Lionel said, and already Nathan was nodding. “First of all,” he said, “that ball was rightfully Gutierrez’s, but it started out over my head, and that northeast wind took it toward the first-base line. So I had it in my sights, but then it evaporated. I mean, it ceased to be!” Lionel caught Jiménez’s eye. He looked alarmed, horrified. “And for a long moment,” Nathan continued, “as I searched the void for the ball, I thought, I’ve caught a million balls. How could I lose this one? And then I thought, Why am I here? Where are my legs? Are my arms still raised? Why can’t I see? The sky was so black, and this solid thing, this baseball, had utterly disappeared in it! So I wondered if the ball had been real, and if I was real, if anything was real.” Jiménez tossed his gear into his duffel and zipped it loudly. “Then I smelled roast beef!” Nathan said, and laughed loudly, placing his hand on Lionel’s shoulder. “I thought, Is that roast beef I smell? Who brought roast beef to the ballpark? Then Gutierrez yelled, ‘Move, kid, I got it!’ and my eyes swung toward him. As they did, I saw the blur of 1,000 faces in the stands beyond first. Then he caught the ball.” Jiménez walked away. Seconds later, Sydney appeared. She always grew suspicious when interviews ran long. “Everything good over here?” she asked. “Fine,” Lionel said, but the interview was over. Lionel had to wait a few days for the drama of Hollis’s injury to play out before asking Warren for some space in the paper to profile Nathan. Warren had zero interest in it, especially since Nathan hadn’t played again. But then one day an ad dropped out, so on page 23, Lionel was allotted six column inches to introduce “Nathan Couture, Pitcher With Unique Outlook.” He did little more than print the two long quotes he’d gotten from Nathan before Sydney had hustled him away, but the article made an impression. “You have to play me that tape,” Hannah said, clearly dubious. All the reporters wanted to talk to Nathan, but Nathan was suddenly unavailable. Sydney felt they’d dodged a bullet in having this eccentric Alabaman talk and talk and somehow avoid a catastrophic mistake. She would not risk it again. But then she said she would. “The owner insisted on it,” Warren said. The octogenarian owner of the team had evidently read Lionel’s article, and was an immediate fan of Nathan’s. He wanted Nathan in games, and wanted Nathan to talk, as much as he could, before and after games. The owner, viewed as an eccentric himself (though from Kansas), was assumed to be not long for this world. Three days after Nathan’s first outing, he pitched the eighth inning of another tight game, and again he held his own, and the Giants won. This time, he had to bat, and actually stroked a line drive into Triples Alley. Against the wishes of the first-base coach, Nathan rounded first base and was easily tagged out at second. It made for a comical and eventful inning, and the home crowd went berserk. Afterward, a scrum of reporters surrounded him, and Lionel, who had unwisely waited for the elevator, found himself in the third ring. He felt oddly proprietary, even jilted. He wanted, to a degree that filled him with shame, some kind of acknowledgment from Nathan that he was different, that he had been first. Nathan looked around and smiled broadly. “Well, this is extraordinary.” Hannah was closest. “General thoughts, Mr. Couture?” Nathan stared at the ceiling for a while, as if peeling back the many layers of the query, then rested his eyes upon her. “First I thought about the smell of the grass,” he said. “They cut it today, so the smell was fresh and just a bit sour, as newly cut grass is. There’s something both wet and dry at the same time, both dead and alive. I inhaled a bit longer than usual, wanting to take everything in, and I saw four men, all gray-haired, arm in arm in the stands, posing for a picture. Then the Jumbotron showed a picture of the same men, as teenagers, at a ball game. Same four guys, same pose, just 50-odd years ago. And I had the feeling that the four of them, whenever they stand side by side like that, probably feel invincible.” “Nathan, I—” Another reporter broke in, thinking Nathan was finished. But Lionel knew he wasn’t. “Then I saw a seagull. Maybe you did too? It hovered over home plate for a moment, maybe 20 feet up. Under the lights it looked like a tiny angel. I wondered what brought this bird, alone, to the ballpark. No doubt he hoped he might come across some discarded chips or fries, but the risk is considerable, too. Wouldn’t the lights, and 30,000 people, be daunting? But then again, he can fly. Is anything daunting when you can fly? And briefly I thought about the nature of flight. I do think there will come a time when humans can fly more or less as birds do, and I wondered how that would affect our idea of freedom. Will anyone ever feel constrained, spiritually or materially, if they can fly?” Lionel wrote down “If we can fly.” “And then it was time to pitch,” Nathan said. There was scattered laughter, and the exchange of looks. Nathan was stranger in person than he had been in Lionel’s article. A dozen hands went up. “Oh jeez,” Nathan said. “I just went on and on. And you probably have so many other players to talk to. Why don’t we do a speed round? Deal?” Someone in front asked, “What was it like to get your first hit?” “If you remember,” Nathan said, “I fouled off the first two pitches. And fouling a ball off is like every mistake you make in life: You put everything you’ve got into a task, and if it’s just a little wrong, it’s wrong enough to make the whole effort a waste of time. The ball goes nowhere, or worse than nowhere. But when the barrel of the wooden bat hits the ball just so—you feel nothing. There’s no resistance. Nothing at all. The ball leaps into the sky. The struggle is gone.” Marco edged in. “Nathan, the average spin rate of your four-seamer is solid, at 2320, putting you ninth among middle relievers, but tonight, your average for the last three batters was 2090. Do you have a plan to address that?” As Marco talked, Nathan’s face slackened, his eyes glazed, and when Marco was finished, he said, “Honestly, Marco, I have no ever-loving idea.” A balding man in a baby-blue sweat suit raised his hand. It was Tom Verlo, from the L.A. Times. He’d likely come upstate to throw a bit of cold water on San Francisco’s new attraction. “Can you tell us about running?” he asked. “You looked a bit rusty.” “Was it as bad as I’m thinking it was?” Nathan said, and flashed an enormous and spectacularly awkward smile. “You know, as natural as it was when I hit that ball, running was the opposite. I felt like I was running in 1,000-year-old armor. By the time I got to second, the ball was in the second baseman’s glove. He was waiting for me like a groom would a bride. When he tagged me out, I was so relieved, I wanted to fall into his arms.” Tom smiled. “On the broadcast, it looked like he said something to you.” “He did. He said, ‘Mijo, now you can rest.’ ” Nathan looked at the clock on the wall. “We should hurry. Superspeed round now.” “What does it sound like when a ball is caught?” a young web reporter asked. “When I was a kid in Alabama, my grandfather lived in the backyard, in a little cottage. Every night after dinner, I would walk back to his place with him, and he would kiss me on the crown of my head and say, ‘Adieu.’ Then he would close the door, and the sound of his door closing would be a muffled, wet, and decisive click. That’s what it sounds like when a ball is caught. Like the click of the door to my grandfather’s home.” Nathan looked at the clock. “Okay, one last one? I see you, Lionel.” Lionel, standing in the back, was happy for Nathan, and for the moment felt unnecessary. He shook his head. That was the game, and the interview, that broke Nathan Couture into the national media. The next day, and for the following week, he was everywhere. ESPN did a segment, and Jimmy Kimmel had him on his show. With Sydney offering Nathan freely to all, the only thing Lionel could do was go to Phoenix. Nathan’s parents, though they’d raised Nathan in Alabama, had moved to Arizona, and Warren green-lit a longer profile. In a stolen moment before a game, Lionel told Nathan he was thinking of going, and Nathan gave his blessing. “I trust you,” he said. “Thank you,” Lionel said. “You report accurately and you listen carefully,” he said. “I try,” Lionel said. “They are tremendous people,” Nathan said. “Immeasurably charming. You’ll love them, and they you. I’m envious that you get to see them. I’ll call ahead and let them know I vouch for you.” Lionel arrived at a comfortable ranch house 20 minutes from downtown Phoenix. A pickup truck was out front, and next to it, a small fishing boat rested on a trailer. Lionel rang the bell, and when the door opened, a thin couple in their late 60s stood before him, arms around each other’s waists. Jim and Dot, short for Dorothy. “Lionel,” Jim said. “I took the liberty of pouring you a glass of ice water,” Dot said. Lionel followed them in. He walked on the side of his left foot, but the squeaking was clearly audible. Lionel guessed, correctly, that they would be too polite to mention it. “Come sit,” Jim said, and indicated a plush leather recliner in the living room. It was almost surely Jim’s TV chair, and Lionel took the honor given. Nathan’s parents sat to his right, on a matching couch. “Nathan speaks highly of you,” Dot said. “He does,” Jim agreed. Lionel got his notebook out and looked around the room. He’d expected a house full of books, but saw few. There were no trophies, either—no shrine to their son, the professional baseball player. An enormous TV dominated one wall. Next to it were two photos, from middle school, he guessed. One was clearly Nathan. The other was a girl, younger by a year or two, who shared a version of Nathan’s goofy smile. But there was something knowing, even sardonic, in her eyes. “So how does it feel,” Lionel asked, “with Nathan becoming this …” He almost said “curiosity” but instead chose “phenomenon.” “Oh, it’s been so nice,” Dot said. “He worked hard,” Jim said. “Deserves it.” Lionel smiled, thinking they were warming up. But they were done. Dot held her glass of water with two hands and smiled at Lionel in a motherly way. Lionel looked down at his notebook. “So outside his skill as a pitcher,” he said, “one of the things that’s gotten Nathan noticed is his way with words. Was he always loquacious?” Dot winced. She looked to Jim. Jim chewed his cheek. “I read your first article,” Dot said. “When you had him saying ‘Indeed,’ right away I thought, That’s the comebacker.” She pointed to her temple. “He was never, you know, book smart,” Jim added. “That was his sister.” “Never read a book unless you tied him down,” Dot said. “He didn’t talk a whole lot,” Jim said, “and when he did, he did it in a regular way. He was all laser-focused. That’s how his coaches described him.” “Single-minded. Then the comebacker happened,” Dot said. “I’m sorry. The comebacker?” Lionel asked. “Well, he was hit by a comebacker,” Jim said, sounding surprised that Lionel didn’t know. “In Sacramento. It was on the radio up there.” “We were at the game,” Dot said. “It was awful. Nathan threw a fastball to a very big guy, I think he was from Nevada, and this guy hit the ball right back at him a million miles an hour. Hit him right here.” Again she pointed to her temple. “From our angle, it looked awful,” Jim amended. “But later we saw it on tape, and it was more of a … It sorta grazed his head. The doctor checked him out and said he was okay. Nathan felt okay too. He pitched the rest of the inning and did fine. But then he took us out for dinner afterward, and it was like talking to some other person.” “He had a $10 word for everything,” Jim said. “He said the wine was ‘unafraid.’ I remember that. The wine was ‘unafraid.’ That was new.” “He did say that. He said a lot of things,” Dot said. “He talked a lot that night,” Jim added. “We flew home the next morning, and a few days later, he gets called up to the Giants. Which is when you met him.” “We figured the new way of talking was some temporary thing,” Dot said. “But then your article comes out, and he’s still talking this way—‘indeed’ this and ‘glorious’ that.” “His sister talked like that. She was the reader.” Lionel was afraid to ask. “She passed young,” Dot said, and leaned forward, her hands on her knees. “It was a tumor. When they found it, it was too big.” Jim cleared his throat. “Anyway. With Nathan, when he was talking like that, we put it together. It had to be the comebacker.” Dot was nodding steadily, her eyes locked on Lionel. “Like something got knocked loose, and whatever was clogged up in there came pouring out. Sometimes people get hit in the head and start speaking another language.” Jim nodded enthusiastically. “French, Portuguese, Turkish. But it seems like it’s usually French.” By the time Lionel left, the impossible heat of paved Arizona had relented. He drove with the windows open, the red sunset behind him. He got back to the hotel and checked his messages. One was from Hannah. “Sorry about your boy,” she said. “You probably know more than I do. Call if you want to compare notes.” Lionel looked online and found a short blip about it. Nathan had been pitching in Cleveland when he blew out his arm. He left the park in a sling. The professional thing for Lionel to do would be to return to Nathan’s parents’ home and get their reaction. But he couldn’t bring himself to bother them, and was so shattered that he sat on the bed and stared at the wall for the better part of an hour. Finally he got to his feet and drove his rental car to the airport. Back in San Francisco, Lionel waited for news. For two days Nathan wasn’t at the park, and no one had updates. Finally a press conference was called. The room was full. Lionel sat at the back. The team doctor came out and said they’d done an MRI and consulted with the best specialists in the city. Nathan would need surgery, and even after that, the prognosis was not good. “I can’t promise anything,” the doctor said. And then Nathan walked in, wearing a coat and tie, his arm in a sling. He sat down. He looked warmly out at the throng of reporters, but before he could begin, Tom from the L.A. Times walked in late. “What’s the prognosis?” he asked. The room groaned, but as always, Nathan treated the question with great decorum. “If I were still 18,” he said, “I might be able to get the surgery. Then, in 10 or 12 months, I could return, though with reduced capacity. But I’m almost 30, so there is no way back. Even if I did every last thing right, I’d be, at best, a single-A player. And an old one at that.” Hannah was in the front row. She raised her hand. “Hi, Hannah,” Nathan said. “I’m guessing you’d like to know how it feels?” She laughed and lowered her hand. “It’s a good question. At the moment, I’m still stunned. Numb. I have to admit my imagination had gotten away from me, and I saw great glory ahead. I was looking forward to the rest of the season, to seasons to come, to the lights, all those people sitting 200 feet in the sky to watch this game. It’s over sooner than I expected, for sure. So for the moment, I’m adrift. Don’t you cry now, Hannah.” He looked around the table for tissues. “All we have up here is water. Here,” he said, and poured her a tall glass from the pitcher. And as he did, time slowed. Every reporter in the room watched closely, as if they’d never before seen water move from one vessel to another. Nathan sat down again, and called on Lionel. “Did you have any warning?” Lionel asked. “You know, my friend, I really didn’t. I felt good that day in Cleveland. But it’s probably like any other thing. How can a sequoia withstand a thousand years of earthquakes and fires and wind, and finally, one day, it just falls? One afternoon, a gust comes and it gives up.” Nathan stood. “I’ll miss you all. Hope I see you here or there or somewhere in between. Goodbye now.” Lionel walked onto King Street, trying to figure out how to shape the story, or if he should bother. He still hadn’t written about his time with Nathan’s parents; his heart wasn’t in it. When he turned the corner at Third Street, heading home, he felt a presence next to him. “Caught up to you!” It was Nathan, out of breath. “I tried to find you at the park, and then was wandering around the neighborhood, hoping to run into you. I know you live around here. Then I heard the squeaking.” They ducked into a burrito place. Lionel tried to order margaritas for them both, but Nathan declined. “I don’t know why my mind is working the way it does now, but I don’t want to mess with it.” He ordered a lemonade. Lionel ordered a lemonade too, and they sat by the window facing the park. “Your parents told me about the comebacker,” he said. “Yeah, I figured,” Nathan said. “Funny thing is, I don’t feel different, and I don’t see differently than I ever did before. I’ve always noticed the same things, but I guess that now I have the need, and maybe the words, to describe it. “My sister was the eloquent one,” he continued after a pause. “My parents mention her?” “A little bit,” Lionel said. For a second Nathan smiled, as if thinking of her, of something she’d said. “Anyway,” he said, “I’ll be reading you, making sure you get it right.” “I can do better,” Lionel said suddenly, and Nathan did not argue the point. It was criminal to sit in that park, Lionel thought, with all that color, all that vaulting joy in a world of sadness and misfortune, and not do better. “You plan to fix the squeak?” Nathan asked. “I took it back to the shoe guy,” Lionel said, “but he freed himself of any responsibility.” “Can I?” Nathan asked, and Lionel took off his shoe and handed it to Nathan. “It has to be an air pocket, right?” Nathan said. Even with one bum arm, he quickly found the pocket and aimed a fork at it. “Can I?” he asked again. Lionel nodded, and Nathan jabbed a strategic hole. “Try it now.” Lionel put the shoe back on and walked a few steps. The squeak was gone. His relief was immeasurable. “Thank you,” he said. They finished their lemonades and stepped back into the city. The lights were on in the stadium. Lionel had forgotten there was a home game that night. He turned to Nathan, thinking he’d be wistful, but his eyes were sharp and happy. “So what will you do now?” Lionel asked. “I’ve been thinking about that. Are you walking this way?” Nathan was heading toward the water, his gait loose. Lionel followed. “Maybe you buy that Romanian shoemaker out.” Nathan laughed. “You know,” he said, “a few years ago, I was in a high-rise in Guangzhou, visiting a friend at his office. Long story. But anyway, this was 42 floors up, and there was a man outside, cleaning the windows. He had one of those wide T-shaped tools for cleaning the glass—like a blade. You know the tool. So simple. He drenched the window with soap, applying it with such liberality. Just soaked this vast window overlooking this limitless city.” Nathan turned to the towers of downtown San Francisco. “And then, with the T-shaped blade, he slashed the surface of the glass with the precision and finality of a guillotine. He got every last white sud. As we watched, the view through the window went from muddy to crystalline.” Lionel couldn’t figure out what the connection was. Nathan wanted to be a businessman in a Chinese high-rise? And how had this minor-league pitcher from Alabama ended up with a friend in Guangzhou? “So I thought I’d like to do that job,” Nathan said. He meant cleaning the windows. “Not necessarily in Guangzhou, and not forever, but I’d like to try that for a while. I like being outside.” They’d arrived at the water, and Lionel thought he should get back to the ballpark. He reached out to shake Nathan’s hand. Nathan lowered his sling and took Lionel’s fingers in his. “Or babies!” he said, still pumping Lionel’s hand. “You know how after babies are born in hospitals, there are nurses who hold the babies while the moms recover from the birth? How do you get that job?” Nathan released Lionel’s hand and began backing away, toward the South Beach marina, where hundreds of white masts looked like lances aimed at the night. “Imagine holding babies all day!” Nathan said. “Wouldn’t that be a worthwhile life? So tomorrow I’m going down to the maternity ward to find out who gets to hold the babies. I want to hold all those babies before they go home.”"

        "story": "Everything overheard in those days. German on the streets, my mother and my father on the phone. They’re only children. My mother, Philip, and I: three bodies stuck inside the bright-yellow cage of a phone booth. He was in Bosnia on assignment. Assigned to what? We didn’t know. We were only children. We knew far away; we knew war-torn; we knew 10 days, maybe two weeks, maybe more. We knew we had moved to Berlin earlier that summer and turned a page we could no longer turn back. The flight home to Toronto was a year away, a lifetime in our little lives. By August I’d stopped wishing for the rec center and its too-chlorinated pool, for the park near our house and the counselors who brought us there, those miraculously stoned 14-year-olds, letting us climb on the monkey bars and making us necklaces out of marigolds and calling it “camp.” I missed my best friend Eva, but not as much as I’d thought. And even when I missed her, I liked it, my missing, this nothing the same anymore, this everything suddenly in the past tense. I had been made for the habit of missing, living out of a single suitcase with the same four T-shirts and two pairs of soccer shorts, the one jean dress, which I wore only because it made my mother smile, the same way she smiled when she looked at herself in the mirror, a smile equal measures modesty and conceit. The smile of a discerning woman. I lived for those smiles, the rare exception of them; we all did. It was my brother, Philip, 18 months older, who had a hard time of it. He would turn 13 that summer but had started wetting his bed like a much younger boy. Not every night, no, but once and then again and then again. Back at home, I might have let myself enjoy it, even gloat a little. He who could do nothing wrong, he who had been everyone’s favorite, my mother’s particular pet. But here, instead, I sat on the foldout chair in the kitchen of the cavernous short-term-rental apartment and watched as my mother stuffed the soiled single sheet into the too-small washing machine and turned to me with her index finger to her lips, lifting her coal-dark eyebrows, and I thought about how I was being asked to keep a secret all the time now. One evening, waking up uneasy, aware of something happening just outside my reach—moving out of bed with the inevitability of a dream. My mother on the patio, cigarette in her mouth, like the movie star she was not. I let out a little yelp. Her words, their sound escaping my mouth, How could you? She looked surprised, although less alert than I would have thought; stubbed the cigarette out on the balcony railing, and came over to me, smelling of a stranger, cigarettes and something else, a new smell blossoming from somewhere deep. When she tucked me back in, she pointed to the other sliver of bed where my brother slept, his face contorted and red; Stumm, she whispered, our favorite German word. Our second secret. My brother’s bad habit and hers. She was training me, I was beginning to understand, to store them away. In the daytime, walking in the Tiergarten. My brother’s mouth pressed to the spout of a water fountain, my mother not even saying don’t. The junkies sitting around the entrance of the Zoologischer Garten, girls not much older than me, with their agitated German shepherds barking at their own tails. I asked my mother why the dogs were like that, and she told me fleas reflexively, and I thought about the tiniest facts and how adults accrued them, how many there were that I had yet to encounter. How would I ever catch up? Every evening, sharing an ice-cream cone from the Häagen-Dazs on Kurfürstendamm, my mother not even complaining about the tourist prices. With my father away, bills were dispensed from the neat stack in my mother’s wallet like a magic trick, ta-da, not a perpetual rummaging in deep pockets, coins jangling, my father’s nervous habit. You’re in Europe now, he’d warned us when we’d arrived at Tegel Airport. We needed to keep an eye on prices and remember the exchange rate, which could sneak up on us at any moment. My brother perked up then, literal-minded as he was, terrified of those calculations, the exponential dangers of being abroad. My father, before leaving on assignment, had even loaned him his cheap Casio calculator. No matter where we went, Philip set to converting the price of each purchase from deutsche marks into Canadian dollars, even though the currencies were nearly on par. How many phone conversations inside those yellow phone booths, with the playing-card-size ads for call girls papering every side? My mother calling Realtors in German that sounded like her native French—a language she had always kept from us—those guttural sounds made pert and pinched in her mouth. Breasts everywhere. In ads on the U-Bahn and plastered to buildings and construction fencing. The Beate Uhse Erotik Museum taking up an entire city block, with its displays of tasseled and G-stringed mannequins. One night, on our way back from ice cream, two women—girls, really—waiting in their miniskirts and go-go boots by a lamppost, their eyes surveying the road. I stopped and looked: a car slowing down, a beat-up shoebox with a man inside it with an ugly mustache, the woman looking to one side and then the other, and then her head dropping down to meet the mustache. A strangely elegant dance. My mother telling me, Don’t stare. I couldn’t tell if she disapproved of the scene, or if she didn’t want to make its actors feel uncomfortable. She didn’t seem to mind about anything in those days, or her minding was different, a kind of loose minding I’d always envied in other mothers. And then, not a secret anymore. She smoked continually, inside the house and in the café under the arches of Savignyplatz, where she drank not one, but two cappuccinos in a row, always identical in their stout white ceramic cup and saucer and delivered by a waiter in a tux. We must have made a funny trio: my mother and I, our hair dark as ink; my brother, a redhead like our father, with his little calculator, waving my mother’s smoke away. Hot chocolate mit Sahne in a glass mug for me, with its dollop of whipped cream floating luxuriously at the top. Philip ordered strictly Coca-Colas, refusing orange Fanta, which I knew he liked. He boycotted everything German, with his Canadian flag sewn onto his backpack. This was West Berlin. 1996. My mother not yet 35, the age I am now. We never went to the east in those days. Only my father went on assignment. Berlin had been reunified, but you couldn’t have guessed it from the way we lived. The few expats we’d been put in touch with all lived in the West. The John F. Kennedy Schule, where we would be attending fifth and sixth grade in September, was in the West, in leafy Zehlendorf.  My father had explained to us before we moved: He had been posted by his newspaper to track Berlin’s reconstruction, the country’s reunification. But I didn’t think the city needed rebuilding. It was beautiful, broken as it was. We had gone to see the Wall during our first week. Our father had briefed us before the visit, given us a loose chronology of the Cold War, shown us pictures from the fall: Berliners from the west and east dancing on the Wall’s thick lip. Fall seemed a passive word when it came to all those people wanting the same thing at the exact same time. Back at home, when we were alone together, my father spoke to me almost continuously. He spoke and I listened. On the way to dance class and soccer practice, on the way to the supermarket, and to sleepovers at Eva’s. He never seemed to mind that I was a child. He spoke to me the same way he spoke to his few adult friends, to the people he interviewed over the phone. I don’t think he knew how else to speak to me. He was the kind of parent who seemed perplexed by the lives of the young, as though he had never had a childhood. He retained facts with exquisite precision. It was odd, then, that he should love my mother, who appeared in her very nature like the opposite of a fact one might retain. Or maybe it was this—her counterfactuality—that had drawn him to her in the first place. When my father was with her, he spoke quietly, in a choppy and informational way. They did not argue, or if they did, did not allow us to overhear. But it was impossible not to notice the way her mood might shift irretrievably in his presence, the skin around her jaw tightening, the divot between her eyes deepening, her body becoming more rigid and upright—all of the physical cues she gave my father to keep his distance, his hushed compliance. I wished, in those moments, for my father to be a different kind of husband, one who might tease her, might take her out of herself, but I think he had a great respect for a person’s inborn right to her inborn seriousness. And there was complicity between them; I saw that too. The distance she demanded and his careful maintenance of it created a world unto itself, just large enough to house the two of them. We were waiting for our furniture and the rest of our clothes. We had packed light, hoping the shipping container would arrive in a few weeks. But it had been six now; the first apartment we’d planned to move into had fallen through. Fallen through what? And so we visited dozens of apartments. At first, the three of us: my mother, my brother, and I. When my brother said he’d had enough of snooping around other people’s stuff—It’s weird, he told us accusingly, as though we were enjoying it too much—my mother and I went alone. There were those apartments so emptied of life, so generic, that it was impossible to imagine reviving them with our presence. But there were also apartments so palatial, so bohemian, with their open-planned kitchens and proliferations of glass jars—delicate strands of black tea, swirls of pasta—so nakedly not ours. We spent a few days in Charlottenburg, seeing apartments there, but I knew that they were beyond the budget the newspaper had set. My mother, under the spell of the stately apartments, the ornate moldings, the high ceilings, acted as though money was of little concern, agreeing on the spot to move into a quiet apartment with a marble-counter-topped kitchen. But that evening, a rare fight erupted between my parents over the telephone, and the next day we had to bow out of the lease. Mein mann, my mother gave, in her rudimentary German, as an excuse. Mann meant “man” and “husband” at the same time. I found this strange, that one should imply the other. I had no intention, even then, of ever being anyone’s frau. Later, my mother picking clothes out for us at the C&A department store with her version of exuberance, moving easily through the aisles, plucking items off the rack. I loved my mother best in these moments, when I coasted on the wake of her decisiveness, her confident tastes. Cute, my mother said, when I came out of the changing room wearing a tight ribbed polo with white jean shorts. She arranged my collar, tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, very cute. Philip told me I looked weird, but when I asked him why, he said, You just do. Like a weirdo. He had always been sweet before, shielding me as best he could from the bullying I had endured in our middle school in Toronto. But he brooded all the time now. I could tell from the Turkish families and sturdy German grandmothers wearing floral housecoats that the store was not fancy. My mother loved to shop, but she only bought refined pieces for herself, keeping the habit of luxury her own. In our first week without my father, she had bought a pair of sunglasses for 175 Deutschmarks, followed by a silk blouse for 250. The boutique’s attendant, a young giraffe of a woman with a liar’s gap, had said, Sehr, sehr schön, commenting on my mother’s silhouette. My mother had looked in the full-length mirror in the way she did in those days, with a coy self-satisfaction that seemed like a secret she kept stored up only for herself. From time to time, after the purchase of the blouse, I would go to her room, find the stiff bag hanging behind the door, visit the crinkly paper, touch the shirt’s almost impossible weightlessness. I didn’t care about clothes; I cared about her, how she would look in them, how she would feel in them. She had told me, on the way back to the apartment, where my brother sat plastered to the couch watching a recorded episode of Melrose Place, not to tell him or my father about what she’d bought. Rainy days spent on the low couch watching the TV shows Eva had recorded for me onto VHS as a parting gift. Philip watching alongside, not even complaining that they were mostly soap operas. Mom reading and smoking on the balcony, not minding what we did. In the early afternoons, she went out and came back with groceries: supermarket potato salad and cold cuts for lunch and frozen pizzas and a salad for dinner, as if she had forgotten how to cook. At home, she had cooked every meal for us, garlic-stewed lamb sprinkled with immaculately chopped parsley, effortless salads bright with lemon and olive oil, nut cakes soaked in orange-blossom syrup, miraculously light, all recipes she’d learned from her Sephardic mother, my grandmother, whom my brother and I had met only twice—both visits so short, it had been impossible to glean more than the fact that she was opposite to my mother: loud, and thickset, and so aggressively affectionate that Philip had burst into tears when she’d squeezed him goodbye. When the apartment in Charlottenburg fell through, we stopped looking for a place to live. We’ll let your dad do the digging when he gets back, my mother said, with a wry lilt. I knew that our sublet was ending in just a couple of weeks, but I said nothing, following her lead, as I always did. My father had been gone for three weeks, nearly four, and we no longer counted down the days. At night, I heard my brother crying, and instead of asking him what was wrong, I let him. We were each, it seemed, in our new confinement, in our new closeness, entirely on our own. After the rain, a period of surprising heat. We peeled ourselves from the couch, took the U-Bahn to the Olympic swimming pool in Spandau. The place was packed with families. Bodies young and old on display. Philip grew red, chin down, eyes at his feet. We found a rare spot of unoccupied grass, where we lay our brittle bath towels. My mother on her belly, back to the sun. I bent down and undid the straps; I didn’t need to be asked. I found her handbag and took out the suntan lotion and squeezed the cream into my hands. Gross, Philip said, in his perpetual embarrassment, looking down at his Game Boy. The cream was cold against my hot hands; I massaged until the sunscreen disappeared into her back, hoping it might last longer, giving me something to do while I was here, letting me stay with my mother’s familiar body, rather than the dozens of others calling my attention nearby. Old men with their enormous, globular bellies. Girls in their teens smoking nearby, no adult intervening. I never wanted to leave. When our father had told us that we would be moving to Berlin, he had said four years, and that had seemed like an eternity. I had cradled the telephone for hours in my room, crying to Eva, planning ways I might stay with her family in Toronto. But four years now seemed too few. I would be 15 then, just as old as those girls over there. We had been inseparable, Eva and I, but I no longer missed her. It seemed that I had been carrying on with her because I hadn’t yet known about the world, all the other people in it. Then, Sabine. Not the first day at the pool but the second. At first, just a stranger on a towel a few meters away from mine, topless, me trying not to stare. Oblong nipples, dark and distended like stretched-out full moons. My mother, with one eye open, only half-listening to what Sabine was saying—she had started talking without a greeting, a stranger on a towel next to mine, our sudden intimacy, no introduction necessary. Philip, playing Tetris, pretending, successfully, not to care. Sabine was tan with an unevenly cut bob, no doubt something she’d fashioned on her own. She had hairy armpits; I tried not to look at those either. I’d never seen hair there on a woman before, but it had the same illicit urgency as the dark triangles in the pornos passed around at school. Sabine wanted to know where we were from; she had heard us speaking English. She had spent, she told me, a year in Wisconsin as a teenager on exchange and it was the most beautiful place in the world. Have you been? she asked, as if I were not an 11-year-old child. I told her I hadn’t, but that it seemed like one of those places that had more livestock than people in it, the kind of comment I’d heard my father make in the past. Laughter, hers, deep and from the belly, You’re funny. It’s good to have a sense of humor in your age, which made me blush. I wanted, from then on, above all else, to make Sabine smile, to make her laugh. Sabine spoke English well, save for her prepositions, which made the whole world, in her mouth, a little askew. My mother and Sabine spoke for a while and I could sense that my mother was glad to finally be speaking English again, to be having a conversation with someone other than me. Back home, my mother had always been entirely self-reliant, the kind of mother who didn’t easily make friends with the other mothers or the neighbors or her colleagues at work. But she and Sabine got along immediately. Or Sabine spoke and my mother listened. We spent the afternoon together. Sabine, we learned quickly, was a student at the university, and still, at age 29, working on her undergraduate degree in sociology. Looking back on it now, my mother must have envied Sabine this freedom, to study at the university for so many years without financial pressure. My mother had completed only the first two years of a degree in business administration before leaving Montreal for a summer job in the offices of an insurance company in Toronto. She’d met my father and stayed on, closed the door on her life before him. Sabine had an ease about her, so that when we got up from our towels to walk back to the U-Bahn, so did she, and instead of taking it in the direction of her apartment, she jumped onto our line, and spoke to us until we’d arrived at our stop, and then, as if it were the most natural thing, walked us all the way to the door of our apartment building. I could tell Philip found this infuriating, as he always did when other people tried to burst our sacred family bubble. My mother and I watched her with rapt attention, and for the first time since we had arrived in the strange city, we both felt taken care of. We made plans to see one another again the next day, or Sabine suggested it and my mother agreed. And just like that, Sabine was in our lives. Sabine, of the loose-fitting skirts and tops, breasts—untethered, outlined by a silk camisole—that I couldn’t help but track, shifting beneath her shirt as she moved, as she talked. Her smell like baby powder, and something botanical, the smell of all drugstores here, a scent that I would later come to think of simply as Germany. Trips to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum and the Fernsehturm and the Pergamon Museum were swiftly deemed boring by Sabine. Instead, a walking tour of all of the apartments she’d either lived in or thought of living in, and the ones her boyfriends and close friends had lived in too. This is where I lost my virginity, she informed us, pointing to a white-and-pink facade on a sunny street in Moabit. He was sleeping inside a bed, you know, that is close with the ceiling, so it was not a very good idea, she explained. A mezzanine, my mother providing the English word whenever Sabine couldn’t find it. How old were you? My mother asked. Thirteen, Sabine said tonelessly. My mother must have found this very young, but she said nothing. Instead, she smiled, Sabine looping her arm in hers and continuing the tour. And that is where we broke up, she said, pointing to the intersection of two broad boulevards nearby. Sabine had a way of making it seem like a life, for being one’s own, was worthy of commemoration. My mother never spoke about her own life this way, even though I knew hers had been an interesting one, full of rupture and self-definition. The fact of her, her past, always just beyond our reach, a living mystery. Why, I’d asked my father earlier that year, did we only rarely visit our grandparents in Montreal, or did our mother ignore calls from her sisters, who seemed, from the photographs at least, lively and sweet? My father had simply said, Your mother is a very complicated woman, as if we were two men sharing in our private language, in our incomprehension. We must have met Frank soon after that. Frank was, Sabine explained, her partner, a word I had only ever heard used in the context of business or crime. Frank—with his tight jeans and stringy, greasy dirty-blond hair, eyes blue and nearly cruel, a tiny gold hoop in his left ear—looked more like a criminal than a businessman. He smoked constantly, a brown stain where the filter hit the front tooth. He smelled too, of stale cigarettes and body odor, and something else, pine maybe, which was meant to mask it. On warm days, it only intensified the smell of his sweat. Frank, we pieced together from his digressive, elliptical storytelling, was from a town in the former East, a cow farm, where he’d grown up a strict Catholic. I grew up in the Scheisse, he liked to say, laughing, always looking at me when he made the joke, even though it was my mother’s response that he tracked afterward. And I wasn’t one of these guys who wanted to come to the West: America, Bruce Springsteen, that kind of thing. I miss it every day. And then Sabine would say something in German, just to him, something that sounded to me unspeakably technical, that I could not associate with love or romance. Yet Frank would respond, in English now, But of course, I would not know Sabine, and they would kiss—open and lingering and a little bit wet. Philip looking at his feet, my mother unfazed, as though the woman who’d spent our childhoods placing her hands over our eyes whenever an intimate scene came onto our small television screen had been suddenly replaced. Philip disliked Frank right away. I don’t know why we’re spending time with that trash, he said one morning, when my mother had made plans for us to spend the whole day with Sabine and Frank. I didn’t know you to be such a snob, my mother said, slapping him lightly across the face. She seemed as taken aback as we were by the gesture; she and Philip had been inseparable back home. In Toronto, it was in my brother’s presence that my mother had been happiest, most at ease. But there was no question of canceling our plans. The day trip to Treptower Park had been Frank’s idea; he was appalled, although not especially surprised, he let us know, by how conservative we’d been in our explorations of the city’s former East. That afternoon, Frank, as though aware of Philip’s objections to his personality, seemed set on taunting him with it. On the walk to the S-Bahn station from our apartment, he teased Philip about his near-empty backpack. Each time we passed a phone booth or a vending machine, he made a show of sticking two fingers into the coin dispenser to check for stray change. Frank finally found a deutsche mark coin in a cigarette machine and, unbeknownst to Philip, stuck it in the front pocket of his backpack, winking at me as he did. Frank must have been feeling lucky, because when my mother took our tickets out from her wallet so that Philip could validate them—one of Philip’s few remaining pleasures—Frank grabbed her gently by the arm, intercepting the exchange. We were tourists, Americans, he explained. Canadians, Philip mumbled. Certainly, Frank continued, we could get away with saying we didn’t understand German if a ticket inspector came onto the train. And if you get the fine, I pay it, Frank said. And if you don’t get inspected, you give me the tickets. Sabine rolled her eyes; Philip glared at Frank. Of course, there was nothing fair about the offer, but my mother looked at Frank and smiled, satisfied with the terms. It’s a deal, she said, a girlish glint in her eye. It was a long journey—11 stops—my stomach tight the entire time, picturing the moment we’d get caught, what would come afterward. We would have to tell my father, explain to him what we’d done: We had not paid the fare, on a dare. Why would you do such a thing? he would ask us, with the tone of moral incredulity he used whenever questions of civic responsibility, of personal integrity—however minor—were at stake. Inspections were frequent, but we got lucky that day. At the Treptower Park Station, my mother deposited the unused tickets into Frank’s expectant palm; he slipped them into the back pocket of his jeans and said, Schönen Dank! My mother did not look dejected. She appeared light, celebratory, even, as though she had gotten away with something too. From then on, Philip called Frank and Sabine “The Scheissters,” and to show my solidarity, I called them that too, even though I didn’t think it was fair that Sabine should be absorbed into the insult. Frank called me Frank, even though my name was Frances, Frankie to my family and to Eva. But Frank thought it was too much of a coincidence that our names should be so similar, and so he shortened my name and made it into his own. I didn’t mind having a new name in this new place and so I didn’t complain. I neither liked nor disliked Frank. I merely saw him for what he was: a man, not my father, who was suddenly always there. I had never seen a man’s body so close up, not even my father’s. Frank invited us to look at his in a way I understood women usually did, his T-shirts tight and worn so that we could make out his chest, lean and muscular, the veins pulsing down his arms as he moved, his limbs long and articulated. He had a strangely narcotic effect on my mother, so that when he spoke, she watched, impassive, until a languid smile emerged, which seemed to connect her to some internal circuit board. Frank was a journalist too, he explained, but not the kind your father is, he told me, putting his arm around my shoulders and squeezing. I write about politics and ideas in newspapers you or your father probably haven’t heard of. I wanted to tell him that my father had ideas too. He was the smartest man I knew. In these moments, I forced myself to remember my father—the sprinkling of freckles on his fair arms, his hair a funny russet mop that puffed up when it got too long—as though doing so would help my mother remember him fondly too. They liked me, Sabine and Frank, immediately, and treated me, it strikes me now, like my mother’s Mann. Do you two eat wurst? The two of them asked us one afternoon, as if my mother and I had the same taste in everything, excluding Philip from their questions, their attention, as they had learned to do. We both nodded, yes, which surprised me; I had never seen my mother eat pork before. Although she had disavowed nearly every part of her upbringing, she had always drawn the line at eating pork. And so, one afternoon at the Imbiss in the hot August light, my mother eating an entire bratwurst, drinking not one but two cans of beer. Frank offering his own freshly opened Schultheiss to Philip, whom he insisted on speaking to in German, Musst du es probieren—You have to try it. My brother looking up at my mother: a nod, or even just a lack of one. A sip, lips pursed, and then another slug, and then another. You like it? Frank asked. My brother shrugged but took another gulp and burped loudly. Everyone, including my mother, laughed. Frank was the one to say, Ja, enough, before grabbing the half-finished beer with his thick fingers and drinking the rest of it himself. Did I see it then? Philip’s particular pleasure? Some special unlocking of genetic proclivity? Or maybe Frank, like any good con artist, simply knew exactly what each of us wanted before we ourselves had figured it out. Sabine was our self-appointed teacher, our cultural liaison. Children in Berlin, we learned, took the U-Bahn alone to get to school, often before they could even read, and so they would count the stops on their fingers. It’s normal, she’d say of anything that seemed strange to us. What Sabine found abnormal was that we had never visited Wisconsin. How could we have missed the most beautiful place in the world? One afternoon at Wannsee, while my mother and brother were off swimming, Sabine asked me if I’d ever smoked a cigarette, and when I told her no, she looked at me as though that was not normal either and then said: You should try everything once; then you can take your decision. Otherwise, you’ll always be like everyone else, letting them decide for you. I hated, above all else, disappointing Sabine, and so I vowed, privately, to take her advice seriously. That evening, at the apartment, my brother and I sunburned and tired, my mother unpacking our beach bag immediately, as she always did. Philip sent to the kitchen to turn the oven on for our frozen pizza, our mother looking around frantically in her beach bag. I don’t believe it. I had them all afternoon, she said, looking at me, as though I would know exactly what she meant. I was certain I packed them up. Do you remember, Frankie? she asked me. My sunglasses, she clarified, impatiently. I tried to piece the day together in my mind. But I couldn’t picture the sunglasses or their leather case, just the faded spray roses of Sabine’s old bedsheet; Sabine cross-legged, quizzing us from my mother’s German-word book, the tanned, chubby look of her toes, painted a surprising pink; Sabine’s sunscreen, her open pack of paprika chips; Philip nearby, on his own towel, reading a comic book; Sabine stuffing the sheet into her Kaiser’s supermarket tote bag, smiling at me. Maybe Sabine put them in her bag when she was packing up? I offered. Maybe, my mother said, but I could tell this was not a version of the story that she liked, the answer she wanted. She furrowed her brow, moved away from me. Maybe someone took them on the U-Bahn, she said, not looking at me. We won’t tell your brother they’re missing, okay? But she didn’t have to worry about that. The next afternoon, at the Hackescher Hof with Sabine, white tablecloths and gold-stenciled columns, spaetzle for lunch, little worms wriggling around in a butter sauce. I waited for my mother to bring up the missing sunglasses. Instead, when the sun became too bright, she shielded her eyes with her hand. Want to switch seats? Sabine asked. Oh no, I’m fine, my mother answered. I forgot my sunglasses, she offered up, a lie uttered so effortlessly, I wondered how many others she’d told in her life. I never wear sunglasses, Sabine offered up. It’s too much of a, how do you call it, a curtain, with me and the world. When the check came, my mother was still in the bathroom, and I watched as Sabine moved it toward my mother’s side of the table, not even trying to hide the gesture from me. I nearly asked about the sunglasses, but then I remembered: I was only a child. When my mother returned, Sabine rose and went to the restroom as my mother placed the cash down for the meal, as she nearly always did with Frank and Sabine. I knew that they believed us to be rich, and my mother had done nothing to disabuse them of that impression; no doubt, she enjoyed the fantasy too. I had the thought, not for the first time since we’d moved, that if adults knew just what children really saw and understood, they would not act as though they were alone when children were around. Back at the apartment that afternoon, my mother took me aside and told me, I think I know what happened to the sunglasses. I remember feeling a little tug at my shoulder on the U-Bahn. But I remembered it differently: On our journey back to the apartment, she had been standing with Sabine, gripping the pole, and had placed the beach bag with its large opening on Philip’s lap. He’d attended to it with his usual vigilance; there was no way anything could have been stolen under his watchful eye. But when I tried to say as much, my mother changed the subject. Our sublet expired, and we moved into the Holiday Inn near the Gedächtniskirche. My father had been gone for five weeks by then, and his voice had started to sound, over the telephone, like a recording of itself. Soon, Frankie. They need me here. I love you. Take care of your mom. Philip had stopped speaking to him altogether. You’re going to hurt your father, my mother told him, but Philip just shrugged, not looking up from his Game Boy. Under regular circumstances, my mother would have complained about the hotel—the cheap floral bed covering, the bathroom with its bleach smell—but she took the unexpected move in her stride. On our first day there, she let us mope around in our pajamas all day watching NBC, the only English-speaking channel on the hotel TV, eating Haribo Smurfs and drinking Fanta straight from the bottle. She came in and out, running errands, smelling of cigarettes and her new perfume. We didn’t have many traveler’s checks left. My mother hid her trips to the exchange bureau from Philip and often asked me to stay behind with him while she went out to get more cash. When she returned, she put me in charge of placing the money pouch back into the bedside drawer when Philip wasn’t looking. I wondered what would happen when my father returned and found out that his cost-of-living allowance was being spent on dinners and drinks with Sabine and Frank, as well as other luxuries my mother had permitted herself in his absence. There was the bottle of perfume purchased at the Parfümerie Douglas while Philip and I waited outside; the pair of trousers to match the blouse at the small boutique; linen placemats and a delicate ceramic bowl she’d bought at a craft fair, first for herself, and then, when Sabine had suggested that she too liked the pairing, for her as well. My mother, I knew, had always kept a separate bank account, her own, where she saved half of her monthly paycheck from the insurance company, but this was not the money she was spending in Berlin. She had told me once, in a rare moment of maternal advice: Remember, Frankie, a woman always needs her own money. You never know what might happen between two people. It was true, I didn’t know, and yet I suspected it; with my mother, talk of relationships had always thrummed with a certain threat. As a treat for Philip’s birthday, we bought a large jar of Skippy peanut butter, Kraft Dinner, and individual-size boxes of Corn Pops and Frosted Flakes, all priced as luxury goods in the KaDeWe food department. I was put in charge, before we went on this shopping spree, while Philip brushed his teeth and my mother smoked a cigarette outside, of removing the calculator from Philip’s bag. I found them then: my mother’s sunglasses, wedged in the inside pocket of Philip’s weightless backpack, not missing at all. I moved swiftly, still focused on my original mission. I placed the calculator in the bedside table, next to the laminated room-service menu and the money belt, and zipped closed the knapsack, laying it on its side, as it had been before I’d picked it up. I left the sunglasses exactly where I’d found them; I could be decisive, hide the truth as well as any adult. Later, watching Philip in the imported-foods aisle, I was glad I had not told my mother. Philip seemed so at ease among the garish packaging, the familiar brands—his birthday homecoming—ignoring the prices, not even reaching for the calculator in his backpack. Although he was officially a year older, 13 now, his age seemed incidental. He was so much younger than me, in need of my protection, my secrecy. A few days later, feeling around for the sunglasses while Philip was still asleep—my mother gone to the bakery—I was surprised to find that the pocket where the sunglasses had been was now empty. I looked around in his suitcase, under his bed, in the pocket of his fleece, his windbreaker, but I couldn’t find them anywhere. One evening, Frank and Sabine visiting our hotel room, their singularity at odds with the drab interior. Sabine sitting cross-legged, at home wherever there was a floor. Frank messing with the remote control. My mother wearing a pretty dress, mixing drinks on the varnished hotel-issued desk, as though she were hosting a cocktail party. A strange scene: this North-American family, father missing, with a 20-something German couple in the Holiday Inn Berlin Kudamm, 99 Deutschmarks a night, with a discount for a week, which my mother had negotiated by speaking to not two but three different employees. I had been relieved to watch her do it, to find that perhaps she had not, in fact, entirely forgotten about our father, about us. I wondered where our father would have settled if he’d been there that evening, but I couldn’t picture his body in the scene. The only person in the room tethering us back to him was Philip; I could tell Philip thought we were fickle, that our loyalties were cheap. Ice, my mother indicated to Philip and me, passing me the plastic bucket. Philip took a while to snap to attention, but then my mother raised an eyebrow and we slinked out of bed into the hallway. We raced to the elevator in our flip-flops, tripping a little as we did. We fought to press the button. I won, as I always did, and then we fought, too, to press down on the lever of the ice machine. But I let Philip do the honors, knowing he needed the win more than I did, the sense of temporary power: the ice clattering, the loud whoosh, the release. On the way back to the room, we didn’t race but walked slowly instead. Philip looked so sad, I wanted to shove him, or to slap him, as my mother had just a few weeks before, so he could come back to us, be my older brother again. I knew that he hated Frank and Sabine, hated their presence in our room, hated the way they acted upon our mother, and upon me. He missed our father and the normalcy his presence would have necessarily restored. He missed our beat-up minivan. He missed baseball practice. He missed our neighbor’s dog, a dachshund who always slunk right up to him, licking his open palm. I knew all of this without him saying a word. Why didn’t I miss these things too? I put my hand on his shoulder, just as Frank was in the habit of doing with me. Philip let me keep it there longer than expected before pushing it away. Don’t be a weirdo, he said. I could see, from the side, that his cheeks were gleaming pink; he was crying. We had forgotten the key and so when we got back to the locked door, we knocked and waited, wondering, after some time, if we’d gotten the room number wrong. My mother finally arrived, slightly flushed, her hair down. She smiled at us; Willkommen, she said, as though we were late arrivals to her party. She was a little bit drunk, her eyes darker than usual. She looked young, like the photographs I’d seen of her from the period when she and my father had first met; she’d been only 19 then. Frank lying on his back, using a paper clip to clean his fingernails. Sabine, armed with my mother’s comb, returning to the activity we’d interrupted: braiding my mother’s dark mass of wavy hair. My mother was very proud and protective of her hair, and I had never once seen another person, not even my father, touch it. In Toronto, she had cut her own bangs and trimmed her own split ends. Sabine wet her comb in the glass and glided it through my mother’s long hair. My mother sighed with pleasure, and I had the urge to turn the volume up on the television. When Sabine was halfway done, she brought my mother to the mirror, and I heard Sabine say, You have such nice eyebrows. My mother demurred, said something about missing the woman who waxed them back home. That’s normal? Sabine asked. For my 11th birthday, earlier that year, my mother had taken me to that very aesthetician; she had waxed my legs and the three lone hairs under my armpits, the small shadow above my lip, the hair between my eyebrows. My mother had made the appointment for me; driven me to the small salon, in a strip mall in a part of town I’d never been to; sat on a chair beside me as I squirmed in my underwear beneath the stranger’s tender efficiency. When I had started to cry, my mother had grabbed for my hand, but I’d refused it, finding her touch unbearable. I had the thought for the first time: I am separate; I belong to myself. And aside from thinking that my mother was the most beautiful, the most interesting woman in the world, I hated her a little bit too. I had immediately swallowed these thoughts down. I was a good-natured, loyal child, and it had frightened me, what these thoughts might do, what they might set in motion between us. My mother had said, in the car on the way home, as a kind of apology perhaps, You’ll thank me later, because you’ll never have to shave. She had always been, before this moment, so careful with me. Whatever her mother had been to her—overbearing, intense—she had handled me with an opposite energy. It was as though she were worried that any explicit assertion of her power—to love or to punish—might affirm some similarity between them. Philip seemed not to take in the scene in the hotel room. He crawled into the nearest bed, tucked himself in with his jeans still on, returned to Super Mario Brothers. Frank propped himself up on his elbows and snapped his fingers at Philip, and said, Hey, man, I think there’s a beer in there, pointing to the mini-fridge. Philip perked up at the mention of the beer, even putting his Game Boy down. Yeah? he said, with his practiced shrug. Ja, Frank said, and set about getting him one. He crawled around my mother and Sabine; I waited for my mother to say something, anything. Surely, she should be the one to say no. But it was Sabine who grabbed Frank by the belt loop as he made his way past her, and I watched as some electric current moved between them, and then a few words spoken in German very quickly—too quickly for me to even hear the words individually—Frank crawling backwards, as if on rewind, head down, looking up at Philip and saying, Sorry, man. When Sabine speaks, you listen; that is the rule. Philip did not say anything or even look at Frank, just back at the tiny screen of his gray console, but I could see the redness that had erupted across his throat. The invitation to have something he might want, and then its retraction, was the exact kind of inconsistency that drove Philip crazy. I spent the rest of the evening lying in bed with Philip, pretending to watch the German-culture program that was playing on TV. The men were debating something important about the future of the country, but I couldn’t understand what positions each was taking. Just two old men frowning, gesticulating; Frank snorting, swearing on the second bed. My mother sat silently on the floor, back to me and to Sabine, who continued to twist her hair into a braid that looped around the front of her head like a crown. My queen, I had heard my father call my mother on a few occasions, and the idea had embarrassed me, his deference to her, this power she had accrued how, exactly? She sat that evening nearly silently, an emanation, head rocking gently back and forth with the current of Sabine’s hand weaving. It seemed more and more dangerous—her power, her sovereignty—a glass teetering on a table’s edge. Done with her coiffure, Sabine rose and tapped my hip to indicate that I should move over and settled onto the bed between Philip and me. Philip groaned, but Sabine laid her arms around both of our shoulders and declared: It’s like camp, isn’t it? And we’re like s’mores. I’m the marshmallow. She laughed. I had them once in Wisconsin. So disgusting, right? But, you know, good too, she said to Philip. But he ignored her, so she looked at me, and I said, Yeah, not knowing what else to say. My mother was in the bathroom, and for a moment, I had the thought that if she left us, as I knew some parents did, maybe Sabine could step in and be my mother instead. Yet if my mother left, wouldn’t it be to be with Frank? In which case, Sabine probably wouldn’t want to stick around us, to be reminded of her heartbreak. Or maybe my mom would want to live with both of them like on Melrose Place, where young and attractive people lived near one another, a revolving door of attachments and betrayals—only in this case it would be in Berlin, and there wouldn’t be a pool but an interior courtyard with decrepit bikes and an elaborate system of trash and recycling. The image of my mother, living another life without us in it, was not a new one. How long had I held it? Not a fear exactly, but a queasy interior tug, a thought to avoid just in case thinking it might make it come true. I had always been comforted by a certain attendant superstitious belief: My mother loved Philip far too much to leave our family. He was too precious to her, too dear. But that had been before; now I wasn’t so sure. When my mother finally came out from the bathroom, she looked taken aback by the arrangement of our bodies. She gestured to the spot on the bed next to Frank, and said to Sabine in a gentle but firm tone, You’ll be more comfortable there, no? Sabine squeezed my shoulder, rose and jumped into the bed next to ours, curling up to Frank like an overgrown cat. He lay his hand instinctively on her soft waist; she made a sound like purring. I missed Sabine, her warmth, her heavy breathing, her thick presence next to mine, so foreign and pleasurable. Instead, Philip’s clammy feet, my mother’s rigid body, kept at a distance from mine. I wanted to grab my mother’s hand, to tell her not to leave us; we were a family. Philip needed her; he wasn’t doing well at all. But I couldn’t get my hand to move over to hers. My arms stayed stuck to my sides, unwilling to cooperate. Frank asked if they could order room service, and my mother said, Of course, leaning over and opening the side-table drawer, just long enough, I noticed, for Sabine to see, above the laminated menu, the thick money belt—beige and somehow as illicit as a pair of underwear or some exposed part of the body. My mother and I had gone together to cash 1,000 deutsche marks only that afternoon. My mother lay back down, turned over to face us; she put her arm around my waist and tried to reach for Philip too, but he shimmied his body away from ours in revolt. My mother settled on hugging just me. A relief. I could breathe again. Get some sleep, Frankie, she spoke sweetly into my hair, kissed my cheek. You look nice, I said, touching the thick silken plait poised above her forehead. I must have fallen asleep, because when I opened my eyes, it was morning, and my mother was already dressed, Philip snoring next to me, still wearing his jeans, his face ruddy, his upper lip slick with night sweat; the bed next to ours already made. I bought us some breakfast, my mother said, passing me a brötchen mit Käse right in bed. She looked fresh and concerned, Sabine’s braid still crowning her head but loosened and uneven, a little sad-looking in the light of day. I didn’t have to wait, as I usually did, to piece together what was wrong with her. She whispered to me, It’s gone, pointing to the bedside drawer. They took it, she said. I can’t believe it. I watched my mother pace the room; I ate my brötchen quietly, letting the seeds fall between the sheets, not even catching them in my cupped hand, as I usually did. Then she sat on the ground at my feet, and I knew what she wanted me to do. I started unplaiting. I worked gently but efficiently, trying not to hurt her tender scalp. As I undid the braid, my mother’s thick hair fell into my hands and I felt it in her, the switch, the split: before and after. I might have said something then, about Philip, the sunglasses, the backpack. But I didn’t. It was her skill, but I could have it too; I already did. To decide: That’s it. To close the door on those people, that phase. To turn the page. I let her do it; I did not intervene. She got up and kissed me on the forehead. You’re a good girl, she said, but I didn’t exactly feel like one. When the phone rang while she was out—Sabine, no doubt—I didn’t pick up, just as my mother had instructed me. And when Philip asked me what was wrong—had Mom broken up with the Scheissters?—I told him I knew what he’d done. The sunglasses. The money. He didn’t deny it. Give it to me, I said. No, he replied, and so I went into his backpack myself. I was not angry; I was satisfied. What I thought I knew was true. I counted it out loud: 780 Deutschmarks. I didn’t even ask him why. I understood. I thought for a moment, considered the different outcomes. We’ll give it back to her 20 Deutschemarks at a time, I said, as though I really was a Frank after all. I wished Sabine could see me this way, one last time: suave and certain. Making my own decisions. Taking things into my own hands. How easy it was, just a single phone call. Our father back within two days. I pictured what my mother must have said: We need you. Come home. The kids. He had a concerned, harried look when we first saw him, an uncanny guest in the lobby of our Holiday Inn. He smelled oddly unlike himself, like the airplane and the soap from foreign hotels. The conversation between my parents, when it finally took place, happened in the bathroom of the hotel room. Philip turned the volume up on Jay Leno, but I pressed my ear to the door. She had been robbed, I heard her explain. Robbed? Where? Why hadn’t she told him over the phone? His voice like a branch snapped off in a gust of wind. You’re being very confusing; tell me exactly what happened, Sophie, he said, and I pictured him in there with one of his black-and-white reporter’s notebooks with the coil at the top, just a few words per page in his indecipherable scrawl. And then she told him everything, from the beginning. From the time at the swimming pool, to the Imbiss, to the many walks around Sabine’s neighborhood, to the trip to Treptower Park and the Hackescher Hof. She spoke the facts, the kind my father would be interested in. The exact number of times we had met up with them, the name of the village where Frank had said he was from, the name of the publication he wrote for, the exact amount of money stolen, 780 Deutschmarks. It won’t take me long to find them, he said. It might even make a good story. My mother let out a little inchoate cry. No, Joel. I didn’t hear the rest. The taps were turned on. But I imagine the particular quieting down, the thing that I had never understood—would never understand—between them, a pitch unreachable to anyone else, their quiet acquiescence; in other words, their love, or maybe simply their marriage. We moved the next day to a cheaper hotel in the Western suburbs and found an apartment more affordable than any of the others we’d looked at. It had a brutalist charmlessness, but a room for each of us, and was walking distance from our school. School was not as different from Toronto as we expected. Every effort was made to shorten the distance between this place and North America, the school’s ethos like sliced bread: comforting but not especially nutritious. Philip made friends quickly there, and I found two boys—the son of a Nigerian diplomat and the son of a Bostonian violinist at the Berlin Philharmonic—who didn’t mind spending time with me. My mother stayed mostly in the apartment, doing penance, although for what, exactly, I wasn’t sure. Philip and I returned the money one 20-deutsche-mark bill at a time, and there was a certain pleasure in watching my mother’s little flash of joy at finding more than she’d thought was hers. When we did venture into Berlin for the odd concert or for an exhibit or to visit some expat my father had been put in touch with, she always wore her prettiest clothes, the silk blouse and trousers from the boutique in Charlottenburg. In them, she had that expectant sense about her, as though at any point she might be recognized. Our stay in Berlin lasted only one year. My father was called back to Toronto before his posting was over. Budget cuts, the newspaper gave as an explanation. He would make editor within the year. I was not wrong about my mother. She was, I must have sensed it even then, with my child’s prescience, destined for rupture, scorched-earth cycles. Within two years of our return, my parents would be divorced, my mother gone to live in Vancouver with her second husband, an insurance salesman with a face as smooth and supple as a child’s. My brother and I saw her, after that, only during holidays, which merely solidified what she’d always felt like to me: a scarce resource, on loan from another life. I hated her for six months, maybe a year, as any teenager would, but it was a feeling that was impossible, constitutionally speaking, for me to sustain for very long. My father reacted to his heartbreak with a similar composure: He was sad and forlorn until he couldn’t stand to be that way anymore. It was Philip who took the divorce most to heart. He pointed the finger at my father: He had been the one to upend our lives, had been the real absence all along. He pointed the finger at me: I had no character, followed others around like a dog. Philip punished us by disappearing for days at a time, showing up drunk at our high school, getting into fistfights at the smallest slight. It would take him nearly a decade to recover from the bomb my mother’s departure detonated in his fragile life. But that was all much later. That year in Berlin, at least as I remember it now, had the pleasant, suspended quality in our family’s history of an entre-guerre, a détente."

        "story": "Do I have rivals? Competitors? Certainly: the sports blatherers with their outer-borough accents, the medicine men and their elixirs, the partisan boosters who stir up primitive rage, the DJs peddling their caterwaulings. From one end of the dial to the other, clamor and cacophony. My mode is otherwise: seduction, consolation, the whisper, the voice that caresses and heals. The voice of a lover. And sometimes of a skeptic. The middle of the night is mine. From 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. I am sovereign here in my windowless cubicle. My desk with its scattered papers and corn-muffin crumbs, my electric coffee pot, my chair, my mic, the ancillary mic that connects me to the tech interior (and to Peter, the screener who weeds out the nuts and the cranks), the extra chair that is never used, the door that leads to my personal W.C., the time signal on the clock on the wall. And out there in the invisible dark, the sleepless, the solitary old with their decrepit hearing aids, the unknown tormented who lie awake in their hundreds of thousands—those unpredictable callers to call-in shows, the braggarts, the know-it-alls, the timid stutterers, the unassuaged sufferers of unforgiven family quarrels, the enraged, the bitter, the lonely, the hopeless, the jilted, the sacked. The masses of racked human roil. I sleep during that daylight I rarely see, except as it seeps in the advancing hours under the threshold of the door to my cubicle, which during broadcasts is always shut. The tech interior incessantly keeps track of audience ratings, but they mean nothing to me; I am, after all, on the leaner side of 74, and have had my steady following for years. I cut off the feed when the commercials take over and during those so-called musical intervals (drums tearing into the brain). Almost always I can predict what is to come—someone’s nocturnal cry in a parched tract of wilderness peopled only by the unlucky. And by me, their intimate, their confidante. Their trustworthy tryst. And sometimes their disloyal doubter. Nicky at Night is how I am featured. And here, in this no-man’s-land of secrecy, is where I am confounding. My radio voice is, in fact, my primary toolbox, and can travel as it pleases into both high and low registers. Am I Nicholas or Nicole? Whichever suits the need. Whatever your hunger, I am the sustenance. Name your belief, and I am your god. But I can be impatient too. I can reprimand, I can correct the self-pitying. Some say I am a charlatan, a deceiver, a shaman; but never mind, this only increases my popularity; in the land of video, I would count as a showpiece. And show is the key. Nothing on radio can be shown. All the world is drawn to screens, to faces, to seeing. Radio is obsolete. It ought not to exist. An illusion. If you call me, you hallucinate. I am not meant to be seen. Yet here was a figure sitting in my unused chair. “How did you get in here?” I said. “Saw your name on the door, took a chance it wasn’t locked—” “I’m on in five minutes, so get out, go.” “But I’ve been waiting for you, and you know me, you’ve known me forever. I’m not just any random nobody.” I did not say Of course you are. You all are, every one of you. Aloud I said, “I’ll call security if you don’t get out right now.” “You don’t understand. You saved my life.” One of those, I thought. The ones in pursuit of a savior. The ones mostly winnowed out by Peter. These invasions occasionally happen. The seekers (so I’ve privately named them) usually ask for money. Once I’ve mentioned security and hand them some cash, they disappear. This one did not. “I just want to sit here awhile and watch how you do it, see if you mean what you say.” “Please leave. I need my privacy when I’m at work.” “I won’t be in the way, and I’ll even set up the coffee. Well look, you’ve got only one cup, but it’s all right, I should stay away from caffeine anyhow.” The on-air light on the wall went on. Two minutes. Into the ancillary mic I shouted, “Music!” Horns, clarinets, and a raucous nasal chorus swelled, crowding the air, followed by security with their badges. Before she fled, the intruder—the seeker—threw out, “Impostor! Fake!” This incident, brief and harmless though it was, left its mark. I felt scathed and unsettled: It is true that I am an impostor, and what performer isn’t? Still, the word stirred an unexpected longing. The impostor is a puppeteer whose marionette is the self, an unfulfilled living actor turned wooden. At heart, buried and undisclosed, didn’t I hope to be a seeker myself? To break out of the prison of pretense into the freedom of … what? Feeling. Pure feeling. And once I did. The caller’s story—they all have stories—was preposterous. He claimed he was 19 and already a widower. He pronounced this in separate syllables: wi-do-wer, as if he had still to get used to it. His wife had died tragically and unexpectedly, from fast-acting leukemia. This expression alone, fast-acting leukemia, appeared to be lifted from an all-night cancer barker. He said he had fathered an infant, and that his former wife’s mother was caring for it, and that he was barred from ever seeing his own flesh and blood, not that he cared. This was all so absurdly melodramatic, and all of it in some newly ripened boyish timbre, that I half-believed he was a brazen brat up well past his bedtime on purpose to lampoon. He said he saw right through me, and was ready to offer some advice. “You could use a partner,” he said. “You’re getting tedious, all on your own.” Voices are what I know, and he was not 19. I said, “How old are you really?” “So why don’t you see for yourself? If you invite me, I’ll come.” “Sorry, I don’t have visitors.” “I’d come as a collaborator.” Here was a smart aleck whom Peter ought to have sent packing. And when Peter fails me, I have my cutoff switch. I use it sparingly, though, so as not to seem brutish. I maintain my auditory smile. But I used it now. Less than a week later I discovered him—the purported widower—at ease in my extra chair. I had arrived early, but he might have been there for half the day. I knew him by his boy’s voice, yet now it carried a different syrup: He had cajoled security into trusting that the talk-show host had summoned him. He was surely much younger than 19. And because I had scolded him with my gruffest inflections, he had supposed the host to be Nicholas, but here was Nicole instead. I caught the spasm of surprise in his eyes. They were very black eyes; the pupil and the iris made a single oval of lightless dark. His head was all Mediterranean, Italian or Greek or Levantine: the curly black hair, winding wild over the ears, the earth-carved nose and mouth. The nose, the source of life’s breath … but that mouth! What I saw—what came over me, in the way of instinct, of unwilled sensation—was that the boy was beautiful. His hands were beautiful. The throat with its Adam’s apple (the name itself a hint of Eden), the bare uninnocent nape. This was distracting; it was unnatural, as much as if he had been acutely disfigured. I was forced to stare. I was unable not to look and look. I said, “Go home and go to bed. Don’t you have school in the morning?” “I’ve listened to you every night for months. Every night when you’re on. I’ve got one of these transistor radios, fits into a pocket. I can keep you like a secret.” “And when I’m not on?” “Mostly I spend the night in the library. The big one with the lions. I go in just before closing, and afterward they can never find me. The best place is periodicals. That’s how I get to keep up.” A drawer in my table was partly open. He had sniffed out the box of corn muffins. A random circle of yellow crumbs was spread around his feet. But he had no shoes. Instead, here was a row of flawless little toes in plastic sandals, and then the pathos of a boy’s lone big toe. Was he a runaway, a truant? A busy thief? A chronic master of stealth? Was there a parental search under way? Or was he a mote among the abandoned homeless, with no one to miss him? Was it his intuition to conceal himself in fantasy (the forbidden infant, warm nights among the stacks)? Had he come to me as a protector, to hide out? “You should put me on the air,” he said. The air: a raft that rode on the wind. But something was breaking out, a disruption, an unruly directive—a decree—I had never before heeded, or taken to heart. His beauty was terrifying. It looted, it deprived me of my own secrets. I looked and I looked, I saw and I saw, but fitfully. Furtively. I didn’t dare hold my gaze; he was a child, not an exhibit. He could not have been more than 14. A septuagenarian staring at a vagabond boy. A stupidity and a perplexity. And I all at once took in that I would, in fact, do it—put the boy on the air. There was no logic to it, no reason, a kidnapping, an exploitation of a minor, and thousands would know. The station manager would know. The station owner would know. I might be sacked for underhandedness. For an unannounced turning, for running wild. “Come here,” I told the boy. “Sit next to me. Bring over that other chair. We’ll share the mic.” His closeness dizzied me. It was as if I had inhaled a drug. Or was the boy redolent of some faint narcotic that, so suffocatingly near was he, was leaching through my skin? And so it began. The signature opening, that choir of tumult I so much despised; but I had neglected to ask him his name. There was no need to put questions, or to explain. His voice alone carried the hours. The widower was nowhere. The boy was an instrument of fabrication. He led from disbelief to disbelief. New implausibles swarmed. The somnolent woke; the boy’s voice roused them to the long-ago children they once were, or fathered, or mothered, or lost, or mourned, or were estranged from. He animated them, they were drawn to him like the millings of shadowy moths, they seemed to see what he made them see, he was visible in his voice. The boy’s voice, the look of the boy, an unfolding, an unnerving, an undoing that made me afraid of the very thing it was: a visitation of feeling, pure feeling. Daylight crept under the doorsill. “Thank you,” the boy said then. “I hope you think I did well.” He swiped the last of the corn muffins and left. There were no repercussions. Whether the ratings thickened or shrank I was never told. The audience returned to its usual configuration: grief and grievance, lamentation and despair. Those end-of-life larynxes scratching out their woes were sickening me; at 75, I retired. My slot was instantly replaced by a chiropractor hawking his surefire panacea, and I was just as instantly forgotten, never mind that he and I were equal saviors. What is more evanescent than a voice on the radio? In my newly freed leisure I went often to the movies, though I disliked being made to see what in novels I could otherwise see for myself, how a room was replicated, the carpet, the vase on the windowsill, the large sofa, the small sofa, five figurines on a shelf. All of them falsifying shadows, specters declaiming reality. I had the notion that beauty, supernal beauty, would not go to waste, and could be captured and somehow disseminated, as it had been one night on the radio. Maturity must somehow abrade or deform it; for this I was prepared. But the boy could not have become what he already was: an actor. An impostor. Still, it is indisputable that a boy grows into a man. I explored the reading tables in the periodicals room of the library. The boy had hidden in the midnight stacks; the man was missing from the tables. I listened to the radio at night. I still do—what elderly insomniac does not? I tune in to the pundits, the show-offs, the hucksters, the healers, the howlers, the ringmasters, the weather forecasters, the traffic reporters, the inescapable musical intervals that screech. I search through the dial, from highest to lowest, until tedium and fatigue overcome naked hope. And all who are sleepless must ask—what is more fleeting than feeling, pure feeling?"

        "story": "I didn’t know by what accident the builders had managed it, but instead of a remodeled bathroom attached to my bedroom, they had installed Silivri Prison. No mistaking it. After the laborers had packed up their tools and cleaned up their mess (they had almost superstitiously prevented me from checking on their progress), I threw open the door and stepped to where my shower should be, but instead found a cell with a guard walking by. I asked him where I was in Italian. Confused, he asked me in Turkish what I wanted. “Where am I?” I responded in Turkish. “Are you sick? Silivri Prison.” “That’s not right. This is supposed to be a grand shower with two heads and massaging jets and a marble bench.” “Massaging jets, haha! No, this is the prison.” “But what’s it doing in my bathroom?” I asked. “It isn’t,” he said. I pointed behind me at the doorway I had just walked through to my bedroom beyond it. He looked into the cell and saw that indeed it led to my bedroom. “Now how did they mess up like that?” “The builders just finished today. The plumber turned on the water a moment ago,” I said. “Well, how do you know your bathroom isn’t in Silivri Prison instead of the other way round?” Frustrated with the oaf, I latched on to the cell bars and throttled myself against them, but they wouldn’t budge. “Keep this to yourself,” he said, as if talking about an elephant behind window drapes. “I don’t need the headache of explaining this to the warden. I have enough problems as it is without you stirring up trouble.” As soon as he said “trouble,” I ran back to my bedroom, slammed the door shut, and used the plastic tarp to hide the renovation from my husband, who would be home any minute. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a very understanding man, sometimes too understanding, and though he would understand this—whatever this means—he has a very nervous disposition, and this is precisely the sort of thing to trigger his anxiety so that his stomach is nothing but ulcers and acids in flux, and on his tongue would be the refrain: “Dear me! Dear me! O, deary, deary me!” I called the builder, but the phone rang without end. Then I called one of the plumbers, and one of the carpenters, and the tile guy, and anyone else whose number I had, but they all went to voicemail. This couldn’t be happening at a worse time. We had decided to remodel the bathroom (even though we didn’t have the money for it) because my father could no longer live on his own. In fact, he hadn’t been able to live on his own for some time now. When we’d moved to Italy, he’d insisted he wasn’t some invalid who needed to be doted on or else sealed up in a dank little hospice room, so he’d bought his own flat across the street from us, but he was, even then, already dependent on us. We kept saying to each other that he might get better as a way of convincing ourselves of its truth, but his condition was already very poor. The doctors didn’t say that. It’s not so bad right now—that’s what the doctors said, knowing it would get worse—but they didn’t ask my father or me, and that’s not what either of us would have said: It’s not so bad right now.  The first time we took him to the hospital was years ago, when we still lived in Istanbul, at the peak of the Gezi Park protests. The police had come in with their tanks and water cannons. Everywhere little clouds of tear gas sprang up, in bouquets of pain. We watched it all on the news. My husband was at his wits’ end (he had grown up in a certain era, in a certain household, where the state was the most fearful thing). I was impressed, I suppose, that so many people had gotten together without hurting one another. I was impressed that they had lasted so long in their barricades and camps, but I could not find any desire to join them. I tried to stir up a bit of something like courage to go to the park and join the protests—I knew it was what my father wanted to do, though he was too old—but I couldn’t find this ounce of grace in me. For his part, my father obsessed over following each development, with learning the demands of the fractious groups—the anarchists, the communists, the environmentalists, the Kemalists, the Turanists. Despite knowing the myriad factions, however, he started confusing simple things, like the names of political parties. Then he’d forget the day’s events entirely while watching the evening news. When an attempt by police to end the unrest came to a head, he started rambling about the 1980s, the upheavals and battles he’d listened to on the radio, the arrests and dismissals, the summary execution of 50 extremists. But these were the wrong events, the wrong names—ghosts of a coup that had happened more than 30 years ago. I asked him if he wanted to go and watch the demonstrations to help get his bearings. I didn’t know then that he was sick. I can’t imagine what I would have done if he’d said yes. Some gnawing desire for trouble cropped up in me. I asked if he knew who the prime minister was. I asked if he knew the date. I asked if he knew whose house we were in. Instead of answering, my father kept shaking his head and saying no, no, no, no. I asked if he knew his own name. He shot out of his chair and told me to shut up—something he’d never said, even when I was a little girl too jealous of my parents’ time. He stomped to the television and tried to change the channel, but he’d grabbed the wrong remote and so only increased the volume. I kept repeating over and over: “Dad, you are not okay.” He pushed the television over. It thudded awkwardly without shattering. Then, sitting on the coffee table in the fresh silence, he admitted that he didn’t know where he was. I calmed him down (my husband spent the whole of the protests huddled in the bathtub in case of bombings) and took him to his doctor, who then suggested a specialist who did some scans, told us they couldn’t identify the problem, and mentioned that if it had been an isolated incident, it would likely clear up on its own. “These are stressful times,” they said. “I’ve knew a patient who suddenly lose a finger from anxiety.” But they didn’t explain. Pacing outside my renovated bathroom, I dialed my contractor once more. At last he answered. I demanded to hear a justification of this egregious mistake, but a loud buzz came through the wall I shared with the adjoining flat. My neighbor had started their coffee grinder and put the kettle on, which would soon whistle loudly. I asked the contractor to repeat himself but the grinder kept on buzzing. I could hardly hear the contractor’s explanation as I paced around, so I ducked back into the prison cell, where all was quiet. He told me that he always verified everything with the customer, that he required receipts with signatures to that effect, at which point he emailed me scans of my signature, indicating I had approved the installed materials and fixtures. “Yes, materials and fixtures perhaps, but they put them to use all wrong! They’ve made some horrible amalgamation of them. I wanted a bidet, not a prison washbasin. It is a jail cell!” “That is a rude exaggeration, though I can barely understand it with your accent.” “No,” I insisted. “There is a prison and a guard where there should be a bathroom!” “That seems highly unlikely to have happened in any case,” said the contractor, and he rang off. Then, as if the notion of coffee (spurred by my neighbor’s grinder) had plopped out of my head and begun wandering the house on its own, a small cup of Turkish coffee appeared in the corner of the cell. I thought perhaps the guard had brought it for me while I was talking to the contractor. He must have heard the distress in my voice, even in Italian. No doubt I looked frantic and despairing. But I hadn’t seen him come by, nor had I heard the soft scrape of porcelain being set down on concrete. The coffee was there and the guard was not. I took a sip and felt awash in giddiness. It was the precise duplicate of the coffee served at Mandabatmaz, in Beyoğlu, with its thick foam the consistency of a luxurious dream, and I felt that all the time and distance that separated me from Istanbul was gone for the briefest of moments. I took the coffee inside to my father. I made him hold it, and I mimed drinking to get him to do so. “Isn’t it just like at Mandabatmaz?” I asked. He took a sip and made a face. “It isn’t correct,” he said. It was a phrase he was using lately to allude to thoughts he could no longer articulate. “Isn’t it just how they used to make it?” His disappointment was obvious. He looked ready to speak, but instead kept making the same small facial gestures. I interrupted his stupor and asked again if it tasted just like how he remembered. He only managed to raise his eyebrows and pout his lips and say nothing. I took the cup from him to finish, but inexplicably it was empty: not just the coffee but the grounds too. My front door rattled in its jamb. I ran to replace the tarp before my husband entered, then I flew down the hall and planted a kiss on his cheek. He gave my chin a pet, and I took his briefcase from him (he liked having a briefcase though he had absolutely no use for the thing). I told him that the plumber had made a mistake and that we would have to keep using the guest bathroom. He sighed and asked me about my day as we settled into our happy if trite routine, but the only thing on my mind was the prison. I realized that if a guard hollered at someone or an alarm started blaring, there was no way I could convince my husband it was merely the sound of a defective toilet. Fortunately, however, the wing of the prison that had been installed was a quiet one, or by some other miracle the sounds did not carry through the door and tarp. We ate our dinner and took care of my father’s needs. We brushed our teeth and went to bed very early. All my life I have been accused of an unwarranted optimism. In the morning, after my husband set out for work, I went down to the cellar of our building. Keeping only the most utilitarian objects in the flat, we had stuffed the rest of our personal belongings into boxes when my father moved in, abandoning them until we could repopulate our lives once more with our delighting possessions (where had I put that book? have you seen the flower vase? why is the potato peeler missing?). I lugged everything into the prison cell, which, for being a cramped prison cell, held all our effects quite well, and was certainly secure—more secure than a cellar in the Italian countryside. Yes, I suppose if I couldn’t have a new en suite bathroom, I’d at least now get free shelter. I pulled a few knickknacks out of a box and sorted them. In this box were happy books, in this box were glittering frames, in this box were my hiking boots and mittens and extra scarves that I’d worn when my husband and I went up to the mountains around Rize, and there at the bottom was a scrap of soil, a little plant that had managed to grow despite it quarters, stringent and fresh—a little tea bush, somehow. The second time we took my father to the hospital, a few years had passed. The government had survived a corruption scandal. High-profile politicians had been implicated in a gold-smuggling ring. Then a witch hunt saw hundreds of police investigators, lawyers, judges, and journalists arrested. Not long after, a wave of bombings swept through Turkey—it seemed like one happened every month. Really, if you paid attention, you might have thought the country was being gobbled up by disaster, but catastrophe is a household staple in Turkey. Smack in the middle of all this, my father had been attacked by a political fanatic who had mistaken him for a grave threat to the nation. In fact, my father was mostly an academic who had made a name for himself beyond lecture halls as a novelist of inspired if inconsistent ability—his greatest talent was antagonizing the government. As my father was on his way home from one of his lectures, the fanatic tried to shoot him. The gun wouldn’t fire, so the man tackled my father and broke his nose and arm before the two were pulled apart by a number of faculty members. Once again, we were recommended to a specialist, and booked scans and tests, and were taken to a little room where a different doctor told us that my father’s brain was shrinking. It was like a peeled orange left in the sun. The doctor said that the tussle hadn’t helped his condition. “In fact, if I may take an educated guess, maybe it was even detrimental.” My father had Alzheimer’s and for a while things might seem normal, but he would have problems forming new memories. Eventually he would start losing his old memories as well. “Though it isn’t always chronological,” the doctor said. Outside we could hear the sirens of an emergency vehicle swimming up the thin streets of the city. “Better not to be making memories right now anyway,” my father said. I became my father’s caretaker. Because I am a woman, because he is my father, because in Italy my husband found a job first, because I had two extra heaps of patience in me—yet the main reason, though it was never spoken, was because I had worked in a hospital back in Istanbul, but I’d been a specialized contractor, not a doctor or nurse in the system. I was a psychologist, which ironically was the last sort of doctor my father needed, though everyone always noted how lucky he was to have a brain expert for a daughter. I was never the lucky one in these statements. I never pointed out that he needed a neurologist and a physical therapist more than he needed me. At most, I could help the people around him process their emotional responses to his jarring temper changes—but I was the only person around him. And although I didn’t hold his fits against him, everything takes its toll. Now I am in a foreign country, crawling on the floor of the ocean without bones built for the pressure. Some days, my father would muster up some normalcy and pretend all was well (or maybe, gruesomely, he wasn’t pretending at all and was just gone), trying to make himself a bit of lunch as I cleaned the flat. But he was childlike in the way he interacted with the objects around him. He sat me down and said “Lunch,” which made me happy because he was lucid and present. He gave me a big bowl of salad. I took a bite and spat it out, which didn’t bother him. He did the same, spitting it all over the table with a smile, though maybe he was only mimicking me. Instead of grabbing the bottle of oil to drizzle over it, he had grabbed a bottle of whiskey. A lot of salad was ruined, and I know it doesn’t cost much, but I was thinking of the waste in euros. I told him to clear the table so I could go back to cleaning. He grabbed the salt shaker, but upside down, and walked back to the kitchen and then to the toilet with it, putting it in the medicine cupboard and scattering a path of salt behind him. These were the worst days, because he was active; it was hard to ignore him when he got out of his chair and puttered about. When he sat still and watched television, though, he was more like a stuffed animal or delicate vase, and could do me no injury. Today, after making sure he had a bowl of oatmeal and his medications, after taking him for a short walk around the apartment and tucking him into his big chair, I told him that I loved him. “I believe you,” he whispered. “I mean it.” “I believe you.” “You don’t recognize me,” I said. “I believe you!” he shouted. Before I realized, I was back under the tarp and in the prison and shaking as I talked to myself, bringing my voice out from its hiding place. I moved a few of the boxes around and the table and little chair that were part of a dining set. It was pleasing to be in this space, because it felt so full of air, so completely stuffed with air that I could swallow a big gulp, a never-ending gulp of it, and live somehow fresher and more complete with this infinite breath rattling around inside me. Then the guard came by in his mustache. “What is happening here? Oh no, you can’t! I said don’t cause a ruckus, and what is this you are doing if not a bona fide ruckus, my God!” “I haven’t done anything,” I said. “I’ve just rearranged the furniture.” “There isn’t supposed to be any furniture. But don’t say anymore. I don’t want to know it. I want to be able to say: ‘I don’t know anything.’ All my life, this is all I wanted to say. All through my school years, I studied and worked so hard to be able to say ‘I don’t know anything,’ and look at you coming around to ruin it.” Even just this little conversation in Turkish had the golden butterflies in my throat whirring with joy. Immediately I was warmed and comforted despite the concrete, and I realized I was breathing air that had come down from the steppes of Anatolia, swept in from over the Black Sea, and though we were securely trapped inside a prison, I felt I could taste the hints of brine and juniper trees, and I wanted to swallow up this sensation, eat it ungingerly. The guard stormed off, but I begged him to come back, to talk with me, to shout anything at me, to tell me where he was from. I pressed my face into the gap of two bars, squeezed my cheeks against them. I begged him to come back. I shouted down the hall, “Please, mister watchman, come back and tell me about your neighborhood”—whether it was one of those quiet squares on the fringes of the city; or if it was in an apartment complex on the high streets of Istanbul; or if it was provincial, with peasant faces flashing at the windows. North of the city, along the coast, there are tumbledown houses and sheds standing in their huddles. You can see them with binoculars during a pleasure cruise on the Bosporus. As you come in from the Black Sea, the city reveals itself in gradients of hills pouring into the water. Peel back this layer to see Bebek—now Arnavutköy, now Kuruçeşme—all green with white houses, like marble stairs down their hillsides. Some days the water is thick and dark as velvet; others days, it is flat and bright in the sun, and other days still it is silvery as an eel in a shallow inlet, and in the faltering dusk I have seen it burn like copper, and in the misty mornings it has vanished and the city feels on the cusp of infinity. I can almost see the hills of the old city, fat with ancient domes bubbling over them, and, closer, the slender, prickly tips of minarets—and now in my prison cell I feel cold and wet, and I am sucked out of my daydream to find the floor drowned in briny water. I laugh and the water gathers its skirts into two bunches and twirls its hem to lap at my ankles and I am terrified. I shout to the guard, “Help, I will drown!” And the water turns inscrutably dark and I can see a cloud bank gathering on the ceiling, and I can feel now the coarse, stony beach of Istanbul at my feet, my toes curling pebbles into their pockets. I must shout, I must shout to the guard, something is happening to my room, it is filling up now with more water, pike and seabream, eels and gulls, and now a fisherman’s pole and line, and the far-off peal of a ferry horn, and the scent of fresh expectancy, and the silver of Istanbul under a bracing and pleasant rain. I throw open my door and retreat to my bedroom, hurrying to close out everything in the prison cell, but when I retrieve my hair dryer for my wet clothes, I find everything is dry already and nothing as it should be. I must have gone too long without food, or maybe I was dehydrated, and imagined everything. Well, yes, I had imagined everything, it was a daydream after all, but I did not know of any daydreams that were in the habit of slipping out of the mind and becoming real. I missed Istanbul. That was how I explained it. You’ll believe anything when you need comfort. But how then had my husband, that night as I tried very hard to fall asleep, without success, pulled a small seashell (still with a bit of gritty mud in its aperture) from my hair and held it up to the darkness like an answer? For a long time, I thought I was a bad daughter because we didn’t leave. A good daughter would’ve forced their parents out of the country that had tried to kill them. Meanwhile, once a week, my husband pleaded that we go on a vacation to Germany or France or England, one from which he had no intention of returning. He was terrified, perhaps selfishly, of staying—more afraid for himself than for my father, but I should’ve been scared too. In truth, I had not ever considered leaving. Not once in all the mess that grew around us had I thought that we must escape, even when everything exploded in July 2016. I knew someone who had been killed in the coup attempt. It was rare, despite the number of people out, despite the tanks, despite the jets and helicopters, despite all the soldiers nervous with guns. But I knew a young woman who had been shot 100 meters from the Bosporus Bridge. Six other people in the street with her also had been shot dead. Everyone ran away except the soldiers, who barricaded the bridge, but the people came back and pulled the soldiers down from their tanks and trucks and beat them. A few weeks later, I was fired from my contractor position in the hospital. I had attended a prep school with somewhat dubious ties to the putschists and their ideologues. My father used to say they would arrest anyone. He had been arrested once before after all, but was let out a year later. He used to say they’d throw you in jail for a bad joke, and while that was true, it had happened before, it had never felt overwhelming. Then, after the coup attempt, they really were arresting everyone. It didn’t matter if you were a semi-famous writer, or a pop singer with too much flamboyance, or just a third-grade teacher. They arrested 50 journalists in the first two weeks after the coup attempt. Then the governmental decrees came out—a list of names of everyone who was now dismissed from their jobs as state officials, academics, journalists, teachers and doctors in state programs, and military cadets and officers. They’d post them on an outdated-looking website, and everyone would search to see if their name was on it. In less than three years, 150,348 people were dismissed. They shut down 3,192 schools, universities, and media outlets, and arrested 319 journalists; they are among 94,975 people who have now been arrested on charges of treason and terrorism. They were building endless prisons to keep up with it. They made people form long queues before judges for sentencing, before they arrested the judges and sentenced them too. Inexplicably, we stayed in Turkey. I was unwilling to believe in freighted circumstances. My father was still, for the most part, his old self, which was a great comfort. The doctors had made it all sound rather bleak, yet here he was getting through his days without much trouble. Even his physical injuries had healed well, and he was back on his feet. It fills me with so much regret thinking back on it, because these were the times of posterity, or whatever you want to call it. I could have talked to him and made meaning of things with him. Then, one late summer day, with the heat stretched, rippling, over the sky, he came to visit me in our flat in Ortaköy. It had originally been his, and his father’s before that, but after Mom died, he couldn’t stand it anymore, and with a bit of his savings he’d squirreled away, he bought himself a small place in Üsküdar. He was having dinner with us and called into the kitchen for my mother. My husband and I were stunned. He called again into the silent kitchen, asking her to come out and eat with us. “Don’t you love us, darling?” And suddenly I was terrified. My father surprised me at the doorway as I was sneaking back out from under the tarp and into the bedroom. “Why have you moved the chair?” he demanded. “I didn’t move the chair. It’s where it has always been,” I said. “It was never there. It was in the back room, not this one.” I walked him to the chair and told him this was a different flat. We weren’t in Istanbul anymore. I said it like I wanted to hurt him with this information, and regretted it immediately because I could see his tangle of thoughts come loose and become organized for a moment. “I know we’re not in Istanbul,” he shouted at me. “I know it every day, because I am miserable here. You have kidnapped me and taken away my family and for what? Why do you hate me, huh?” “I don’t hate you,” I said. “You do.” “I don’t.” “That’s why you have moved my chair. And you don’t listen. And you’ve changed the hallway now!” The spool came undone. He was in Istanbul again. “Dad, you have to eat something.” “I ate,” he said distrustfully. “You must eat something more than a baked potato and some popcorn. Come on. That’s why you feel sick all the time.” “I’m not sick.” “Dad.” “Stop calling me that. I’m not your father. I don’t know who your father is.” I sighed because we’d done this before. I had, in the past, tried to convince him it was me, his daughter. It never went anywhere. “You’re important to me.” He thought for a while, or at least looked like he was thinking. Sometimes it was hard to tell what was going on in these pauses that felt like an actor getting into character, but then never delivering his lines. “You’re someone who is important to me too, aren’t you?” he said at last. “Eat up.” “This is not correct.” I sometimes think about the meaning of a soul. Not some poetic thing, but as close as one could get to a scientific description. I think whatever a soul is, it is the thing dementia takes away. It has left this vessel that is my father, that looks like him and smells like him, but he can’t interact with his surroundings anymore. He is digging and digging and digging to find a fragment of meaning, and I convince myself that so long as this is happening, he still has his soul and is still him, but what will it mean when the mine of his self is exhausted? When he is a corpse that still breathes, still sees—what will I do? How much it hurts to watch someone dissolve beneath their own skin. I find these puddles of happiness in the prison cell. Like entering a hallucination. Like taking a heady sip of ether, and the cell becomes glutted with light, and I am squeezed by thick panes of sunshine though there are no windows. The cell becomes a concert hall of street sounds: clay tavla discs slapping wooden boards, the tootling of small car horns, the winsome peals of white gulls in their gyres. Who wouldn’t wish to stay? When we left, something about my dad’s memory, something about how he conflated things with the past, kept me feeling safe—like we were bringing a little of the old Istanbul with us. It wasn’t so bad to be leaving our homes, it wasn’t so bad to be entering a sort of exile, it wasn’t so bad that our homeland felt like it was in ruins, because we had a little old man carrying its halcyon days in a kerchief on a stick. His voice came from before all the loss. The way he talked was a bridge to our lives left behind. Maybe that is what we do—the children, I mean: We make our parents into portals. Things are changing now, and they don’t affect him. They renamed the Bosporus Bridge a few days after the coup attempt. People think it is an act of remembering, of honoring. But it is a forgetting. The way a state orchestrates rememberings is the same way that it orchestrates forgettings. Possibilities are limited when a country organizes its memory. I had not noticed how easily state architecture conspires against the people. Indeed, I doubt I would recognize Istanbul at all anymore. I hear from friends I desperately wish had run away as I had that the government is building more and more skyscrapers, and uprooting ancient trees for greater swaths of steel-and-stucco malls, car parks, and sports clubs. Sometimes I think even the shoreline has betrayed me. I have a photo I revisit often, of my girlfriends and me on a café patio in the hills overlooking the water, but I can’t remember the name of the place, and have searched Google Street View for hours at a time only to find that the shoreline in the picture not only doesn’t exist, but is entirely impossible (an inlet where it shouldn’t be, Dolmabahçe on the wrong side of the strait). The country is changing—quickly, quickly all the streets are shedding their shops, and the hills are obscured by malls, and the shore is gone behind a curtain of renovations and construction projects, and the newspapers and TV programs are dwindling, and the journalists and artists are going into their prisons with satisfied frowns, and the lira is plummeting, and refugees are growing in number and desperation, and the place names are shifting, hardly noticed as phases of the moon, and my father is immune to all of it now. My father’s head is getting lighter. His brain is shrinking the way a sponge dries into a brittle form. Eventually, it will weigh so little, it might bounce off his body into the ceiling or an errant window and escape from us. What will be in it then? What parts of him have already evaporated? What is the weight of a memory? This morning I found my father stripped naked save for his socks, sitting on the toilet with the door flung wide open. That must have been when the notion first struck me: Because he had already mastered the art of publicly defecating, the best place for him would be the prison cell in my room. But this thought wasn’t as clear as it sounds at first. It wasn’t until after I’d helped him clean himself, led him back to his room, and laid out his clothes that my reaction coalesced into a clear notion that truly, the best place for someone like my father, the best place for someone without any memories, is a prison. Or rather, the person best suited for a prison is one without any memories. They will get their meals. They’ll get their medications. They don’t have rent due, or checks to remember to put in little envelopes and send to the utility companies. They can get air and exercise in the yard without getting lost (as long as you aren’t a violent criminal or a political prisoner, anyway). In fact, I realized that minimum-security prisons were a step above hospice care; they were largely the same thing, with the same expectations of mistreatment, but the prisons were free. For the past few days, I have been growing this idea in me the way an oyster grows a pearl, that the worst aspect of prison is how each day becomes so monotonously remembered; each repetitive boredom becomes a heavy, heavy burden, so massive that its gravity starts to blot out other aspects of oneself, of other, happier memories. That’s the true torture of prison—how it replaces you from the inside out with the impossible weight of monotony, until you lose the person you were before, you lose their joys and sorrows and hopes, and you become a prison cell incarnate. Hollow yet heavy. The prison started filling up. The guard was hardly ever around anymore, which allowed me some freedom to do as I wished with the things I brought into the cell. He must have been busy, what with all the new arrests they were making. I learned about it from the women walking by to their cells. Then, at night, when the prison lights went out, I asked the dark hallway what it was like in Turkey these days. I could read the paper, I wasn’t trapped in prison like these women, but life doesn’t happen in the news. “Oh, sister, it is bad. I got three years for telling my neighbor I had to raise my prices for inflation. I should’ve kept it to myself.” “That’s nothing,” a little girl said. “Aunties, I promise I wasn’t doing anything at all, and I was arrested for saying that I couldn’t afford tomatoes.” I listened for a while, they were scared women after all, and I was just a few steps away from another country altogether, but I found it tiresome—more than that, boring. I didn’t want to hear these things; I really didn’t care about their misfortunes, which were like a hiccup in the heart. I wanted to hear about their neighborhoods, their cities and villages. I wanted them to tell me about the new restaurants in Bebek and the ones that had stayed afloat. I wanted them to tell me that they had smuggled in a piece of pistachio marzipan and would share it, morsel by indulgent morsel, with me. I wanted to hear that their relatives, when allowed visitations, would bring a few packs of Turkish cigarettes, tea from Rize, a bit of simit. I wanted these women to pick up old conversations with me, and reveal that they were my friends from my university days, friends who had made it through turbulent times unscathed and still aglow even as they were caged. I wanted these women to say, “Oh my, how we’ve missed you, but of course everything is fine now; please return at once, please return to your flat at the top of the street, and we’ll throw you a never-ending party with so much champagne it becomes us, golden and sparkling.” Selfishly, I couldn’t be bothered for the minutiae of their tribulations, because I knew they would be the same as my own if I were ever to return to Turkey. Indeed, I was in Turkey now; I was in the very prison they would send me to as soon as I alighted from the plane and showed them my passport. At least in this cell I could leave. At least this cell was one of wonders and magic that, according to its merciful designs, brought Istanbul to me. Even now, as I was dreaming of the rich and so unbelievably fine marzipan from my favorite baker in Kuruçeşme, the prison cell produced in its corner a plate of five rolls of it, and I ate them up quickly, knowing they would disappear should I try to bring them home. Maybe I was foolish, but it caught me by surprise when my husband found out about the prison in our bathroom. He became a whirlwind in the house, knocking over the lamps, a few little decorative dishes from their tables, all of my father’s medical apparatuses. He stuffed a few items into a hard-shell suitcase—a book he was reading, his crossword puzzles he never finished, the tea bags, his watch and trousers, but mostly loads of underwear, all his underwear. Before I could say a word to him, he fled the flat, crashing down the staircase with a bunch of thuds like an awkward drum roll. A half hour or so later—after enough time had passed that my husband could have feasibly run to the train station, checked the timetables, waited in the queue, and bought a ticket, and could now be boarding a train bound for Milan or Turin and then one out of Italy altogether—I had just started to say to myself I was now husbandless and alone, when jumping through the door was my husband again, his face carved with dread, saying, “What are you doing? Aren’t you coming too?” I laughed (perhaps from shame or some other deep feeling opaquely buried in my soil) and pulled him by the arm into the flat, though I didn’t embrace him. “We can’t stay,” he insisted. “Why not?” I asked. “You’re being purposefully obtuse, I see.” “Just sit down and listen for a minute.” He refused. He said we were being driven out of the country, that Turkey wants us dead, or worse. He said the prison attached to our bedroom must be some new development by the Interior Ministry to hunt down political enemies. He said my father was in no condition to be in jail. He said I wouldn’t like it much either. He said these things as if I didn’t know them too. “Please, just give it a little while. Everything will be fine.” Nothing about this felt like it would turn out well for me, and yet I couldn’t help wanting to stay. My husband said, as if falling into the sky: “Wouldn’t it be nice if you could get away to where your father can’t hurt you anymore?” But it sounded like he was inviting me to my own funeral. Pain is life after all, along with its glittering treasures. Painlessness is death, and I have my very own father as evidence. “Oh no, no. I can’t do this. I have to leave, and quickly. What about my acids? I have to go before my ulcer …” And my husband was gone. When your brain shrivels up and has finished erasing everything, there is no longer any weight atop you. There are no felicitous nostalgias eating my father’s body from the inside out, like corrosion. His wife is no longer dead. She hardly even existed now. Soon she will be gone entirely. The last thing left is the shape of these memories. And he will erase this by disentangling the words he used to know her by, the acts he used to love her by, from all their meaning. It is the same for his country. Soon his confusions will end. Looking out the window, he won’t see his old neighborhood anymore. He won’t see the hills of Ortaköy from our living room anymore. And he won’t see Italy either. He’ll be lost at last, and his memories will have popped out of his head and be left to wander on their own doomed journeys. I envy him, but do not, in truth, desire the same fate, even if Istanbul seems to desire it out from under me, the way the city conspired to change. But I have not been fidelitous toward my country, so why shouldn’t it change? “While my back is turned, you become someone else!” I accuse it, but it replies, “To say while your back is turned implies that it will turn round again.” I don’t want to miss my country anymore. I don’t want to be afraid of becoming a tomb. I don’t want unrevisitable memories. I want a self-renovation of the soul. I want a cleansing wave like the controlled burns on the steppes, the immolations that remove the thistles and noxious weeds. I want to take up a drip torch and set fire to my insides until everything that is gold and glittering has turned to charcoal—an act of preservation, charred against rot and decay. I piled a few provisions by the bathroom door, small things you might take on a hike if you weren’t the sort of person who normally hiked: a bag of chocolates, a bottle of soda water, a sleeve of crackers, a few blocks of white cheese, instant coffee. Next to these I folded up a bundle of clothes and my toiletries and some good books. In a huge bucket I mixed mortar. All prepared, I chucked my things into the prison cell and started stacking bricks and spreading mortar. From inside the prison, I built a wall sealing me off from my bedroom, sealing me in the cell, the prison, Turkey. Maybe they will let me out in a few years. Maybe, if the regime is ousted, there’ll be a general pardon like there used to be. I slathered all the mortar, then mixed up some more and started the second wall of bricks covering the first. As I went, I could feel the breeze come off the Bosporus and the sun climb high overhead, where it stayed perched as I worked, but it was not unpleasant—in fact, the boughs of a few judas trees came to cover me and fill me with the sweet scent of their new leaves. When I reached for another brick, I saw that the floor around me was suddenly a cobblestone esplanade over the Bosporus, where jellyfish and little darting creatures bobbed about the surface. Behind me now was the gleaming Ortaköy Mosque, with the high, sweeping line of the bridge beyond it. Before me were the walled gardens and apartments of a palace, and deeper into the mist came the familiar rolling hills of the old city, flat as paper on my eyes. I could hear the fishmongers shout out their prices, and I watched the caïques and tankers lolling across the sea. As I placed the last brick, I could taste the brine and the flower buds and the spices from the bazaar. I could hear the gulls and the motorway. I saw fishermen fix their nets in the sun and lovers tear their hair out at the scope of their affections. All of it was crammed, crammed into the cell. All of the city was in there with me—all of the country. It swirled in a great and terrible form, as if everything I had ever loved and feared had been scooped out of me and thrown into a kaleidoscope. My body was in a cell in Silivri Prison, and it would now never leave."

        "story": "A story During Donnie’s first week in the mixed unit (drugs and crazy), a girl threw a TV set out the window because she thought it was criticizing her. Donnie walked to the window to look. “Probably was,” he mumbled. He’d grown up with a mother who came alive when insulted. The guy sleeping across the room, who’d dealt heroin with his own now-jailed dad, was woken up by the noise and asked, “Are we dead yet?” “No. You’re just sleeping,” Donnie told him, and the boy’s eyes closed again; his thin arm, with a tattoo of a serpent, hung over the side of the bed. In the southwest corner of the unit, a girl had turned into a horse. She moved on all fours, neighing. Rearing. You had to walk around her. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. Donnie had been terrified when his sister and brother had left him at the hospital, off in a remote wing of the place where their mom had been for years now. The whole first month, the staff wouldn’t let him visit her. He didn’t want her seeing him like this anyway. He wondered if she knew he was here, or if she still pictured him in the town on the hill, finishing up his sophomore year of college. Instead, they were together in this run-down, not-built-right hospital compound in Norwalk, California, in 1981—the bottom of the world. All day, he was herded into groups with the other drug people, where they told their stories of how they’d become bad. They allowed Sylvie, his dog, to accompany him. Others talked; Donnie kept quiet. It made sense that he’d ended up here. He’d been aiming at something for a long time—he just hadn’t understood that this place was the target. He liked being on the same grounds as his mom. Even if she didn’t know he was here. Some moments, remembering that she was less than a mile away, he felt safe. The police had found him on the beach, south of LAX, with a cluster of homeless people and Sylvie. Months earlier, he’d followed some kids to the beach. They taught him to surf. It felt like being clobbered in a fight, and then he washed up onshore, somehow still whole. The rest of the day, his body felt looser. They made fires at night and, around those circles, a joint traveled hand to hand. Donnie passed it along. Until he didn’t. From one toke to being high all the time took only a heartbeat. That was one of the ways to know that he was an addict, they told him in the unit. Most people came from families of addicts, but his had insanity, not addiction. His mother had sipped crème de menthe from a tiny glass once in a blue moon. But he was marked. Lina and Walter, his sister and brother, had always wondered if he was their full brother. Maybe somewhere in the world he had a junkie dad. Would’ve explained a lot. Everyone in high school had found out what happened to his mother. He’d never told, but they knew. Girls wanted to talk about it, their voices pitying, hands eager. For the first time, he had the impulse to punch a person. He never touched those girls who wanted to soothe him. He turned remote because he would have liked to hurt them. The unit had incredibly glossy floors. Public schools used these same tiles, but they gave no shine. Donnie asked one of the hospital janitors how he kept it up. A block of wood covered with a towel at the end of a pole was all. They let Donnie keep one in his room to polish his hall. He liked the back-and-forth motion. He did the homework here, in a way he hadn’t in college. Caseworkers shuffled the group into a van bound for a gym, off grounds. After the third Thursday, he asked the trainer—a pert, tiny, muscular mother of three—if she could write down a program for him to do by himself. “Do you ever run? That’s how I get my cardio. You’re outside; you see things.” He’d hated going around the track in school, hated the gym clothes. But now he built the habit every morning and, by the fourth week, felt the return loop of reward. Sylvie began to trot along. Running was the first habit he learned in rehab that he knew he could maintain. By then he had seen his mom and told her that he lived here now too, within the same chain-link fence. He called it the Humble Place. He told her only what he knew she could take. He told her how Sylvie had saved him. His mother patted the dog. Animals had always gone to her instinctively. He and the rest of the group prepared for family week. Donnie had never been part of the drama department in high school, but remembering how his classmates had cycled through adrenaline to exhaustion, he thought this must be like what went into the annual Shakespeare play, only real, the long rehearsals culminating not in a performance but in face-to-face revelations and apologies, not conversations exactly, because they were so practiced. You were talking with the people who meant the most to you, who’d now seen into the box of your failures. Your betrayals, your lies, your greed, your cheating—they could pick them out one by one to examine. Julie, his mom’s friend from nursing school, owed him nothing, but she still came for the week. When their mother had gone into the hospital, Walter was already at Berkeley, and Julie took in Donnie and Lina. Julie had laughed with Donnie, told him her daily news, learned to cook what he liked. They’d watched movies together, eating Jiffy Pop and almond brittle, most nights of the week. But then he’d stopped and left her alone to worry while he was out destroying himself. Not that it had felt that way at the time. He’d prepared a long letter to read to Julie, but she didn’t let him get through it. She wanted to take the blame from him, to make it all her fault. His brother was a cipher, as always. Walter went for a walk with Donnie on the grounds, and when they sat down, he said, “You know how when we were growing up, I was considered, like, at least in the family, smart?” Walter said. “When I got to college, I found other people way better at school than me. Even Lina. She likes all that. I’m good at finding things that have fallen apart and making something out of the pieces. I fix up old buildings so they can be used again. Maybe when you’re done with all this, you can come work with me.” Later, when Donnie talked to Lina, she kept trying to jump down into the well of the past with him. She saw them as twins. And she was this goody-goody! He’d never been like that. At his next meeting with Trish, his caseworker, she wanted to help figure out what jobs he should look for; she had a list of shops that hired kids from the unit. But Donnie hoped to work here, on the hospital grounds. “Because you want to see your mom?” “Yes. Other things too. I want to be near her kind of people.” Trish seemed to take this as an acceptable answer. A calm seeped into him. After putting in some calls, Trish found only one opening, in geriatrics. The head nurse there would take him but not the dog. “We’ve got more than enough incontinence,” she said. “Sylvie’s house-trained,” Donnie argued, but the nurse wouldn’t budge. Donnie decided to hike over to the adult wards to talk to Shirley, the nurse his mom liked best. Sylvie folded herself into a perfect triangle at his feet as he spoke. “She’s my luck,” he said. Shirley convinced geriatrics to give them a try. When he started, the head nurse put him on diaper detail. “New person always takes it.” Her profile was like the cut side of a key. Donnie had once told a girl who’d asked about his mom that it wasn’t all poetry. The girl had looked at him with pity and romance. But he knew he could handle this, with Sylvie looking up at him. He taught Sylvie to sit near the person’s head. Often a hand would reach down to touch her. He wrote a letter to the only professor he’d actually talked to in college. He said that he hoped to return in a semester, or maybe a year. He was moving to sober living. It had taken Trish a while to locate a place that would allow Sylvie. The house she’d found was in the direction of the college. Donnie would have more freedom, but with that came responsibility. He was strong enough to manage, she said. And he could always pop in to see her. “You’re going to be dazzled by choices. You’ll need your supports. Tell me your dailies.” “I run.” “What else? You’ll find a meeting there. Do you meditate or anything? You know I pray.” “I read. I’ve been reading more.” “You’ll need strong dailies to structure your recovery. Oh, and your house will have its own rules, but one thing we recommend is, and this comes from a lot of experience: For the first year, try to stay away from any romantic involvement.” Donnie laughed. “No problem there.” His last day in the unit, he saw Horsegirl balanced on two feet, looking the way dogs do when they’re made to stand. Chagrined. To go from being a beautiful horse to a mental patient pulled up by your parents: talk about a flat world. He didn’t mind the new place. He called this one Humble House, and he abided by the rules. He ran with Sylvie, five, sometimes six miles a day. He drove his mother’s old car to the hospital for work, where he was assigned not just to diapers but to help care for a very old woman, Ida. He drove out again on Sundays, to visit his mom. She was used to Sundays. Over the summer, Donnie and his mom worked next to each other in the hospital garden for an hour after his geri shift. He weeded and turned the hard soil with a hoe. He bought fertilizer from a nursery, and they scattered the pellets as if they were feeding ducks. They had done that together when he was small. They talked little. One afternoon, his mother said, “See?” and lifted his arm to point out a bird. Until then, Donnie hadn’t noticed birds, but he now grew attentive to their differences. Eventually he found a book in the hospital library. He pointed out birds to her too. At dusk, he identified owls calling from a stand of redwoods. When Donnie or his mom offered a comment, the other would nod or make a noise. Their conversations didn’t catch, the way Lina needed hers to lock and turn together. The hour felt like more than an hour. Clouds stretched thinner. They washed their hands together in the shed when they finished. He took his mother’s hands under the faucet of cold mineral water and scrubbed her fingernails with a brush. He always made her a mug of tea before he left. He set her up with it on a table next to her, in front of the TV. When summer’s end neared, Trish decided it was time for Donnie to move again, closer to the college. “Sober houses are expensive,” she explained. “You’ll be starting school in a semester or two.” She rested her hands on the mound of her now-pregnant belly. Walter came to help him find a room. The 11th place they saw was in a garage, overlooking a garden. Donnie liked the woman renting it out, an assistant professor named Caroline. She was young, and her tanned legs sparkled with blond flecks of hair. Her house was orderly and pretty. Later, Donnie left his boxes on the swept floor of the new place and went out for a long run. Sylvie stopped after a few blocks in the August heat, and she showed no sign of wishing to resume. So after he showered, he took her for a walk. Contentment fell over him in the soft air, his body loose, tugged by the gentle, roving tension of the leash. The geri unit celebrated Ida’s 91st birthday with a cake—but her daughter, whom Donnie had never seen, once again didn’t show. He took pictures, the staff helped Ida blow out candles, and then he walked her to the library, where she could talk to her daughter on the telephone. The key-faced nurse had given him the code to dial long-distance. Donnie wandered over to the metal shelves of periodicals to give Ida privacy, but he could still hear. Ida was keeping the conversation going. She asked questions. The answers seemed short. Finally, he heard “I love you. I hope so,” and then the phone being put down. He asked her if she wanted to walk before going back. She said no, she was tired. “She does her best; she tries,” Ida said. “You see, I wasn’t a good mother.” For a long time, Donnie hadn’t talked about his mother at meetings. She was a box with a lid. But now he began to. The way he wanted to remember her, she was keen-eyed, fun. A very particular person. She didn’t like yellow flowers. “How can you dislike a flower?” someone asked. But he understood; not much of her time had ever been her own. Her likes and dislikes defined her. She could turn a small room beautiful. One night—it felt like ages ago—in a dirty sleeping bag by the thundering surf, Donnie had been alone in the dark, high on LSD. The stars sparkled closer. He wasn’t afraid to be alone. Then he saw a shape that was really there, not a person, just denser air. The height of his mother. She had tried to kill herself; that was why she was in the hospital. The figure stood there, the edge of its density waving a bit in the wind, like the edge of a cloth. Nobody told him, but the waves and the pressing stars and the figure had given him to understand. She’d wanted to die. Telling these people he barely knew about his mother changed him. His life had broken—he’d broken it—and was nearly healed. Now he could feel himself trying to grow. Donnie got stuck on the Steps. He made inventories without much trouble, but when he tried to offer amends, nobody wanted them. Like Julie, his family refused to forgive him; they blamed themselves instead. Lina said they were fine when he told her he needed to apologize. The only person who accepted an apology was his mother. She listened and murmured, “Mm-hmm.” As spring arrived, Donnie felt that he would remember this time as the period when his character was formed. It could have happened anywhere, but it happened here. He was 20 years old, sober, and employed. He saw his mother every week through it all. It could have been anywhere, but it was here that his second life began. When he talked to Caroline about recovery, she asked if he missed drugs. He didn’t think so. “I miss the places they brought me. I don’t have as many revelations.” She also asked about his return to school. He had no idea what to major in. He thought about it while running and afterward in the shower, the hot water voluptuous on his back. In the mixed unit, he’d learned to enjoy restoring order. The rote work of it. He’d spent hours going back and forth polishing that floor. He knew that there was such a thing as beautifully clean. Sylvie was always by him. Donnie made dinner for Caroline and her kids, Lily and Jasper—soba noodles every Monday, with a fried egg for each person (over-easy for Jasper) and snipped herbs from the garden. He didn’t want the summer to end. His mother was rocking in a chair when he asked, “You going to be okay with me going back to college? I wouldn’t be able to see you every day.” She stared at her hands, not answering. “I don’t have to,” he said. “I want you to,” she said slowly. “I wish I had gone for a higher degree.” “You have a degree. You’re a nurse, Mom. You may not have become what you wanted, but what you are gave me my life.” When fall classes started, he saw his mother less often. He was able to drive to the hospital only on Tuesdays and Sundays to wash her hair. He told her about his courses. Sometimes he brought his books along and did homework, reading little bits aloud. Often he’d come across something and say, “I have no idea what that means,” and they’d laugh. They could spend an afternoon together without saying much. When he left, he felt nourished, as if he’d eaten a light but healthy meal. Donnie started to pick her up after his classes on Wednesdays to bring her to his place. He was planning a winter garden bed for them to work in together in Caroline’s backyard. He sat his mother in a lawn chair while he dug. The second Wednesday she came, he and his mother picked up Caroline’s kids from school. Lily and Jasper were sweet with her, taking her hand as she got into the car. In the yard, they brought things over to her in her chair. Tea. A blanket. A peeled orange. For a while, she slept as the three of them moved around her. Donnie prepared a good dinner, but she didn’t eat much. Driving her back to the hospital, he asked whether she’d ever considered moving in with Julie. “No,” she said. Donnie was surprised. “Never.” She shook her head. She could still be adamant. That was a good sign. Caroline suggested that Donnie bring his mother to the house for the week that Shirley, his mother’s favorite nurse, would be on vacation. The kids would be away on a school wilderness trip then, and they could clear out Lily’s room. If it went well, maybe they could reconfigure so she could be there more. Donnie spent days preparing. He carried out six bags of trash, took down curtains and rods, and unscrewed hooks from Lily’s closet. He remembered the phrase danger to oneself or others, the way he’d stopped the first time he’d heard it. His mother had never wanted to hurt them. She’d only been after herself. She probably didn’t need these precautions anymore. Still, he thought he would close her into Lily’s room at night, with a chair shoved under the knob. Just so she couldn’t roam outside in the dark and trip. Two weeks before Donnie’s mother was due to arrive, the next-door neighbor pounded a For Sale by Owner sign into his front lawn. It wasn’t a beautiful house. It was right next door, though; a garden could span both yards. But he was getting ahead of himself. She was just coming to visit. The morning he was to pick her up, Donnie rose early. He diced vegetables for soup and tried to remember the last time he and his mother had lived together. He had been 13 when she’d stopped going to work. The sound of running water and the clatter of pots in the kitchen that had awakened him most days of his life no longer did. When he got home from school, she would still be in bed. He would knock on her door and ask if she’d like some toast. He made cinnamon toast, cut in fours, the way she had before. At the hospital, the paperwork involved in signing her out overnight was time-consuming, and he found her sitting on the edge of her bed. Shirley had packed her suitcase. Finally, when they arrived at Caroline’s house, she seemed disoriented. She asked where the little girl was, though she knew Lily’s name. She didn’t want her soup. She didn’t touch the avocado either, once her favorite food. That night, she had trouble sleeping. She stayed up fretting her hands as Donnie sat with her. Shirley had given him her medicine for each day in a Ziploc bag, and she’d carefully written out the schedule. Caroline had sleeping pills, but they didn’t think they could give one to her without asking a doctor. Julie was supposed to visit the next day. Then, Donnie thought, he could rest. He’d been awake for more than 28 hours. His mother didn’t seem happy to see Julie, but Donnie excused himself for a nap with Sylvie in his room above the garage. That night, while they sat at dinner—Donnie had made risotto with squash from the garden—his mother got up from the table and put her hand on the wall. She said she had to go to bed. It was 5 o’clock. She slept until 10. Then she was up all night again, wanting to walk outside. Donnie took her out on their quiet street. She kept turning to go the other way. He wound up driving her back to the hospital after her fourth night. She seemed relieved to watch her clothes being put back in her cubby. She patted the top of her bed. They went to the community room, and she fell asleep in a chair. Donnie told Shirley about the visit when she returned from her vacation. “We all get used to our routines,” she said. “And then we end up loving them.” “I’m so glad you’re here,” Donnie said to Shirley. Donnie sat with his mother in Ward 301, as he had so many afternoons. “You were a wonderful mother,” he said. “Thank you.” “I did come,” she murmured. “I love you.” “That’s all we have to worry about now. That’s all that’s important.” Those were the last things she said. Then she was gone. Something he hadn’t thought about for years came back to him. His mother had once parked at the end of a dusty road lined with olive trees. This was somewhere in the Central Valley, long ago. A friend of hers was there, with a scarf triangled on her head, tied under her chin. Could that have been Julie? They’d parked behind a flat, one-story building that turned out to be a sanatorium, and his mom was walking toward the entrance. Her friend, who was Julie, he was now sure, acted as if this were a joke, a stunt his mother had cooked up for a laugh. A nun behind the desk gave his mom a clipboard, and she started to fill it out. They had her in the wheelchair already, another nun stationed behind, ready to push her by those two horns down a long, empty hall. Julie said to her, “Come on, let’s go find a place to get ice cream.” And then, at the very last minute, his mother stood up from the chair and walked outside with them, a person rising from a grave. Exhilarating. They drove around looking for ice cream and finally found a stand with strange flavors. Avocado. Date. Donnie understood that she’d come back to life for him.

        "story": "He spent the night making snow. He packed it tightly into balls of different sizes and stored them in the freezer to keep them stable. For a long time, he had wanted to make something so simple and natural that no one would suspect concerted thinking had gone into it. He wanted the greatest possible concentration of thought along with the greatest possible efficiency in the execution of that thought. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. He had come up with many ideas in the past. He would sell dirt. He would be a newspaper vendor, but the newspaper he sold would not exist. He would create one issue of the newspaper, make only 101 copies, and sell them. The stories in the newspaper would be outrageous, improbable, yet perfectly believable. He would insinuate, for example, that human beings were disappearing, and that more aliens existed among us than at any other time in history. The paper’s events would make people doubt their reality or the reality of the society in which they lived. He would have an ad for a great dirt sale, giving the impression that people lined up every other week to buy dirt from different parts of the country. He would have another item about a 55-year-old flea, accompanied by a blown-up photograph, giving it a half-familiar, half-grotesque appearance, evoking both the art of William Blake and the largely credible pictures in National Geographic. But the more he considered such an elaborate scheme, the more he felt that its very elaborateness disqualified it from the true naturalness that authentic conception, raised to the status of art, must have. He abandoned such baroque imaginings. He wanted something childlike. This made him think about childhood, about what’s missing from it and how the city robs children of wonder. He wanted to be a dealer in wonders. But he wanted the wonders to be so ordinary that their very ordinariness would be inseparable from their power to astonish. He made a long list of the most ordinary things. He had done dirt. But dirt was not in itself wonderful. He had done flotsam, bottles, human hair. He had worked with the topography of body and skin, had imprinted the mythology of his color on paper. He had made his physical existence its own work of art. He had explored basketball and heights, had made art out of the dust of his favorite rough, urban streets. Using the detritus of society, he had explored the limits of the conceptual. He now wanted something innocent. But the more you looked into that innocence, the more ambiguous and complex it became, until it encompassed everything he had been trying to say for most of his working life. Where was he going to find such a natural and transparent object? The object had to defeat thought while endlessly stimulating it. But the object also had to be at the center of an event that could never be duplicated, that had happened only once—and then vanished—and whose occurrence would be a rumor. He wanted an event that everyone could enter, but that only a few people would experience at the time it happened. So many possibilities to be contained in a single, simple object. For years now, he had been going to a part of the city where people sold the most unexpected things. He often wandered the market in search of materials that the streets had yielded. He had discovered that the refuse, the mountains of rubbish the city disposed of every day, was his most precious resource. It was more valuable to him than expensive works of art, created with expensive materials and costly assistants. At the beginning of his wanderings, he was amazed by what people threw away. He had found perfectly functioning computers and television sets, radios and microwaves. He had unearthed paintings and posters from famous exhibitions, brochures from art galleries, papers from law firms, the complete 1922 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and books of every conceivable quality. He had rescued old Ornette Coleman records and an incomplete set of the tales of Chester Himes. He had uncovered maps and diaries and tap-dance shoes; evening dresses and top hats and a new pair of suspenders. He had found these among the garbage, the mess of decomposing vegetables and foul garnishes, the broken eggshells and the drool of yogurt and other mucuslike substances. He had dug out reams of government documentation about plans to restrict immigration, had marveled at the abandoned notes of a private detective and love letters that had been thrown away when that love had irrevocably died. He had become a specialist in scouring the city’s waste. He had a warehouse on the outskirts where he stored all that he found. On some evenings he went around with a large shopping cart stacked with everything he had collected. People always took him for a regular tramp, or for one of the mentally disturbed who ransacked trash cans and pushed their loaded carts around the city all night. It was in the course of his wanderings that he had discovered this informal market where folks sold the most outlandish things. On his first visit, he was astonished to find a lean, toothless man selling false teeth. Rows of them were laid out on a makeshift table. He had teeth for children and for women. He had a full row of dog and horse teeth. Next to him, another man sold eyepieces. On a table he displayed monocles and strange wire eyeglasses. He even had glass eyes. Some were large, some small, and almost all of them blue. Not far from him, a man sold oddly shaped mangoes from South America alongside huge, bulbous avocados. Behind him someone sold clothes for giants. Next to him, another sold baby shoes. He watched them and went among them. He bought a glass eye and had a chat with the man who sold false teeth. “What’s your name?” “Joe.” “How long you been here?” “Today?” “No, selling here.” “Couple of months.” “Sell well?” “We do all right.” “I’m looking to sell stuff.” “Yeah, what d’you sell?” “Dirt.” “Real dirt?” “Real dirt.” “Hey, Nathan. Come over. This guy sells dirt.” Nathan came over. He was the one who sold baby shoes. “You sell dirt?” “Yeah. Where do you find your baby shoes?” “In the bins. Where do you find your dirt?” “In the streets.” “Good one. You don’t have to rob no one for dirt, do you?” “Guess not.” “Come sell here,” said Joe, the false-teeth man. “Yeah?” “Every other Sunday. You just set yourself up and that’s it. You mind your business, we mind ours.” “That simple, yeah?” “That simple.” “Great. I’ll come by.” “Can’t wait to see your dirt.” He went there every other Sunday for the next three months. He never sold anything; he just went to hang out with the oddball traders. He wore a coarse coat with an ascot and beat-up shoes. Half tramp, half jazzman. He could be either, depending on who was looking at him. He got used to the rough humor of the traders and they got used to his sly, elusive ways. “When you going to start selling dirt?” said the false-teeth man. “When the weather’s right.” “There’s a blizzard coming. You better start collecting dirt now or you won’t be able to find it. You know how the city gets covered when it snows.” “Dirt man here’s got to find the right kind of dirt, yeah?” said baby shoes. “That must be hard.” The traders laughed. He laughed wryly with them. “Right kind of dirt is the hardest thing in the world to find. Harder than finding gold.” “How hard can it be to find the right kind of dirt?” asked baby shoes. “Takes the right kind of eyes. And that ain’t common.” “It sure ain’t,” said baby shoes, and they all roared again with laughter. Two days before the next market day, a thick blanket of snow covered the city, its cars and skyscrapers, its fields and lampposts. At home, he watched the snow coming down. He went for a walk and saw the city under a pall—under a spell—of whiteness. What if snow were black? he thought. Now that would be something. When snow fell, it would be like night raining down. The houses and the trees and the cars and the roads would be covered in blackness. They’d be singing of a black Christmas. They’d make black snowmen. It would create a different mythology. He mused on this as he wandered the city. The sidewalks were under sheets of snow. Winter kept us warm. He watched children in a nearby field throwing snowballs at one another. A fist-size snowball missed its target and whacked him in the chest. The kids were scared by what they’d done and ran off laughing and screaming, imagining that he was after them. He picked up the broken ball of snow and repacked it and took it home with him, still musing. Covering Earth in forgetful snow. At home he made two phone calls. The people who received the calls were puzzled by his instructions. One was to bring a camera to a certain place at a certain time. “Do not talk to me like you know me. Just take pictures. Be as inconspicuous as possible. Blend in. Don’t be like a goddamn tabloid photographer. You were just going past and you saw something that caught your eye and you took pictures of it and then you moved on.” “Is that it?” said the photographer. “Pretty much.” “What’s it about?” “You don’t need to know. Better if you don’t know. Just be there.” And to the other caller he said: “You free on that day?” “Yeah, sure. What’s it about?” “Just show up. Don’t act like you know me. Buy something. Stick around for a bit. Then move on.” “Up to your stuff again?” “Something like that.” “One day you’re going to get into trouble pulling stunts.” “If life ain’t trouble, what’s the point of it?” They laughed and he put the phone down. He sat by the window and watched the snow falling. He tried to make out a single flake as it formed, and then he tried to follow the downward trajectory. The flakes were like cataracts falling over the eye. He watched the forms the snow made of the stationary cars. Some of them looked like giant hats in the street. He thought about snow: It’s all in there. All the contradiction’s in there. Is it one thing or another? Is it the sky’s fault that snow is white? The whiteness of the whale. How much should a snowflake cost? If nature were selling snow, how much would we need to spend to decorate the whole city with it, how much for the bridal garment of the cathedral, how much for the mantle on the Statue of Liberty? If a gram of snow were the same price as a gram of gold, how much would it cost us to deck the city in splendor? Gone are the snows of yesteryear. Everyone has a memory of snow. Most enchanting thing in the world. The priceless marvel that falls without a sound. Stilling the city and making silence audible. Not the snowmen that melt and, before they vanish, turn ugly and lumpish; not the curves of snow on church domes and telegraph wires, but maybe the way the heart jumps with delight when you step out in the dark or in the morning into the soft miracle of its revelation as it changes the visible world into an innocent paradise that children love. Can’t put a price on it. How do you put a price on that compression of the sky? Then it melts and is gone, an evanescent memory, fragile like beauty, leaving its midway state and returning to one of the primal elements. Too precious for art. Put it in an art gallery or a museum, and it makes no sense. Exposes the fraudulence of making and pricing. A little piece of transcendence and ephemerality, all in a little flake, the pollen of winter. What complexity is contained in it—commerce, class, race, design, spirituality, fragility, tenderness, childhood, nature, surprise, wonder. Neither ice nor water; part air, part dream. Spirit substance. Black kids in the snow. That indefinable happiness in which the history of the brutalization of bodies is dissolved. Snow equalizes the heart. Perhaps the only truly democratic thing in this divided republic. Life, liberty, and the perfection of snow. He left the window. “I got my next thing,” he said to his wife, in the bedroom. “Yeah, what is it?” “It’s going to happen and no one will see it. Then it will be a rumor. Then there will be these bits of evidence that it took place. Not a single curator, gallery owner, or museum director will be anywhere near it. Only kids and passersby, the poor, the simple, people who don’t look at art and don’t give a fuck what it is. It will be the most democratic show in the country. It will take place under a bridge, near hoboes and dropouts, drug dealers and tramps. No one will know they are looking at it. Because it will be something so simple and ordinary that it will look like everything else, except for a few tiny details. Then it will be over, as if it had never happened. “Afterwards, 20 times more people than were there will claim to have been there. What is nothing will become something, and it will become more something with the passing of years, as the event itself fades into oblivion and becomes either a myth or nothing. The years will pass and everything will become old, but this thing that may or may not have happened will become more real and at the same time more strange. “I always wanted to do something that will work with the passing of time itself, and I think I’ve found a way. It’s going to be about everything and nothing. It’s going to be about whatever you want it to be about. And yet no one’s going to be able to lay a finger on it. It’ll be like snowflakes, evanescent; and like dreaming, persistent; and like a stone wall, tangible.” The wife stuck her head out from the bedroom. “How you going to do all that?” But he didn’t reply, because he was watching the dance of snowflakes falling onto the black streets. Days later , on a cold Sunday when the snow had stopped falling, people walking past the market under the bridge saw something they had never seen before. They saw the regular sellers of false teeth and baby shoes and clothes for giants. But they also saw a stall where snowballs were laid out on a Moroccan patterned rug of red and orange and blue. The larger ones were at the top, and in a descending scale of size, the smaller ones were lower down. The smallest ones were quite tiny, the size of a wren’s egg, but perfectly white and perfectly round. The snowballs formed their own immaculate pattern against the Moroccan arabesques. At the back of the stall, hovering over the display, was a man in a dark-brown jacket and dark trousers, with a natty ascot and a rimless dark hat. At first glance he looked like a bum. But when you looked at him again, you noticed a certain secret care about his attire. He was talking to the false-teeth trader, and they seemed to be laughing lightly at some joke. Many people went past and could not entirely compute what they were seeing. Some were not sure that they had seen what they had seen. They doubled back to get another look. Then they scratched their heads. A man with a whiskey bottle came by, saw the display, and stopped. “You selling these?” “It’s why I’m here.” “But I could make these myself,” said the man with the whiskey bottle. “You think?” The whiskey man stared at the rows of snowballs and blinked as if he were not seeing right and then staggered away. He paused at the false-teeth stall and bought a pair. Then he went off singing something that resembled a sea shanty. A moment later another man came along, and when he saw the rows of snowballs, he began to laugh. “Only in America,” he said, between laughs. “You selling these for real?” “For real.” “How much?” The price of the snowballs rose with their size, he was told. The smallest was 50 cents and the largest was $1. “A dollar for a snowball?” “Cheap at the price.” The man stared at the pristine rows of snowballs and then at the trader and back at the white rows. He sensed a profound incongruity between the whiteness of the snowballs and the haziness of the trader, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was. “You some kind of magician or something?” “Got to be to stay alive, right?” The prospective client laughed again. He couldn’t control his laughter. He found the whole setup funny but couldn’t say why. The trader watched him, his back against the wall of the run-down bridge. “This is just the best jive I ever seen. If I buy one, it gon’ disappear or something?” “You pay your money, you takes your chances,” the trader said. The man lingered, unable to leave and unable to commit to a purchase. “You into some kind of scam here and I just can’t see what it is. You sold any of these already?” “I done all right,” came the reply. While he hung around, a woman wheeling her son in a stroller saw the snowballs and stopped. The man sloped off. “Can I have a snowball, Mommy?” the boy said. “It depends on if this gentleman is selling them, honey,” she said to the air generally. But she maneuvered the stroller to the front of the stall and looked at the smiling face of the trader. “That’s a bright boy you got there,” he said, not coming forward, his smile going on ahead. “They are magic!” the boy said. “I want one. Can I have one, Mommy?” “Are you selling these snowballs?” “That’s why I’m here.” “Did you make them yourself?” “I think God did, but I lined them up.” “So pretty. Never seen snowballs look so pretty before.” “Can I have one, Mom?” The trader came forward. He looked at the kid, who was sitting in his buggy like a little emperor. Then he said: “Which one would you like?” “A small one. That one,” the boy said, pointing to the lower line of snowballs, to the tiny ones like wrens’ eggs. The man reached down and picked out the snowball indicated, as well as a big one from the top, and gave them to the boy, who breathed out a cry of wonder. At that moment, a camera clicked. “They’re real, Mom. They’re real snowballs.” “How much are those?” the mother asked. “On the house, ma’am, on the house.” “Oh, you are a gentleman.” “I’m sure you’ll do the same thing for my kid.” The woman, looking at the trader, reddened and was momentarily flustered. She wheeled the stroller around and began to walk away. But then she stopped and came back and stood gazing at the snowballs. The camera clicked again. “They are just the prettiest things, and the rows of them are just so funny. Made my day, sir. You made my day.” The trader nodded. Joe, seeing the interest around the snow stall, came over. “Ma’am, can I interest you in a new set of teeth?” But the transition from snowballs to false teeth was perhaps a little too bold for her, and she took off into the streets, looking back from time to time at the gleaming rows of snowballs on the patterned rug. Many people stopped, drawn by the mysterious and orderly form of the snowballs at the stall. Some came to banter, some came to test their wits, some came with cracks about capitalism. Another man saw the perfect rows of whiteness and couldn’t stop laughing. He meant to ask a question about how much they cost, but something about the setup seemed so hilarious to him that he just laughed and laughed and came close to choking. The trader had to come around the stall and pat him on the back ’til he calmed down and wiped the tears of laughter from his cracked, life-beaten face. When he laughed, he showed no upper teeth, and false-teeth man sold him a set at a knockdown price. The man was still laughing in the distance and saying something about always reinventing the dream, brother. Later, another man showed up. It seemed he was a lawyer from upstate and was in the big city for a conference. He had gone on a stroll and his feet had led him here; he took the snowball display very seriously and began haggling for the price of a middle-size ball. He was thinking of bringing it back home to his son, who he was sure would love it. Only he wanted to know if it would keep. “Put it in a fridge soon as you get back to your hotel. They’re packed pretty tight so they’ll hold for a while, so long as you’re not planning a trip to the Mojave Desert,” said the snow trader. The lawyer was very excited by this unusual purchase and took out his wallet. “I knew you guys were pretty wacky in the city, but this is the wackiest thing I’ve seen in a long time.” And all the while, the camera was clicking. No one really noticed the photographer, because he didn’t look the part. He blended in a short distance away and could be taken for a curious tourist, from the Middle East perhaps, someone overawed by the mesmerizing things the great city had to offer those with an eye for its quotidian oddities. The lawyer went off, chuckling to himself, with his wrapped-up snowball. He didn’t look back to see that the rows of whiteness on the resplendent rug had almost magically replenished themselves, so that they were again a perfect pattern of serial globes. Young women came by in their winter coats and their mufflers and their impeccable gloves. They couldn’t stop giggling at the cuteness of the row of small snowballs. They looked at the trader shyly, and he asked where they were from and engaged them mildly and carefully, tossing at them the occasional mot juste, or a throwaway line with a salty turn of wit, which they didn’t quite catch. They debated among themselves whether the snowballs would make a perfect birthday present for a friend and speculated about his reaction. While they pondered, someone else came by who was surprised to see the seller of snowballs and began to let out a cry of astonishment. The strange, severe look on the trader’s face stopped him in his playfully caustic greeting. “What’s up, brother?” “Just go away, or behave like you don’t know me,” whispered the snow seller in a fierce undertone. “Oh, all right, I get it,” said the newcomer, clearly an acquaintance. But he didn’t leave, sensing intrigue and a story, sensing that, with his usual good timing and excellent luck, he had stumbled on something, maybe a scoop, maybe just a good old tale to tell the folks. And so he lingered and examined the serial snowball display with the gravity of a connoisseur, dwelling on each detail. He asked the women, who were still debating, if they had a magnifying glass. They said they didn’t and, giggling again, wandered away. “This ain’t a museum,” the seller of snow said. “Move on, or I’m closing the stall.” The old friend stood up. “Okay, keep your stone hair on. I’ll push off, but that’s dinner you owe me.” “Call you next week.” “Can’t wait.” He left, walking in a lopsided way, as if he were conscious of being watched, which he was, by the snowball seller. The old friend made a backward gesture, a half wave, before disappearing round a corner. The snow seller called to Joe. “You got the time?” Joe shouted it across. “You thinking of packing up already?” “I’ll give it another half hour.” “Getting too hot for your snowballs?” Joe said, laughing and rubbing his palms together to warm them. “Sometimes the wrong people show up.” “Hazards of the trade, my man. The other day my ex-wife turned up. Offered to give her some of these here teeth instead of monthly maintenance. She didn’t want ’em.” “Can’t say I blame her.” “Put me right off my stride. Knocked the wind out of me, her turning up like that.” “Like you say, hazards of the trade.” “Ain’t that right.” A beautiful young woman arrived and stood in front of the snowball stall. With a solemn expression, she studied the glistening rows of snowballs. She seemed mesmerized, lost in a faraway musing. The depth of her absorption made her look even more beautiful. She stood there silently for a long time. The camera clicked discreetly. The seller of snowballs did not interrupt the young lady’s musings. With a half smile, he looked away and took his mind off her. Some things are just perfect if you let them be, he thought. Sometimes a moment is the ideal image of life. You couldn’t improve it if you had a thousand years. The camera worked unobtrusively. The seller of snowballs let his eyes wander over the city’s skyline. The rooftops were edged with snow. All of the boundaries were blurred. The snow linked things that seemed separate. It was falling now, flakes in pirouettes, bringing silence. It was time to make the show disappear. Our revels now are ended. The real magic begins when things disappear. It begins with erasure, with absence. The snowfall was obliterating the city, anonymizing its uniqueness. But the true enchantment is when from death things begin to return, long after people knew of their existence. You have to get people to know that something once happened, that it once existed, before you can make them know that it can never happen again, that it is lost in time forever. Lost in time, but resurrected in myth, or rumor, or stories. “Joe,” he said, “it’s been nice knowing you.” “You make it sound like a valediction.” “For a man who sells false teeth, you sure got one hell of a vocabulary.” The young lady smiled, and asked how much the snowballs cost, just as he began dismantling the show."

        "story": "Gene called them his good-day-bad-day bagels. When he was having a good day, he’d allow himself a bagel, and when he was having a bad day, he’d also allow himself a bagel. How he landed on bagels was a matter of both convenience and health: New York had no shortage of them and doughnuts upset his blood sugar. But bagels, on the other hand—they possessed an inoffensive, neutral quality. The problem was he sometimes swerved between good and bad so frequently that he ended up consuming three bagels before dinner. Though Gene believed in waiting until the end of the day before declaring it one or the other—sticking a nice, firm label beneath it—waiting defeated the purpose of an immediate, edible consequence. Gene measured out every moment of his life into a series of punishments and rewards. If he missed the subway right when the doors pinched shut, he let himself forgo eye contact with the homeless woman jiggling her paper cup. If he skipped the subway fare because a charitable stranger had propped the door open, his punishment (awful to consider it punishment, he knew) amounted to giving her a dollar along with the eye contact. Mentally taxing to approach life like a bank account, a nonstop escalator of fluctuating numbers, yet he found comfort in it. A system of measurements to keep himself on the straight moral path because he couldn’t always keep it straight in his mind—this was his self-prescribed treatment. Today, the day he took the N train from Astoria and boarded the bus on East 39th and Second, he’d tallied zero ups and two downs, meaning he was allowed two ups: an everything bagel with green-onion cream cheese (he counted them separately; he didn’t like to cheat the system). At the bodega, he’d considered ordering a second bagel, because today—surely, today of all days?—he would have reason to celebrate. He opened his brown paper bag as Napoleon sank into the seat beside him. “My doctor said I have the heart of a 60-year-old,” Napoleon said by way of hello. Given that Napoleon had turned 60 last month, Gene offered no response, instead politely listened as he denounced the toxicity of Western medicine. Napoleon interpreted Gene’s silence as a reproach. “What’s with you?” “Nothing,” Gene lied. “My stomach hurts.” Napoleon rummaged through his satchel, a fake Louis Vuitton, and produced a bottle of Po Chai pills. “Take two of these. With lukewarm—not cold—water.” Gene waved him away. “I’m fine.” “Suit yourself.” Napoleon zipped his satchel back up and eyed Gene’s paper bag. “What do you got there?” Gene reluctantly admitted to the everything bagel as Napoleon closed his eyes. “I haven’t eaten since last night. We wrapped at four in the morning. I took a nap on the 6, didn’t even have time to go home and shower—” Gene handed the bagel over. “You sure you don’t want any?” Napoleon said, already tearing through the wax paper. “I’m sure.” Gene meant to ask how bagels fit into Napoleon’s anti-Western cleanse, but was distracted by a familiar face boarding the bus—a woman he’d once been paired with as a couple at a fancy Szechuan restaurant in the Lower East Side. He turned in his seat and recognized more faces before the vertigo of familiarity was heightened by a new realization: Everyone present had been selected because, from a blurred distance, they could be related. Napoleon noticed too. “I bet you it’s a Japanese World War II movie.” Napoleon (his parents had named him with misguided hopes) played ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT while Gene played UPSCALE LAWYER. How their respective identities factored into this casting decision (Napoleon being a little more South to Gene’s East) was understood but left unspoken by both men. Standing in line to get propped—Gene with his shiny briefcase, Napoleon with a soiled cardboard sign—Napoleon had offered to lift Gene up. Napoleon’s shortcut to making friends was lifting people up, including the 6-foot-3 man who played SECURITY GUARD, somehow stunned and satisfied each time he managed it. Gene continued to run into Napoleon on set, not unusual when few background actors shared their narrow demographic. Without having exchanged numbers once, Gene suspected he was on more intimate terms with Napoleon’s catalog of health problems than Napoleon’s full-time friends were—one of the perks, or pits, of the job: endless hours to kill when the only weapon around was small talk. But the transitory nature of these interactions was also their beauty, which freed you up to confess more than you’d otherwise dare because after 12 consecutive hours together, you’d simply say, “Nice talking to you,” and never see each other again. You walked off with others’ confessions and they with yours, safe in the degrees of separation that stretched between you. Gene had been doing background for two years. When asked how he’d gotten into it (a stock question extras passed around between takes), he would say he’d always been interested in acting, and wasn’t a late start better than none? That wasn’t entirely true, though. Actually, it wasn’t true at all. He’d signed up to do background because of his daughter, Athena. Like Napoleon’s parents, Gene had named her with hopes she’d achieve magnificence, and then, to his bewilderment, she did: Winner of the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting. Nominated for Best Narrative Feature at SXSW.  Premiered at Sundance Film Festival. He once looked up her biography: “Athena Wu is a writer and director. The daughter of immigrants, her work interrogates the intersection of race, sex, and violence. She lives in Los Angeles.” “The daughter of immigrants.” He read the line twice to make sure he hadn’t hallucinated it. That she had taken on her mother’s maiden name was bad enough, but what had compelled her to lie? Like Athena, Gene had been born in Michigan; they’d moved to New York when she was 5. He’d grown up in an industrial town on the outskirts of Detroit, pretty painlessly, all things considered. He had plenty to be grateful for, all things considered. But Athena—she refused to acknowledge that her accomplishments, all the awards and fellowships and titles, had been made possible through an unbroken line of others’ suffering. And yet in her “body of work,” Athena never failed to adopt their suffering as her own. If such a thing as a surrogate of misery existed, that was his daughter. How to explain he was terrified of her? Not just terrified but puzzled he’d had any involvement in her upbringing, let alone her existence. In an interview, when asked why she’d gone into filmmaking, Athena had responded, “I’ve always been interested in controlling my environment. I guess you could say it was an affect developed in childhood.” The last line had made him squint sideways at his phone. Gene wasn’t an ambitious man himself—he looked for meaning in the hours spent clocked out of his job more than in the job itself, which was, at the moment, driving part-time for Uber. He and his cousin split custody of a slate-blue Toyota Camry; he had the weekends and his cousin, the weekdays. He rented out the second floor of a duplex from a young couple, a painful reminder he had yet to achieve the kind of financial security his daughter enjoyed. He led a noiseless life, though it was a little lonely and monotonous, true. But doing background, he’d been a NASA scientist, a doctor, and a UN ambassador without having to train for any of it. For as long as he could remember, Gene had had trouble staying loyal to a single objective. When Athena was younger, he’d been a security-desk attendant, a truck driver for a restaurant-supplies company, and a maintenance-crew member, just to name a few. In between jobs, he’d participated in paid surveys about products he could never afford and swallowed clinical-trial pills his nonexistent health insurance could never cover. He’d had no time to tend to a “career.” But Athena—she’d always known what she wanted. Barely in second grade and already arranging her toys in elaborate three-act stories. Other little girls wanted dolls or clothes; his daughter had coveted a Sony camcorder with infrared night vision. Other daughters were devoted to or at least tolerant of their fathers; his had abandoned him when he needed her the most. The bus squeaked onto 495 and spat them out in Long Island, at an immense studio Gene hadn’t known existed. All these years and New York kept pulling scarves out of its hat, discount-magician-style. He could never come to grips with the city, which thrived on chaos rather than order. But maybe that was why he stayed. The city was forgiving, built on second and third and fourth chances. In the parking lot, everyone stretched, yawned, and obediently shuffled in the direction of neon-pink signs pointing to holding—a demoralizing room with 10 fans in lieu of functioning AC. Nonunion’s breakfast was already waiting on warming trays: scrambled eggs, sausage patties, bacon, pancakes, and home fries. On an adjacent table were juice boxes and packaged snacks. The granola bars were always pocketed in seconds. Gene had forgotten this and by the time he wandered over, only unsalted peanuts greeted him. “Decent spread.” Gene looked up. Napoleon had sauntered in with his SAG-exclusive breakfast, served upstairs: eggs Benedict, shrimp cocktail, sliced avocado, and a salacious chocolate muffin. “Didn’t want to eat with them,” he sneered, though Gene didn’t understand why since he never let anyone forget he was SAG. “Where’s the line for SAG?” “Sorry to cut, I’m SAG.” “Is SAG getting bused home?” Another point docked off. Gene took a bite of flaccid pancake as the first AD swept into the room, his movements so frenetic that the NDAs fluttered in their piles on the conference tables. Gene waited for “Janek but you can call me Jack” to speak. He did not. To Gene’s amusement, Jack waited until all the NDAs were signed and collected before opening his mouth. From that moment on, the extras were bound to silence. “Okay, so _________ happens over the course of 24 hours. It’s made up of three vignettes, each one based around a different __________ in New York. I said vignette, not vinaigrette.” Most of the time, nobody on set bothered to explain anything to them. Most of the time, they were herded around like blind children. On the rare occasions explanations were offered, the film was either big-budget or art-house. “And our eyes and ears, __________, he’s the thread that connects them all. You still with me? Okay, so today we’re shooting three scenes.” Disappointment dribbled through the room. “I know, I know, it’s going to be a long day, but trust me, we want to get you out of here as fast as we can.” Translation: We don’t want to pay you a cent more than we have to. Someone raised her hand. Jack pretended not to see. “So in this vignette, everything takes place on a ______________. In the first scene, it’s a normal day. You’re all waiting for the _______ like it’s going to come any second. Yeah? In the next scene, it’s the same scenario but you’re getting a little __________ and you all ___ _____. In the last scene, imagine a _____ or __________ has just happened. This is when __________ starts to go haywire. He’s been ____________ throughout the day, ____ on, called a _______, and now he completely loses it. Got it?” Gene set down his fork, his appetite diminished. Why was Athena so seduced by tragedy? A chair screeched back against the linoleum floor. The elegant hand gripping it belonged to Hiriko, an attractive, widowed woman of undisclosed age. Gene had met her a couple of months back, when they played ND PEDESTRIANS during an alien invasion. She had a habit of bringing an enormous paperback to set, opening it up, then ignoring it for the rest of the shoot, and she kept a flask in her purse from which she stole small, satisfied sips. “Do you know who’s playing the lead?” she asked him, twinkling. Gene could never tell if she was flirting. He wasn’t even sure if he wanted her to flirt. He had not dated anyone in a very long time. “That young man everyone’s talking about, ______________.” He was said to be the next (the first?) great Asian American actor of their time, the one who’d raise them from obscurity into, well, something beyond obscurity. His résumé ran the gamut from superhero action flicks to romantic comedies, and now he was, unsurprisingly, segueing into dramas. And his daughter had nabbed him in her film’s lead role. His daughter—the words leaned forward on the edge of his tongue. He yanked them back. “He’s dating what’s-her-name, the actress who played the last Wonder Woman,” Hiriko added. Gene’s mind sketched a rough impression of her: blond, full-figured, legs up to here. “Isn’t that something.” The three chewed in silence. No one said aloud the obvious thought hanging over the table, That would have never happened in my day!, because it would have conceded the world was zipping in a different direction while they felt affixed to the same spot. The man at wardrobe took one look at Gene and asked if he’d brought a change of clothes. The question was an insult; his clothes were brand-name, from TJ Maxx. Gene did nearly all his shopping at TJ Maxx, a comfortingly neutral store. He shook his head no without bothering to trot out an excuse, then couldn’t help but cut his eyes at Napoleon and his fake Louis Vuitton luggage. Napoleon pulled out five full sets of options as wardrobe fawned over him. Inside a portable dressing room that refused to zip up all the way, Gene struggled to tug off his pants without knocking over the flimsy nylon contraption. He cursed himself for ignoring the wardrobe notes from last night. “No bright whites, no brand names, think grimy, interesting patterns acceptable, nothing that causes strobing, though!” Surely that warranted a subtraction of points. At hair and makeup, his hair was combed through and spritzed. Makeup devoted more time to covering him in soot-colored powder. “You have great eyebrows,” the makeup artist complimented him. She kissed her brush into a cake of gray and gently stabbed his forehead. Gene twisted up to look at her. She had purple hair, a flower tattoo trailing across her neck. “Thank you,” he said tremulously. He wished he knew her name. She looked a little put off by his sincerity. “Sure thing.” Add three points to the day. He had great eyebrows. She stepped away to let him review her work in the mirror: He looked poor. Poor and old. When the availability request had popped up on his phone, it had said only “BYSTANDER for UNNAMED PROJECT.” His eyes had snagged on the text. Something about it crackled, its very nondescriptness setting it apart from other requests. He had almost turned it down, had almost given up hope he’d ever land on one of his daughter’s sets, but then he remembered she was scheduled to be in New York. He’d read about it on a fan-run social-media account: “Athena Wu rumored to start production on her second feature in Manhattan next month.” He’d last seen her at the Atlantic City bus terminal, seven years ago. Their goodbye had been benign, even pleasant. When she handed him the envelope of cash, she hadn’t cut any of her usual backhanded or reproachful remarks. And when they parted, she’d even gripped his arm and said, “Good luck.” Good luck, in any language, spoke of well wishes, didn’t it? Not until weeks, then months, later—time marked by deafening silence to his calls, texts and emails—did he obsessively rewind and freeze-frame the moment. Trying hopelessly to pinpoint when in the course of an hour their relationship had soured and spoiled. When they stopped for Subway sandwiches? Waiting in line for tickets? But that was absurd. He wasn’t so naive as to believe the first thread had unraveled at the Atlantic City bus terminal. No, Athena must have decided sometime before (when?) to “estrange” herself from him. What a funny word, estrange! Gene thought it sounded unnecessarily fancy, almost French, since it called to mind escargots. But sitting smack in the middle of the word was strange, and yes, strange was the word for a part of yourself going off into the world, scaling magnificent heights, while the other part remained a distant spectator. If Gene had to describe the sensation, he’d say it was like catching a glimpse of your elbow on someone else’s arm and wondering, Now how did you end up there? The PA charged with wrangling them like blind children was Beckett. He wore the standard PA uniform: sneakers, jeans, hoodie, and a holster slung around his hips where a walkie talkie took the place of a gun. Gene felt paternal toward the PAs, who were invariably in their 20s and considered sleep a fun activity they’d try someday. When an unusually thoughtful PA asked, “Need anything? Everything okay? Let me know if you want water,” Gene had to stop himself from asking, “Do you need anything? Is everything okay with you? Let me know if you want water.” Beckett, unlucky fellow, was not a PA with a natural loudspeaker built into his lungs. Gene caught the beginning half of his sentence as he crossed the room, his voicing cracking in the middle: “If you have not had your picture taken—” “What?” Hiriko called. “What was that?” The question went unanswered and they were transferred into the care of another overworked PA. Tian formed the start of a line, looking serenely unbothered. Of all the people Gene had ever met on set, Tian had been doing background the longest. He never scrolled through his phone between takes or tried to negotiate sitting down in a scene. He’d never dream of sneaking off to holding, pretending he hadn’t heard his number called. In other words, he was the consummate extra. The PA asked for their numbers. “Two,” Tian chimed in his clear voice. Of course he was No. 2 on the call sheet. Hiriko turned to Napoleon. “How are auditions?” Unlike her and Gene, Napoleon was an acteur, meaning he had an agent who occasionally secured him auditions in demoralizing rooms not unlike holding. “I just did one for a commercial,” he said, loud enough for others to hear. “A national one.” Gene and Hiriko exchanged Aren’t we special? glances. “For gastritis, which, sure, isn’t what I planned on for my acting debut, but I wouldn’t have to work for a year: $50,000 on average is what I’m hearing. And don’t forget the residuals.” If Napoleon lucked out, he’d be guaranteed a lifelong job. Then again, he’d be forever known as the face of gastritis. Which put him out of the running for arthritis guy, ulcers guy, etc. They shuffled back to their table. “I hope you get it, Napoleon, I really do.” Gene mostly meant it. He pulled out the bag of peanuts, scrutinized it. Did he deserve a reward? “You’re just—what—one voucher away from joining SAG?” Napoleon asked, though he’d asked Gene this question before. Another point docked. “Mm-hmm.” Hiriko’s eyeglasses slipped down her nose as she leaned forward. “You have to learn a special skill. Sign language. Playing dead. Tap dancing. You know, I once danced with Sessue Hayakawa.” She winked at Gene as he struggled to recalculate her age based on this new bit of information. He wasn’t imagining it—she was flirting. She opened her paperback and scanned Gene’s midsection. “Or just invest in an NYPD costume. You have the build.” Maybe not. “You know what you got to do?” Napoleon teased. “Insert yourself.” A few legendary extras had snatched up speaking roles by shouting a line so good, so flawless, they’d rendered themselves indispensable. Infamous among extra lore was the Being John Malkovich scene when a guy whips a beer can at John and hollers, “Think fast!” Hiriko pursed her lips. “What do you mean?” Gene recounted the anecdote, pleased as anything, as if it belonged to him and only him. “Oh, that? That’s been debunked.” Hiriko sipped gaily from her flask. “You didn’t know?” Gene sighed with inordinate disappointment. Now why did she have to tell him that? He preferred the false version, the better version. By noon, Beckett’s voice had been reduced to a rasp. “Everyone, Nos. 1 to 75, follow me. We are going to set now. Leave your stuff here. No one will steal your umbrella, I promise. Yes, go to the bathroom now. Bring your IDs to get propped. I said, ‘BRING YOUR IDs.’” Beckett led them through a tunnel of hallways leading into a massive warehouse. Rows of horizontal lights spanned the length of the walls, tricking the eye into the collective fiction that broad daylight filled the warehouse. Extraordinary, the amount of muscle and sweat poured into movie magic, Gene thought. And he did think it was extraordinary, to the point where he’d look around set and grow a little misty-eyed. I’m a part of movie magic, he’d reflect, and if I so much as step in the wrong direction, I can break the spell. They passed by a construction area—sawing, hammering, sanding—before entering a replica of a New York City subway station. The uncanniness was surreal: Everything, down to the grimy tiles and dripping metal beams and balled-up, wet trash, had been cloned to perfection. The set was frantic with people wrangling their respective gear: cameras, lighting, sound, hair and makeup, the person who stuck neon tape on the ground (how was he named in the credits? Gene had always wondered). He spotted Jack yapping into his headset, a different PA reprimanding Beckett, Napoleon hitting on a guy half his age, and then, and then—he saw her. She was staring at a screen, seated in a raised folding chair. Her hair was short now, chin-length, not long as she’d always worn it. She looked tired. She looked awfully young compared with everyone around her. She was dressed like a PA. Did she need water? He could have cried. “You.” Beckett snapped his fingers. “Here.” He pointed to a spot a few yards away from Athena. Her outline flitted in the corner of Gene’s eye. Napoleon nudged him. “What are you doing?” Gene realized everyone was grudgingly lying down. “Which scene is this?” “How the hell would I know? They never tell us shit.” “If wardrobe says I ruined this coat, it’s not my problem,” Hiriko murmured. She took off her glasses, then looked at Gene for approval. He offered up a noncommittal noise. As soon as Athena was preoccupied, Gene carefully lowered himself down; he couldn’t bear for her to catch him panting and fumbling, the spitting image of the old man he must have occupied in her imagination. He stared up at the enormous ceiling. The floor beneath him was cold. The stand-in for the principal actor was shuttled off as Jack’s voice descended from above. “Okay, so this is before __________ has entered the station. Think of it as the ____ before the _______. Right now we want to create a _________ mood. Got it?” He was met with blank faces. “Lie still, but move around. Scratch something, cough—no, mime coughing—just don’t look dead. Okay?” Jack clapped his hands together. Gene struggled to make sense of the film. Was it abstract? Athena’s first film had been abstract (an excess of neon signs at night; decadent food left uneaten on tables; opaque conversations) but at the same time the very opposite of abstract, given that 10 minutes of it were devoted to the gang rape of a girl. A girl who looked not unlike his daughter. Gene’s instinct was to flee the theater mid-film, and he might have if his body hadn’t congealed into a useless block of flesh. Afterward, he used the lobby’s free Wi-Fi to scrape the internet for information on how he was supposed to feel. However illogical, he couldn’t help but suspect Athena left signs for him in her art. If she’d baked a message into this first film, what on earth was it? In an interview, when asked about the film’s explicit violence, Athena had answered, “I had to show the truth. This happened. We can’t look away from it,” referencing a 1985 news story out of San Francisco’s Chinatown. Gene understood this; he did. At least on an intellectual level. But who was it for? Who wanted to watch it? He certainly didn’t want to see five white men gang-rape a girl who looked not unlike his daughter. He could’ve lived his whole life without seeing it. Happily. But maybe he was a Philistine. He favored comedies. Animated movies. Black-and-white classics. He was a sucker for unambiguous endings. In the lobby, he’d put away his phone with an uneasy heart. Whenever he watched interviews of his daughter, she came across as angry. Angry and self-righteous. The combination made him profoundly sad. Wasn’t she tired? He wanted to tell her to take a break. To allow herself carefree stupidity, the birthright of anyone her age. But his daughter was on a crusade (against what?). She was terrifying. She’d always terrified him. “Napoleon?” Gene whispered. “Yeah?” Napoleon’s head was positioned just above his. Tiger Balm wafted from his forehead; the man was morphing into an apothecary. “I ever tell you I have a daughter?” “QUIET ON SET.” The urge to toss it all out the window seized Gene. To throw a beer can and yell, “Think fast!” Gene licked his chapped lips. “She’s the director.” Napoleon twisted around in disbelief as someone barked, “Stay in your first positions.” “No kidding?” He fished for the miniature headshots he kept in his wallet. “Hey, introduce me.” Gene swatted his hand away. “She doesn’t know I’m here.” “What the hell are you talking about, Gene?” Napoleon demanded, abruptly a full Staten Islander, a fact he suppressed until he couldn’t. “HOLD THE TALK. LAST LOOKS.” Napoleon brushed his hair back and sucked in his cheeks. “Pictures up … Rolling … Background … Action!” Everyone shushed. Action! was the sacred word that recontextualized the set into a nearly religious space. Every second carried weight and they all bore it, each and every one of them, for a common purpose, and surely such collective devotion gestured at a kind of religion, didn’t it? Gene noticed only then that the principal actor had materialized. Gene startled a little in recognition—so Hiriko had been right. The principal actor fell to the ground, moaning and writhing, before crawling over the extras. His foot nearly grazed Gene’s chin. After a while, his wails echoed through the set. In Gene’s opinion, he was overdoing it, his drama sliding toward melodrama. “Cut!” Athena’s voice. Gene’s heart did a jumping jack. “RESETTING.” For the next two hours, while the camera was moved into every conceivable position, Gene remained suspended in a state of anxiety so intense it bordered on elation. When Jack called, “Checking the gate!” his posture caved with relief. Beckett allowed the extras to stop by the crafty truck before heading back to holding. Gene stretched and dawdled, loitering until the others had filed off set. He felt oddly light and heavy at once. He steadied himself and walked toward Athena, the calm center in a cluster of moving bodies, her headphones hanging off one ear, still staring intently at a screen monitor. Gene kept his eyes down as he passed, but at the last minute he looked up and what do you know, she was looking right at him. “Dad?” she said, not unkindly, not even so much in surprise. “Athena!” She continued to stare at him. Then she got up and hissed, “Follow me.” From the back, she looked very thin—malnourished, practically. Her walk still listed toward the left, a flaw inherited from her mother. She led him behind the set, lights blaring synthetic daylight above them, over electrical cords and past carts stacked with bottled water, through a set of double doors into the parking lot. Outside, it was drizzling. Gene’s hands trembled; he was on the verge of splitting apart from happiness. He’d planned out this moment hundreds of times. The apologies. The forgiveness. The reunification, like two weary countries after a civil war. “You’re sick,” she said. “I’ve missed you.” “What are you doing here?” “I’m acting,” he smiled. She smiled back like she wanted to run him over with a car. “I could have you arrested.” “No, you can’t,” he said lightly, and even she looked struck by this truth. “Please leave.” “You look great, Athena.” “You have no right—” “I have every right.” His voice had lost its friendly edge. At this, Athena laughed unconvincingly. The skin around her eyes had already started to sag. She’s only 27, he thought. “I have no obligation to you,” she said. “I disagree.” “Your opinion doesn’t matter here.” “‘Opinion?’” he repeated skeptically. “Who’s talking about opinions? You’re my daughter—” “Stop.” The hardness etched into the word was so startling, he took a step backwards. “I will not engage with you on your terms. You will not cross the boundaries I’ve put up to safeguard my well-being.” She had switched to the clipped, even register of a therapist. If she would at least scream, if she would at least cry! Anything would have been preferable to this phony wall of talk therapy. And yet he sensed the wall she’d patched together was fragile, the thinnest of paper holding back a flood. If he just pressed a little further— “I’ll leave you alone if you give me a legitimate reason why,” Gene countered. He was convinced he’d engineered an indisputable workaround, because the contrary, leaving her alone for good, was unbearable. Instead, he stood dumbstruck as Athena fired terms at him like emotional abuse and parental neglect. As proof, she brought up the money, though she’d assured him in Atlantic City that she wanted to—what was it?—put him on the road to recovery. She told him she’d been going to Al-Anon for two years after realizing none of it was her fault. Gene frowned. Al-Anon? She’d always blamed herself, did he know that? As a child, she had to do everything, she had to track his purchases, his whereabouts, cover up his blunders for the sake of her mother, throw out the empty bottles, open the windows in the morning to air out the stink. Keeping their family from collapsing in on itself had fallen to her, but if she so much as asked for a packed lunch, she feared she was acting selfishly. She existed on perpetual tiptoe, afraid the slightest misstep would set him off, unable to go to bed for hours because she was waiting, she was always waiting. And yet at school, she had to pretend she had normal kid problems, make up excuses for why she fell asleep during class or why Gene had missed another parent-teacher conference. Thanks to Al-Anon, she had finally started to heal. Heal. The word alone was a condemnation. A younger version of himself might have shouted or slammed an object against a table to tug the narrative back toward reason. But this version of himself—tired, lonely, and tired of feeling lonely—could only grab a handful of empty words. “I see.” He couldn’t even bring himself to say sorry. He loathed himself for it. But apologizing would admit to her version of the truth. When Gene didn’t say more, Athena blinked in surprise. “Well—yes. And I need you to respect that.” She turned and walked toward the doors. Gene called out, “I wanted to say I’m happy for you.” The trembling in happy sickened him. He’d tried so hard to sound cheerful. Athena slowed her steps without stopping. He started subtracting points, then lost count. A year before they parted at the Atlantic City bus terminal, she’d been the same at her mother’s funeral. Withholding. Cold. Distant. Gene knew parents could be withholding, cold, distant. He didn’t know children could be too. Athena made all the funeral arrangements, and for that, Gene was grateful. Well, more accurately, he felt blips of gratitude, bright buoys in the sea waving to him from afar through a haze of near-constant inebriation. From the hospital to the church, he was awash, afloat on a mixture he’d concocted of suanmeitang and whiskey, while Athena rushed around making calls, answering the door, heating up leftovers. He was inconsolable. He would have liked to drown. He couldn’t think of Bi-Ling’s wasted body sans thinking with morbid jealousy of the pain-free place she now inhabited. The few times clarity visited before a numbing headache took their place, he’d wonder, Why aren’t you inconsolable? My busy daughter. My oh-so-efficient daughter. Why have you left me flailing alone in this watery grief? “Hi, yes, one black coffee, cheese crackers, a Rice Krispies treat, and … Sorry, what do you have back there?” He sensed the line behind him twitching with impatience. “And a granola bar. Wait, never mind—a fruit cup,” he said sagely. He hated fruit cups. The points demanded a punishment. Or a reward. He no longer knew. Gene had conceived of the good-day-bad-day-bagel system after attending his first, and only, AA meeting. First and only because he just couldn’t look himself squarely in the eye in the light of day. If he looked at a problem aslant, it didn’t fully exist and therefore it couldn’t fully dominate his reality. Cowardly, he knew. But in his own way, he had managed. Hadn’t he? “So you don’t want the other stuff?” The cook’s face didn’t sugarcoat his exasperation. “No, I do,” he sighed. Arms full, coffee sloshing onto his borrowed shoes, Gene walked back to holding and sat down. Athena’s words nagged at him. “‘Impact over intent.’ What does that mean, anyway?” Napoleon shrugged as Hiriko turned thoughtful, flipping the pages of her book without glancing at them. “Do you have an example?” she asked. “That’s what I’m saying—it doesn’t have any meaning. You can’t disagree with it. Like an ace card.” Gene stared suspiciously at his empty fruit cup—when had he eaten it? “Are you okay, buddy?” Napoleon asked with unusual sympathy. As if Gene were unwell. Or worse, senile. “Did you … talk to her?” Before Gene could answer, Beckett called them back to set. As they filed down the hallway, Hiriko held out her flask. Just by its heft in his palm, Gene knew it was half full—funny how an old instinct kicked right back in as if it had never left. He hesitated for a second, then cleared it in a single gulp. He had pinned Hiriko for a sherry drinker, but it was straight gin. She raised an eyebrow. “One of those days?” What Gene could not abide was being smudged away. That’s how Athena looked at him—like a smudge on the plain of her pristine life. A relic of her pre-famous past she’d never have to set eyes on again simply because she could choose not to, so low was he beneath her line of sight. Unbelievable that she’d denied the fact of their biological relationship. Of course, she’d packaged it in different terms: chosen family and personal autonomy. Nonsense was what it was. But Athena had always rewritten reality to match her preferences. Though her mother had died from a sickness hoarded in her genes—the Huntington’s so engulfing, it swallowed her personality—Athena claimed the disease had been triggered by Gene. The last night they spent at the hospital, she launched accusation after accusation at him: that Bi-Ling had abandoned her family and friends in Taiwan to move 8,000 miles for him based on promises he never intended to keep. That she’d lived a miserable and isolated life in this foreign country. That Gene, as self-centered and responsible as a teenager, couldn’t see it. After Atlantic City, Gene had decided to start fresh, to become someone … fresher. He was a good man. Not a perfect man, no. He’d had a temper when he was younger, he could admit to that. And the drinking hadn’t helped (harder to admit). But he found it laughable that some people believed an instance of human error could negate, could indeed cancel out, love. His own father used to beat him, even when Gene was old enough to fight him off. And yet he’d forgiven him, in the sense that he had not known his father’s fist needed forgiving. He’d been five years sober—until now, anyway. He’d forgotten to tell Athena in the parking lot. He’d wanted so badly to pocket her pride in him, to be able to gaze upon it anytime he wanted. He waited for something akin to momentous sorrow to wash over him, his hard-won sobriety erased in a blink, and yet the reality of what that sip portended seemed very far away. Points lost, points gained. He decided he would not think about it anymore and that was that; Gene had always been good at compartmentalizing. He studied his aching legs instead. He should have worn his compression socks. Or maybe the feeling was heartburn. Where was Napoleon with his Po Chai pills when you needed him? They were shooting the last scene of the day. Two hours ago, they’d wrapped the third (or was it the first?) scene and passed into overtime, which meant a tidy $24.75 per hour, but what would Gene have given to just go home already. It was a mistake to have come. A mistake to assume knowing could ever substitute the softness, the loveliness, of not knowing. Jack was bouncing up and down, somehow even more energetic than at the start of the day. Gene would bet money he’d been subsisting on a steady dose of Adderall. “So in this scene, you’re all exhausted, okay?” Napoleon snorted. “But this is the big moment we’ve been building up to, when __________ is finally going to ________. Remember he’s been _____ on, _________, ______ around, and he’s had it up to here. It’s an emotional scene, a highly charged scene, and I want you all to feel it.” The extras were to stumble haphazardly around the subway station—easy when everyone was floating in a fugue state at this 12th hour. Jack moved them into their first positions. “Don’t be afraid to run into each other—I mean, don’t hurt yourself,” he quickly amended, no doubt thinking of lawsuits, “but act like you can’t see where you’re going. Okay?” “If I ruin this coat, it won’t be my fault,” Hiriko murmured again. She looked at Gene for affirmation. He was in no mood to give it this time. Commotion was developing farther up along the set, where the stand-ins and stunt coordinator were situated, but came to a pause when the principal actor emerged. His hair and makeup team trailed behind him, spraying and smoothing and powdering, as he carefully avoided eye contact with the background actors, then checked his phone before sliding it into his pocket. Unbelievable, Gene scoffed. Athena conferred with the principal actor and the stunt coordinator, the three of them speaking in agitated tones. Then the stunt coordinator called “No. 2,” and Tian walked over to join them. Gene kept his eyes on Athena, willing her to look his way. She refused. After a few minutes, Tian returned to his first position. “Pictures up … Rolling … Background … Action!” Gene zigzagged across the set, half blind without needing to act. The gin coursed agreeably through him. He slammed his shoulder into several people, Napoleon included, who doled out a sorrowful look in his direction. He walked at a faster pace, everyone’s faces smearing together, then slowed his steps when he heard the principal actor’s voice. He zigzagged toward it. The principal actor gripped Tian by the collar, then sneered a slur in his face and pushed him. He mimed kicking Tian for an excruciatingly long time. Gene looked at Hiriko—she had broken protocol and closed her eyes. The sudden violence in the scene, in the warehouse, came as a terrible intrusion. Nothing, not even Jack’s frenetic explanations, could have prepared them for it. “Still rolling!” the second AD called. A PA rushed up to the principal actor with an unlabeled bottle and squirted milky liquid into his mouth. He leaned back, about to spit in Tian’s face. Gene’s stomach clutched. “Stop,” Tian said flatly. “I can’t.” A few extras stalled in their movements, unsure if this was his line, if he’d been anointed out of the background masses at long last to a speaking role. “Cut!” Athena called. She got down from her chair and walked over. “What do you mean you can’t?” she said with a hint of annoyance. “You just agreed to a second ago.” Her hands flowered open and closed, open and closed—a nervous habit. “I don’t understand why we’re hurting each other,” Tian frowned. “It doesn’t make sense.” Behind Gene, two PAs were whispering. “—thought a _____ actor was too ‘controversial’ and a _____ actor was too ‘predictable.’” The other PA whistled under his breath. “Apparently, she said the ‘safest choice’ was an all _____ cast.” Gene couldn’t help but grimace—his daughter’s vision of society was awfully reductive. But for whatever reason, she must have derived comfort from reducing it down to manageable parts. Was it so different from his good-day-bad-day-bagel system? “I want to call my SAG rep,” Tian continued. Not the consummate extra, after all. The principal actor vainly suppressed an eye roll. Another extra addressed Athena. “What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?” “Abuse against _____ is on the rise and—” “And your solution is more abuse?” “But it’s not real,” Athena said softly, as though to herself. Tian laughed. “Am I not real?” The question ricocheted through the crowd of extras. For a shameful, fleeting moment, Gene thought of calling out, “Impact over intention, Athena! Isn’t that what you said?” She was no doubt wearing the same contemptuous mask she’d worn in the parking lot, but when he looked in her direction, her expression spelled horror. Authority leaked out of her by the second. She looked so small. She looked so young. In elementary school, Athena used to film him and Bi-Ling with a cardboard camera constructed from toilet-paper rolls. He’d crushed it in his hands one night, hostile and drunk and then hostile because he was drunk, but the next day, he’d bought her a used Sony camcorder with that week’s paycheck, which meant he’d have to skip meals twice a day, but she’d thrown her arms around his waist and it had been worth every spasm of hunger. When she’d asked him in her little-adult voice (terrifying, she’d been, even then) if they had enough money to afford the camera, he’d lied. “Whatever you want, I’ll get it for you” was his favorite refrain, even when Bi-Ling scolded him for turning her into a bottomless person, someone whose desires have no end. He never told Athena about the illegal gambling that had paid off her mother’s hospital bills. About the months he spent processing fake IDs in Jackson Heights as a second source of income. About how, during her freshman year of college, after his bike was stolen and he lost his job as a deliveryman, he’d spent six dehumanizing weeks homeless. She believed what she wanted to believe. No, she believed what he’d let her believe. Maybe both were true. He realized with sudden, achingly sweet clarity what Athena had meant in her interview. Directing brought her control over her environment because it offset the chaos he brought to it. When she zoomed in and out on her camera, perhaps she left their apartment in Astoria. Perhaps she traveled somewhere else entirely—to a safer, better place. “I’ll do it.” Gene walked into the heart of the commotion. “What are you doing, buddy?” Napoleon asked, resting a hand on his sleeve. He shrugged him off. Tian looked at Gene, shook his head slightly, then walked off set. Gene half-expected people to clap. No one did. Gene stepped in front of the principal actor. Up close, his handsomeness seemed unearned. “You don’t have to, Dad.” Athena spoke quietly. Everyone stared at her. The attempt to stop him only emboldened Gene. He sat down on the ground. Strangely, it wasn’t as cold as before. “Kick me,” he said to the principal actor. “Go ahead, spit on me.” He had done the math. This is what the points commanded. The crew looked around at one another. After a moment, the sound guy re-hoisted the boom. The lighting team repositioned themselves. Athena walked back to her director’s chair. Gene lay prostrate before his part-time friends, the other extras, the crew, and, though he could not see her, his daughter, who watched him from behind the camera’s unblinking eye. Gene qualified to join SAG that day. On IMDb, he is credited as ELDERLY ASIAN MAN. A gift from his daughter; according to union laws, his silent role did not require screen credit. After the film’s release, he read review after review, hoping to reach a verdict on his daughter’s work without experiencing it, but the reviews were as mixed as he felt. When he finally purchased a ticket at his local theater early one morning, he was one of three in the audience. He thought he’d feel detached, looking at himself pretending to be someone else, knowing exactly what tricks had been turned to tamper with the fake until it could pass as real. But as Gene watched himself gasping and convulsing on the subway platform—his arms tucked helplessly around his stomach, his mouth limp with resignation—he felt knocked over by such exquisite grief and, to his surprise, discovered his cheeks were wet."

        "story": "We’re gathered around Victor’s body. I can’t look at his face and don’t want to look down like the others. Find myself staring at the glass of water on the counter. The nervous little ripples. This is why I know the hum is there, although I can’t hear it. None of us has ever heard the hum, because we were born into it. But the surface of the water, a crumb dancing on the table, or, sometimes, my face trembling in the mirror reminds me of it. Even if I plug my ears or listen to music, the hum is in my body. From the floor and the walls to my skin and my bones. So I look at the rippling water and think that with Victor, we’ve lost silence. It was only in his head, of course. A memory. But now we don’t even have that. Now there’s only the hum. When all lights are out, darkness is total and loneliness absolute. An infinite cage. That’s why they’re seldom turned off. And that’s why we all giggled with relief when Victor came in, holding the cake in one hand and a small flashlight in the other. It was pointed at the ceiling, like a candle. Everyone started to sing. As Victor walked toward me, the light under his chin magnified different parts of his face with each step. The blood vessels glowing in his nostrils. The confusion of his white beard. During the last “happy,” the entire cavern of his mouth was lit. One of his molars was blue. Who knows what he’d recast to make it. I closed my eyes, made a wish, and blew on the flashlight, which Victor switched off just in time. They all cheered. The lights were immediately turned back on. “What did you wish for?” Fei asked. “To see real fire one day.” This made everybody uncomfortable for a second. “That’s beautiful,” Victor whispered in my ear. Of course, that wasn’t my real wish. I felt bad lying to Victor, but everyone knows that wishes won’t come true if you say them out loud. Nan gave me a new game she’d made especially for me. In it, I was a centaur and had to explore a valley looking for data and things that’d allow me to become either a human or a horse. The graphics were amazing. Lu’s gift was to take over my full cleaning shift whenever I chose. Nefti promised to repair the loose wall paneling behind my bunk. Fei had made me a much-needed new shirt, and Victor gave me a book. My first actual book. He’d printed it, cut the pages to the right size, and bound it between cardboard covers. I could tell the others thought it was wasteful. “You have to read Amanda Gibbons on the page. At least once,” he told me. And then, to the others, “She can recycle it when she’s done.” “I’ll never recycle it,” I said, leafing through the book and then putting my nose into it. “Incredible,” Victor said. “That’s exactly what many of us used to do. How did you know to smell the book?” “How could you not?” Don’t know what I was expecting, but it had no smell at all. Then we all had cake. Except for Sam, who’d just been reclicked. She had that face, shut against the stench that hits you when you come back. And sort of looking inward, figuring it all out again. I couldn’t fall asleep after the party. Above me, in her bunk, Lu kept turning. The loose wall panel made noise every time she moved. That’s not what kept me awake, though. Thirteen years old. The real work began now, they said. But I’d also have more freedom. I’d be attending all the meetings. Thirteen. Something about the number itself, and not just because of the whole “teen” thing. There was a hardness, a seriousness to it that I couldn’t explain but could only feel. The youngest here but no longer a child, as everyone kept reminding me. Tried to read my book but couldn’t focus. Kept turning it in my hands, flipping through the pages. Thirteen. I opened Nan’s game. There I was, half human, half horse. Our bodies blended perfectly. Why did I have to choose? I trotted around a forest, thinking about Victor. He looked worried. Old. He was old. After me came Nan (15) then Lu (17) then Fei (19) then Sam (22) then Dit (25) then Delia (28?) then Nefti (31?) then Bibi (33?) then Robin (37). Then Victor (68). Lu kept turning. And across the aisle, Delia started snoring. I galloped through a meadow, toward a waterfall. The following morning Nan, Lu, and I had class. The lessons kept getting shorter. Bibi seemed to have given up. Didn’t really teach anymore—barely made sure we were reading instead of playing games. Lessons used to be so much fun. Especially history. We’d argue about the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Cortés and Montezuma, the Beijing campaign, the Canadian War. But something had changed. Now we just sat there. Nan and Lu often got away with playing games. Out of the blue, they’d have sudden laughing fits together. Bibi didn’t care. Seemed gone. Truth is we were all too old for school. After class, on my way to the bridge, I saw Sam. She was looking out, her forehead resting on the glass. Perhaps I upset the air as I approached her. She retched. “You should drink a lot of water,” I said. “Really helps.” “It smells here. I smell.” “You’ll get used to it. They told you that, right?” She turned toward me. “Have you ever been reclicked?” she asked. Her voice was raspy. It was probably her first time talking after the procedure. “Many times.” “Is it always like this?” “Always. But you’ll feel better by tomorrow. And then you should enjoy the novelty of it all, while it lasts.” “I don’t understand. I remember everyone here. Remember you. But can’t say exactly from where. Or who you are, really.” She coughed. “And I remember myself. My name. My face. But not where I come from. And can’t remember this place. Just went to the kitchen. Had never been there. But knew exactly where the plates and cups were.” “You’re meant to forget most things about this place, but not who you are. They told you that, right? And it’s not perfect, what’s left in or out.” “Have I been reclicked before?” “Many times.” Her eyes demanded more. “Every two years or so,” I said. “Depends.” “On what?” “How stir-crazy we’re going. Nobody’s made it for more than five years.” “Was I born here?” “We all were. Except for Victor. He’s the last from the previous generation.” “Who are my parents?” Had no one given Sam the tutorial after reclicking her? “We come from the nursery. If it makes you feel better, I also come from the nursery. We all do. Except for Victor.” “I’m 22 years old.” I waited to see what she’d say next. But that was it. She put her forehead back on the glass. “Come with me to the bridge. The view is even better from there. And it’ll be like the first time for you.” “Nice shirt,” Victor said when he met me at the nursery a little later. “Fei is the best. Sorry I haven’t started reading the book yet.” “Ah, you have to find the right time.” The work at the nursery is boring but requires full attention. No room for mistakes. That’s why people work in pairs. To check on each other. I was assigned my first shift there the day after my birthday. A rite of passage, everyone called it at the party. I’d work with Victor, who’d teach me all about the place. “The code changes every week,” he said as he punched in a number and opened the door. “We want to make sure only the two people in charge get in. Here, want to set the new code?” I put in four digits. “French Revolution?” Victor chuckled. “Love it.” We went in. I’d visited the nursery countless times before. It’s the only place on board that’s spotless and new. Nothing’s ever taken away from there to be recycled or repurposed. Perhaps I wouldn’t notice how run-down the rest of the place is if it weren’t for how pristine the nursery looks. Still, I’d always found the long rows of drawers and cabinets unremarkable, despite knowing what was in them. But now it was different. The sense of responsibility was breathtaking. Almost suffocating. “Multitudes,” I said. “Hey, that’s my line!” Victor said, jokingly bumping into my shoulder. True. It was his line. Whenever we visited the nursery, usually with Bibi for some school assignment, Victor would point to the middle section and say, “These drawers contain multitudes. These are our descendants.” And then, gesturing to different cabinets, he’d continue, “And here’s every tree and every bird. Over there, every flower and every bee. And there, every fish and the fish it’ll feed and the fish it’ll feed.” And so on. A bit in jest but also serious. “All right, let’s get to work,” Victor said. “I know this is weird, but I must ask you to recite the protocols into the camera. For the record. Everyone has to do it on their first day. And we all have to do it after being reclicked. We need to make sure people understand and remember the importance of this task and know every step when they begin.” I looked up at the camera in the corner where two walls met the ceiling and recited the passage I’d spent days memorizing: “The nursery is the core of this ship and its mission. The nursery is life itself: the most extensive collection of flora and fauna, including humans in their widest genetic diversity. To preserve this core is the crew’s main duty. No other task or circumstance may ever come before this one central mission: ensuring that the seeds in this ship be sown in new ground.” After this, I quoted the description of each of the 21 protocols, including vitals, inspection of the gestation chambers, power and safety controls, all six backup checks, and evacuation and rescue procedures. “Flawless,” Victor said. “Now let’s actually make sure everything’s okay.” We went through every screen on every drawer, testing the systems and reading the numbers out loud to each other—and for the camera. Halfway into this mind-numbing process, I asked for a break. “Nope. Can’t waste their time,” Victor said, waving at the camera. “In fact, in a couple of weeks it’ll be your turn to be on the other side, supervising the next pair as they read the numbers. Isn’t it fun to finally be a grown-up?” Nan, Lu, and Fei were by the recycling chute talking in excited whispers but stopped when they saw me come over with my chair and a bag full of cutlery. They weren’t that much older, but they treated me like a baby. For a short time, the four of us were close friends. But as they got older, one by one they left the kids’ group. In the end, it was just Nan and me. Then she also joined the others and never spoke to me the same way again. Nefti had told me we needed a new aluminum part for one of the generators. We’d be recasting half our cutlery. And they’d asked me to hand over my chair. Things seemed to be breaking more than ever. We constantly had to recycle all sorts of materials to make all kinds of parts. I knew the grown-ups had always been taking one thing from one place, breaking down its materials, recasting them into something else, and then recycling that again once they were done, sometimes turning it back into its original form. “What we have is what we have.” We’d been repeating this ever since I could remember. We kept reusing the stuff on board, which explained why the whole place looked so shabby and the passageways were always cluttered with half-dismantled gear. Of course I’d noticed it before, but I guess I only really got it now that it affected me. They’d never taken away my stuff when I was a kid. I put the chair down by the chute. “We’ll make you a new one as soon as we have some spare material to recast,” Fei said. I shrugged. I liked not being babied anymore. Having fewer things, like the others. Not caring. “How are you holding up?” asked Nan, concerned. Unsure of what she meant, I smiled. “We were watching you on the monitors when you were at the nursery,” Lu said. “Good job.” “Really great,” said Nan. “I hear you’re getting your badge today. How does it feel to finally be part of the crew?” I hated their condescension. “Listen,” Fei cut in, creating a heavy pause. “Just wanted to say … So sorry about Victor. I know how close you guys are.” “What do you mean?” I asked. The three of them exchanged glances. “Oh … Just that … Now that you’re a full crew member, you’ll be much busier, and both of you probably won’t be able to spend so much time together.” Like an idiot, I said Victor and I were working together and we’d still be close. Since it was my first crew meeting, they let me sit in the command chair. I felt embarrassed and would have preferred to stand or sit on the floor, like the others. Robin and Nefti did most of the talking. They welcomed me to the crew. Gave me that badge I’d always wanted and that nobody ever wears. I immediately knew I wouldn’t wear it either. A short speech about honor and responsibility. Then they said the time had come for me to learn about the true nature of our trip. Everyone looked down. Best to be direct, they said. None of us would ever make it to our destination. The trip was simply too long. Just as we’d been born on the ship, we’d die on the ship. But our descendants would make it. This had always been the plan, since the first generation left Earth. And just as we’d gradually replaced them over the years, we in turn would be replaced by the next crew. In fact, we’d be activating human material in the nursery soon. Very soon. One child now, and then one every two or three years until we reached a total of 11. A full new crew. They let this sink in and then asked me if I had questions. I looked out. Nothing ever seemed to move. I felt I had to ask something. Talk like a grown-up. But I was stunned. “Do we remember this after being reclicked?” I didn’t recognize my own voice. “That we’ll never arrive. Do we remember that?” Sam got up and ran out, sobbing. Nobody went after her. “Depends,” Nefti said. “Some of us do. Some of us have to be reminded of this difficult truth.” I turned to Victor. I must have looked hurt or angry. “I’m so sorry,” he said. “We never tell children until they’re ready. Everyone here learned when they turned 13 and got their badges. Why burden …” He couldn’t finish the sentence. A long time went by, it felt like. “You’ll have many questions later on,” Nefti said. “Please come to us.” She paused and then turned to the whole group. “Now, about that reactor.” Nefti was right. Once I was on my own, all I had was questions. Never arrive? Was my only purpose in life to follow the protocols and take care of the nursery? Ensuring that the seeds in this ship be sown in new ground? Would I be expected to parent one of our successors, just like each of us had been parented by one previous crew member—just like Victor had parented me? How could he have lied to me all these years, telling me those stories about how we’d populate our new home with multitudes and birds and fish feeding fish feeding fish? But had he really lied to me? I tried to look back and remember. Had I ever been part of his stories about that new world? I looked out. Shut my eyes. Compared the blackness outside with the blackness inside. Thought of the nursery. Destroying it. “Forgive me,” I heard Victor say. I opened my eyes as he was withdrawing his hand, which had almost reached my shoulder. He sat on the floor, leaning against a wall, and invited me to do the same by gesturing to the opposite side of the corridor. I didn’t sit down. “I deserve your anger,” he said, looking up at me. “But maybe I can show you how to hate me in a gentle sort of way. In a way that doesn’t hurt you.” This was all very awkward. “I won’t be around for much longer. Your generation will take over now. I wish you’d been in the next one. I wish you’d been among those who landed.” He shook his head. “Whenever anger builds up in your heart, please make sure it’s always pointed at me and those who, like me, brought you into this. Make sure your anger is never pointed inward.” He held his forehead for a moment. “In time, you’ll look after one of our descendants. I know you’ll be much, much better at it than I ever was.” He got up slowly, in stages, and left. After this, I avoided being alone with Victor, fearing another intense moment with him. And I was right: He kept trying to find a chance to talk to me. At the nursery, he skipped his usual jokes and went straight to work, reading the numbers on the screens. But he’d often pause, take a breath, and look at me. Before he could start speaking, I’d begin with the next sequence of numbers. Soon he stopped trying. The rest of the day, I made sure to be surrounded by other people. For once, I was glad there’s so little privacy here. I spent most of my time with Nan and Lu. Finally learned why they laughed so hard in class: They kept swapping retouched little clips of Bibi—against absurd backgrounds, with her face disfigured by acid, with screwdrivers stabbing her eyeballs, with a saw ripping up her belly. I was glad to be included but didn’t find it funny. Not because of the gore and the guts. Just didn’t find it funny. Pretended to laugh. After class, once our shifts were over, the three of us would watch movies or play games. It was great to be one of them again. Still, I always left before we were done and was the first to bed, lying with eyes closed so no one would talk to me. At the next crew meeting, a week after my birthday, Robin made the announcement. A new person had been activated in the nursery. In nine months, we’d be welcoming our new little crew member—and first lander. I’d never heard that word before. Lander. That night, when I was facing my detached wall panel, pretending to be asleep, Victor came over to my bunk. “I know you’re awake,” he whispered. I didn’t turn to face him. Didn’t even open my eyes. “It’s okay. This way you won’t have to feel like you have to respond. I came to say goodbye. I’m leaving tomorrow, you see.” At this point I had to fight the urge to turn around. Leave where? How? “It was always meant to be this way, so there’s no reason to be sad. Please remain as stubborn and kind and strong as you are today. And if you can’t forgive me, I hope you can forget me.” He kissed my head. Didn’t hear him leave. I turn from the rippling water to look at Victor one last time. A line has formed as everyone gets ready to leave. I am last, but Robin holds me back as she covers Victor’s face with the sheet. “Are you all right?” she asks. My anger has lifted. But I fail to be as sad as I think I should be. I shrug. “Now that we have a full crew and we’ve begun to activate the next one, I think it’s time for you to turn the page. A clean slate. You’ll be reclicked today. Now, in fact. You could use a fresh start.” The first thing that crosses my mind is that I’ll have to memorize all those stupid nursery protocols again after the reclicking. Then I think of the foul stench that first hits you. Bodies. Piss. Recycled air. But immediately after, I remember Sam staring out the window. It’ll be nice to look out for the first time. “Why don’t you go and get ready. Label the things you don’t want to forget. We’ll be waiting for you.” I go to my bunk and look through my stuff. There isn’t much I really need to remember. I make a few notes for myself. A doll that has made it through all my reclickings gets a label. So does the loose wall paneling. “Nefti promised to fix!” I also write a reminder of the cleaning shift Lu owes me. Impossible to keep ignoring Victor’s book. I write “Don’t recycle!” on a label, attach it to the cover, and leave. But after taking a few steps, I turn around, go back, take the note off, rip it up, and put it in the recycling bin. The book, I put under my pillow."

        "story": "“Steve.” There is a pause. “Steve.” The tiny voice is adamant, frustrated. “Steeeeeeeeve.” Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. The man does not look up. “Steve. Steve. Steve,” she chants. It is early—always early. Carter, his daughter, laughs. “You’re Steve.” That his name is Haiden has ceased to matter. He would love, simply, to go by Dad, or Daddy, but since her third birthday weeks ago, Carter has been stubborn—or dedicated, depending on his vantage. At first Haiden balked at being called Steve. He was mortified by the comparison to a goofy kids’ YouTuber who seemed only to bald and pudge further in each new clip. Haiden gave up once he realized that Carter’s commitment was hitched to any frustration he expressed. And anyway, a kid wouldn’t think of it as a daily compromise of identity, would she? Light sprays in through the living-room window, misted with dust, turning the old wood floor golden. Haiden imagines the sun as a tiny hole in a faraway nozzle. He shuts his eyes. His wife, Hannah, is asleep in the next room; every room in their small apartment is the next room. Since Carter was nine months old, Haiden has been the one to get up with her each day and watch her until the nanny arrives. Hannah’s job is demanding, more important and more lucrative than his. The morning is his shift, his half of the parenting peace agreement. The morning is a trial of not counting down the minutes and trying to be present. “Da—” Carter catches herself. “Steve.” She pauses, leaning over to reach beneath the couch and grab the new toy that her aunt, Hannah’s sister, sent recently. A light-up drawing board that’s impossible to clean. “Let’s draw.” “Draw—now?” He’s tired. “Why?” “Because,” she says. The word sounds like “peecuz,” a quirk in her speech he knows he will miss later. She smears a strand of hair out of her face with the heel of her hand, holding out a peach-colored marker with the other. He sits up, regretting his question. “Of course we can. What should we draw?” “You draw something.” Carter jabs the marker at him. He takes it, and she flicks the background light off and on. She stares at his hand. He uncaps the marker, puts the tip against the board, and quickly picks it back up. “Please? Steve?” He stares at the drawing board once more. Streaks are smudged along the plastic. Again, nothing comes to him. On the living-room couch during sleepless nights, Haiden is limited to activities that don’t require light, lest the glare reach through the gaps in Carter’s blackout curtains on her French doors and wake her. This has never happened, but in the unlikely event that it did, he would be fucked. Tonight he lets an arm hang from the side of the couch. He feels a pull across his chest, a reminder that he should exercise, a reminder that he ignores. He thinks about listening to music or skimming the news on his phone’s dimmed screen, but he’s bored of both. On the floor, beneath his knuckle, he feels something smooth. He grazes it—a marker from Carter’s drawing board. He lifts and twirls it gently between his fingers, watching the slender beam of plastic in the dark. Turning to lean half off the cushion, the blood rushing to his head, he reaches down and pulls out the drawing board. He won’t turn its light on, of course, but his eyesight has adjusted to the darkness. The surface looks clean, though he knows it’s not, the way concrete walls in the city sometimes appear pristine at night. When he was younger, much younger, he loved how an alley wall looked under moonlight: the fine grain of concrete or coarse mortar, the scent of spray paint filling his nose. When he’d first started writing graffiti, he’d used latex gloves to hide the traces. Eventually he stopped because he enjoyed the constellation of color on his fingers the next morning. Loved scratching it away. If he was out tagging long enough, he could pick flecks of color from the hairs in his nostrils. Haiden uncaps the pen. The letters flow out seamlessly. The word is more familiar even than his signature: Moat. He follows the angled line from M to o, and the o as it swoops to form a lowercase a, tracks the tail of the a as it runs up to form the t, a final connection that had taken months to master. Haiden observes the tag in wonder—his tag—unwritten for more than 20 years. When he was a teenager, the word was arbitrary; the beauty of the tag lay in how each letter connected. It is now, he thinks, more precise and more refined than it used to be. It feels orchestrated and alive. He’s impressed by his mind’s retention. The muscle memory. He gets up from the couch and creeps to the bathroom, board under his arm, pen in hand. Carefully, he shuts the door; the toilet seat is cold through his briefs. He turns the board’s light on, imagining a billboard along a highway, lit under a heavy sky, a blank wall freshly painted. Fear had ruled him once—fear of police, of rival graffiti writers, of those who were fearless—but now he remembers the speed with which he would loop those shiny black letters along a wall, a roof, a mailbox. He wets some toilet paper and begins to scrawl and wipe, scrawl and wipe. He fills the board, which is not so unlike how he spends his days, a production artist tracing his pen against a digital tablet, enhancing the work of others. But this is different. He’s struck by how unthinking it is to get his tag down, though “getting up” is the term of art. This tag is him, not even the word itself so much as the motion and expression of it. Haiden hears a noise outside the closed door. He goes still, turning his head to listen. A shadow moves along the wall through the door’s frosted glass. Then a knock. He panics. “I’m in here.” “Are you okay?” Hannah’s voice is muted through the door. “I’m—” Maybe she imagines him masturbating, but sitting on the toilet with his daughter’s drawing board is somehow worse, more alarming. “Almost done,” he says. He watches her hazy form. “I need to pee.” “One sec.” Haiden turns on the faucet and lowers the board carefully into the tub. He will retrieve it in the morning when he’s up with Carter. He opens the door and smiles at Hannah. Her new haircut, much shorter and brushing her chin, is sexier for its messiness. As he attempts to inch past her, she reaches out and grabs his forearm. She pulls him back and kisses him with gently parted lips. His eyes close reflexively. “I’m gonna wash,” she says. “Wait up for me.” In the bedroom, the floor is cold beneath his feet. He finds a condom on a shelf above the headboard and sits on the bed. The blood inside him is a bifurcated stream pumping to his heart and his groin. Hannah comes back into the room naked, leans over her side of the bed and reaches into the bin below for lubrication. She’s used the cream since giving birth; the need for it, he’s decided, is no fault of his, but one of biology. He tries not to watch her, wary of imposing additional pressure. Each second is immense, and his focus disrupts his desire. He reaches slowly for a pillow and covers himself. The dense stitching from one of the pillow’s petals grazes his penis. “Wait,” Hannah says. He clenches the pillow tighter. “Fuck,” she says. “Fuck,” tossing the empty tube back into the bin. She falls back on the bed, facing away from him. He is shocked by the volume of her voice. He watches a loose ripple of skin form along her ribs. His condom slips, slightly, from his wilting erection. “We can still try?” she turns over to look up at him with large eyes. He sits on the bed with the pillow on his lap in the same way the drawing board had been moments before. “What?” she asks, palming his arm. “Nothing.” “Haiden, I’m trying.” That her effort needs underscoring annoys him. That effort is needed at all. Arousal, like anger, should be pure and instantaneous. He knows this isn’t fair. Still, he pulls away. From the next room comes a noise, which may mean Carter’s awake. He listens but hears nothing more. Hannah gets up and walks into the dark kitchen to open the fridge. She grabs a small container of orange juice as the light hits her bare thighs. She swigs the drink and her lips glisten with pulp. In the morning, it’s raining. The sound on the back of the AC unit is harsh. Somehow, when it pours, the apartment feels even smaller. Haiden stares at Carter’s nude torso, her belly button a chickpea. He’s on all fours; Carter wants to ride him around the living room like a horse. “Steve,” she says. “Go down.” He wonders which fate is worse—the horse’s or Steve’s. The answer, of course, doesn’t matter. He will be both. He will be anything she needs him to be. Her hands are warm on his neck, her weight a solace. Once, when she’d had a high fever, he’d sat with her in a rocking chair as she’d slept across his chest for hours. “Giddyup!” As they round the corner to the kitchen, they hear cautious knocking at the front door. Carter breathes in dramatically. Haiden is relieved by the distraction as she dismounts. He quickly slips her shirt over her head, and they approach the door down the hallway in mock suspicion. “Dada Haiden, what’s up?” It’s Tony, their upstairs neighbor. His hair is long, tied in a ponytail, and his beard is dense. Both are dark. Tony’s son, Markus, younger than Carter by three months, is behind Tony in the lobby of the apartment building. He appraises the many scooters and bikes parked below the staircase. Carter runs out the door, yelling his name repeatedly. “What’s up, Dada Tony?” Haiden had found this greeting challenging at first, but now he’s fond of it. “We’re going to the warehouse. You two want to join?” Tony’s warehouse, where he runs a small delivery company, is a spacious option for entertaining the kids on rainy days. “Check with the boss?” Tony jokes, jutting his chin at the apartment behind Haiden. This Saturday morning, Hannah would be grateful for a few more hours of sleep. The weather on Haiden’s phone reports rain all day. “Give me a few minutes to pack up.” Haiden knows Tony’s name isn’t really Tony from the labels on his Amazon boxes in the lobby. Tony is from Kyrgyzstan. He speaks English with a heavy accent, but very well. Tony’s wife, an Albanian woman, has Americanized his name for convenience, though she hasn’t done the same for herself. They ride to the warehouse in Tony’s van, which Markus and now Carter refer to as the “broom-broom.” Haiden does not own a broom-broom and has been reminded lately of the need for a broom-broom by both his wife and daughter. “Look, Steve.” Carter points out the window. Through the dripping pane is the water tower rising in the distance. Carter notices it every time they’re on the expressway. The first time she’d seen it, she’d described it as a toy rocket. “The water tower, Markus,” she says. Markus sits up in his car seat, yells out in recognition. Tony turns his head and grins through puffs from his vape pen. The warehouse is cold. Water leaks from the corners of the ceiling, a patchwork of wood and corrugated metal. Carter is enticed by all the foreign materials and devices—brackets, shiny clamps, bolts the size of flashlights. A pile of pale two-by-fours rests beside a shelf, and Haiden thinks of the sled Tony built for Markus last winter. Long and sturdy with curved, cradled seats. Haiden had taken Markus and Carter out to a hill one school-canceled, snowy afternoon and was stopped by envious parents holding their kids’ flimsy saucers. On a bottom shelf, Haiden spots a shallow box of spray paint, covered by a translucent tarp. He bends down and traces a finger along a can, the curved rusting edge of metal. It’s the famed brand of paint he used as a kid, the cans he’d buy with his allowance while claiming, to his friends, to have stolen them. Tony steps up. “We had to make custom shipping containers.” His voice is deep, raspy. “A wealthy customer wanted his shipments in black boxes, large black boxes. Spray paint was easiest. We spent weeks building them. He’s loyal, so I don’t ask.” Haiden stands slowly. His hips are weak. “You want it, old man?” Tony nudges the box of spray paint with the toe of his boot. “We haven’t used them since.” Whenever Tony notices Haiden noticing something, he offers it to him. This is true regardless of price or apparent worth. In the past, it has meant a VR headset and a mid-century chair. Haiden imagines these gestures pertaining to Kyrgyzstani culture somehow, an old-world traditionalism, because they’re distinctly un-American. “No, I—” Haiden pauses. “I used to spray-paint—write graffiti—when I was younger.” “The Soviets hated graffiti in my country,” Tony says. “My brother used to write his name on his bed frame over and over; drove my parents crazy.” He smiles at the ground, shakes his head as he does whenever he invokes his younger brother, after whom Markus is named. “Why did you stop?” The honest answer strikes Haiden as one that Tony would scoff at. Writing graffiti is risky in every sense; kids he knew growing up had been jumped or jailed for it. “Grew out of it, I guess.” “You know Baudelaire? ‘Genius means retrieving childhood at will.’ You should continue.” Typically, Haiden would have laughed off Tony’s advice, thought it facile, but he’d invoked Baudelaire. Haiden had never read Baudelaire. Tony claps his hands. “Who wants to see magic?” The kids dance in tight circles saying, “Me, me, me.” Tony gives them both earplugs that look like candy corn. He fits safety goggles around their small, round heads. He warns them to stand back—Haiden, surprisingly, too—as he lowers a circular blade’s teeth onto a piece of pipe. Sparks shoot outward as smoke rises from the metal. Carter’s eyes are glossy, the sparks slipping along her pupils. She leans forward, hands on her knees. “It just makes sense,” Hannah says. “Financial sense.” It is late—always late—and she has been offered another promotion. She and Haiden sit on the bed, not facing each other but side by side. They are both turned toward the wall, as if waiting for something to be projected onto it. “I’m asking you to be open.” It’s true that they would save money if Haiden cut back further at work; they’d no longer need the expensive full-time nanny. He could pick Carter up from preschool in the afternoons. “Money can’t be the only reason,” Haiden says. “Why are you so attached to your job all of a sudden?” His attachment isn’t to the job itself, but to the distraction it offers. He was never supposed to be a production artist for this long. Working for an ad agency had been a stopgap. “You want to live in this box forever?” she asks. He turns to the window, visualizing the magnolia tree waiting to bloom in someone else’s yard. Maybe he’s not ready, just yet, to think about moving, or buying a house, with the same degree of urgency. “We need more space.” She crawls her fingers toward him. “And besides, Carter loves being with you.” “I barely have any freedom left to give up.” He feels pathetic, pleading with her. “You’d be doing it for us.” Is he selfish? he wonders. He remembers, when he started going to work again after paternity leave, how Monday mornings began to feel like Friday nights, with all they promised. “With this raise, we’ll have a down payment in six months.” He is losing; he can feel it. He was losing even before he opened his mouth. She rubs his bare thigh in a way that feels infantilizing, though he knows she’s trying. “You’ll have your moment.” “So you at least understand the moment isn’t now.” He is impatient, angry. “Don’t dangle the hope of some improved future moment in front of me. It’s pathetic.” Her tone loses its former warmth. “Pathetic for you or me?” Carter is perched on Haiden’s shoulders, her tender calves in his grip. As they leave the apartment building, she reaches to grab a metal pole in the scaffolding above. He adjusts his balance under the motion of her shifting weight. “Steve,” she says, twisting again, “it’s Markus!” Tony’s van is double-parked down the block. The hazards are flashing, the sliding door open. Markus sits alone, feet dangling from the runner, eating gummy worms. This means Carter will want to join him. “Where’s Dada?” Haiden asks Markus. “He’ll be right back.” Markus holds a yellow-and-green worm in the air, slick and chewed. Carter reaches for it. Tony calls out sweetly to Carter as he approaches the van. He and Haiden bump fists. “Get in your seat, Markus.” Tony turns to Haiden. “You two want a ride in the broom-broom?” After dropping the kids off at preschool, Tony says he wants to show Haiden something. They return to the van and Tony offers to take him downtown, to work, after the detour. Haiden only now notices the cans of spray paint at the foot of the passenger seat. The labels are shinier than before. Hayden thinks that maybe Tony has cleaned them. He picks one up and inspects the tiny ribbed cap, rests his finger on the groove. Tony instructs Haiden to bring the cans with him as he parks. They pass Tony’s warehouse, rounding the corner through an alley. Tony opens a door the color of clay. “Neighbor,” Tony takes a pull from his vape. “He’s a set designer but he left the space early. Said I can use it for another month or so. They will scrub the place after we’re done.” This warehouse is huge, its walls smooth concrete, blank except for a few notations and measurements marked in wax pencil. “Show me,” Tony says, nodding his head at the wall. “Show you what?” “I want to see how you do it.” “Here?” Haiden demurs. “You’re sure it’s okay?” Tony’s laughter is raucous. It is almost cruel as it echoes. Haiden crouches beside the cans like a golfer gaming out a putt. He lifts one, shakes it, and the ball inside clacks against the tin. The sound sends a chill across his arms, his neck. He’s forgotten how close to stand; he runs his palm across the wall, rubs dust between his fingers. He sprays a quick black line. The smell is sharp and expansive. He remembers, then, the special spray caps he’d ordered from a graffiti magazine as a kid. The night after the small, flat nozzles had arrived, he’d sneaked out to a nearby bridge that was closed for construction. He’d realized he had to return home, after hours of filling the bridge’s hulking concrete columns, only when he saw the neon vest of a construction worker showing up as the sun rose. He turns to look at Tony. He takes two steps back. “What does it say?” Tony asks, tilting his head. “Moat.” “Like a castle?” Haiden nods. Tony crosses his arms. “Continue,” he says. All that wall: The way surfaces take on fresh meaning once they’re available to him—the experience comes back to Haiden. It’s like seeing the world at a new frequency, like noticing a secret plane that very few people have access to. He proceeds. He holds the cap down and slows his hand, allowing drips to form; splays the cap out for fat, diffuse letters. Each Moat possesses its own quality, a distinctness amid the apparent uniformity of the pattern. A row emerges and Haiden wants to fill the entire wall, floor to ceiling. Tony is eager to facilitate, running out to grab a ladder from his warehouse. Haiden then works vertically, slowly, to fill the upper portion of the wall. When Tony heads back outside to talk to one of his drivers, Haiden realizes he’s now late for work. He doesn’t bother pulling out his phone to email. He stops, moving the ladder aside. He walks backwards to the opposite wall to take in his effort. He steps toward the center of the space, blurring his eyes and focusing. The smell makes him briefly light-headed. He looks down at his side, his hands flared with black. “I can’t keep them waiting,” she says. Haiden knows he’s pushing it. “It’s fine.” “Fine—what’s fine?” Hannah strokes Carter’s tawny head as Carter turns her drawing board right side up to study a recent doodle. The three of them are seated in the living room, which gives the conversation the air of a family meeting. “Go for it,” he says. “I’ll cut back. It makes sense.” “So why do you seem down?” “I’m saying it’s fine.” “I don’t want it to be fine, is the point. I want you to be happy. For me, at least.” Carter turns her head slightly to look at Haiden and then back at her drawing board. He’d always expected fatherhood to change him, and it had, certainly, yet it never managed to overrule his other selves. “I know you think this is strictly about my career,” Hannah continues, “but it’s not. I’ve thought a ton about what this means for us. After everything. Think of a house—you can have a studio space, do whatever the hell you want in it.” He nods. It’s not the worst thing to imagine. “Think of how good it will be for Carter in the short term. She’ll be so happy.” Carter looks sidelong at Haiden before sticking her tongue out and smiling. Hannah is asleep, scissoring the striped comforter between her legs. A gentle wheeze in her nose. Haiden looks at her chapped and almost-smiling mouth. He decides he’s okay with his decision. Hannah had cried after they talked again, after Carter was down, her tears eased by the gratitude she expressed. This is worth something, he thinks. Haiden can’t remember the last time he lay awake in a state of true anticipation. Of readiness. The spray paint is in the hall closet, under the coats and behind the plastic tub with detergents and cleaners. He gets up and walks carefully across the old wood floor. He reaches into the closet and pulls a can free. Next, he eases open the front door and brings his shoes and jacket out into the hallway, resting them on the bench by the mailboxes. The radiator hisses as he pulls his gray beanie out of his pocket. The darkness is muddy outside. The air cool. His shoulders are tight, the spot where his tension is stored. One benefit of cutting back at work is that he will no longer be hunched for hours every day. A block away is the renovated movie theater, with its large exposed wall rising above the roof of its squat neighbor. He crosses the street, walks beneath the art deco marquee, wanders down to the alley’s entrance. Two cars cruise by on the street, smoke blowing from the passenger window of one. He’s studied the various points of entry and exit while out with Carter: He must pull himself up onto a low window ledge and from there climb the fire escape. The ladder is flaking, and he regrets not bringing gloves, but without much trouble he makes his way up the metal stairs to the roof’s edge. The view of the street makes him feel unsteady, so he shuts his eyes. The wind whips against his lids. He looks up at the wall. Down the street, a dim light is on in Tony’s apartment, a floor above his own. Haiden wishes he could send him some kind of signal. He wishes Tony could be his witness. From the ladder, he steps over the lip of the roof and then onto a dark swath of something, a loose panel among many scattered across the roof’s surface. The ground beneath his feet is softer than he’d imagined. Haiden walks a couple of yards, grabs the can from his coat pocket, and takes a wide step back to test the spray against the roof. He trips, his foot catching on the edge of one of the panels. He falls hard. The noise of the can against the roof seems conspicuously loud, and he remains flat on his back to stay out of sight. He feels a sharp pain in his elbow, some nerve-induced static along his forearm. After a minute, he rolls over and crawls to grab the can, resting his hands on it and then laying his head on his hands. There’s not much ambient noise except the wind, the shimmering trees. He gets up to face the wall, spraying with speed. Then he jogs back to the fire escape. “Steve,” her little voice says. “Look.” Carter has slipped her pants off for a third time and Haiden is verging on surrender. He’s tired. As he remembers the reason he didn’t sleep, he’s distracted momentarily from his fatigue. “Come on, we’re gonna be late.” Carter is silent at first. “Fine,” she says, which sounds like “foyne.” (He will miss this later too.) Haiden is surprised to hear Hannah moving in their bedroom. “Come on, Carter. Let’s get going.” Carter’s dress is tucked into the back of her pants and her feet are bare. He grabs a pair of socks from her closet and sticks them in his pocket, slipping her backpack from the hook beside the kitchen door. His hand is speckled with black. The bedroom door opens, and Hannah’s sleepy, slitted eyes focus on him. “Come here for a sec?” she says. He hands Carter her balled socks with his hand, the clean one, aware he will have to adjust her socks later. “Where did you go last night? I came out and you weren’t on the couch.” “I was probably in the bathroom?” He turns to Carter. “You good with your socks, bud?” “When you were back in bed you smelled … smelled like, I don’t even know. Like paint.” Haiden’s hand is hidden by Carter’s sky-blue backpack at his side. “Paint?” he says. “What do you mean?” Carter clues in. “I want to paint!” Hannah furrows her brow. “Is this about my job?” “You think I’m huffing fumes or something? I don’t get it.” She watches him. “Radical honesty, remember?” Carter walks past. “Bye, Mommy.” Hannah kisses her hair. She rubs a thumb across her forehead, smiling behind her dangling bangs. She turns to Haiden. “Whatever’s going on—” “Don’t worry,” he interrupts. “Grab some sleep.” Before leaving, he blows a kiss through his balled fist. A love-dart gun, as he’d originally conceived of it. Outside, his tag is a stark glyph in the morning light. It doesn’t look as impressive as he’d hoped, but it’s there. Carter, on his shoulders, has an ideal view of it. They walk to the corner and Haiden lingers, pretends to search for something inside his jacket. His elbow is sore. “Go. Go.” She bucks on his shoulders. “The light is green.” He stands straight up and positions her toward the theater, but Carter fails to notice. At school, he kneels to hang the backpack from her shoulders. She pulls the straps tight as Ms. Adrienne holds the door open. “You forgot something,” he says when Carter walks in. This is a game they play. She runs back out and hugs him, leans her head on his shoulder. “Were you all painting?” Ms. Adrienne asks, nodding her curls at his hand. “Where are you tonight, Moat?” Tony asks. “You and I are grabbing drinks.” In the van, Haiden watches the graffiti pass by from the highway. It appears on distant billboards and shadowed underpasses. All the space seems vast. “I didn’t think you’d agree,” Tony says. Haiden doesn’t read too much into the comment. He repositions his backpack at his feet. He’s here, after all. They exit down a ramp into industrial territory. Tony leans his head over the steering wheel and looks up through the windshield. He searches the tops of the buildings. Haiden feels nervous suddenly. “Almost there,” Tony says. They turn onto a long block of warehouses, a streetlight at the corner stuttering. Haiden thinks of Hannah sleeping, of Carter, but shakes off the images. “You’re quiet,” Tony says. “Mental preparation,” he tries to joke. Tony parks; the van sighs to silence. “It’s up there.” Tony points to a tall concrete facade. “The water tower is on top.” Haiden realizes that he has only ever seen it from afar, driving by. “There’s some scaffolding,” Tony says. “It blocks the view partially from the highway. Once the construction is complete, all the cars will see.” It feels real now, all of it. Haiden pulls his backpack onto his lap. They both scan the surroundings. “When you’re up there, make sure the ladder is sturdy before you climb.” He grabs a pair of gloves and hands them to Haiden. Then he stops suddenly. Haiden stops too. They both listen to the distant sound of sirens. Tony eyes Haiden, grabbing the key ring, still in the ignition, but doesn’t turn it. The noise of the sirens grows jarringly loud before coming to a halt. Tony pulls his hand away and sits back. Lights flare faintly from the adjoining street. He starts the van then and does a slow 180. At the corner, he makes a right turn and then another, driving past the street where police cars, two of them, have pulled up to a garage. Haiden can make out only one officer, leaning against his door, which is wedged open. “What should we do?” Haiden asks quietly. “Do?” Tony fishes his vape from the cup holder. “Go home.” “The cops won’t be out there all night.” Tony looks at him with mild surprise. “There will be other nights.” “Can’t we drive around, or go grab food and come back? What are the chances they return to this exact spot?” “The police aren’t lightning. It’s possible.” “Think about it; it’s probably safer for us that this happened.” “There could be more surveillance, backup. Who knows what the fuck goes on inside of that garage?” Whatever it might be fails to compete with Haiden’s adrenaline. To delay the momentum would be to threaten it completely. He leans back against the headrest. “Dada Haiden,” Tony reaches over and squeezes Haiden’s shoulder. Haiden flinches from the pain, and shrinks away. “It doesn’t have to be right now.” Haiden shuts his eyes and clenches his jaw. He rests his hand on the door’s handle. “You’ll have your chance.” “Just let me out,” he says. “Up here.” “What? No, man. No way.” “Just do it.” Tony stares at him, as if awaiting a punch line. “You’re coming home with me.” Haiden is silent. “Don’t be crazy. Think about Carter.” At the stop sign, Haiden grabs his bag and hops out of the passenger seat. Slams the door. Tony rolls down the window and yells after him, but Haiden doesn’t look back. He jogs down the street, listens for the van to pull away, which eventually it does. He’s cold now, unsure of where he’s heading as he leaves the water tower behind. He pulls on the straps of his backpack. The exercise, should he decide to walk the three or maybe four miles home, will be useful. In the distance, an 18-wheeler passes by and gradually disappears on the elevated expressway. He flips on his hood, cinches it tight. The backpack bounces gently as he walks, and he can hear, just barely, the sound of the cans rattling inside it. A few blocks ahead, Haiden notices a van slowly coming toward him. He takes a deep breath before registering Tony’s face. Tony nods his head and parks. The street is dark, and the only other car is parked on the opposite side. Haiden walks by the blue sedan, which looks like it’s been sitting there for years. Tony holds his hand out. “I want my own.” Haiden smiles. He unzips his bag and hands Tony a can, which Tony then tucks into the waistband of his pants. There will be many surfaces for them to hit, lesser monuments than the water tower, but still. Haiden reaches into his pocket and feels the flat caps he ordered—for fat and skinny lines—pulls them out and opens his palm. A coin from Carter’s toy cash register is mixed in, almost the exact shape and weight. His daughter is likely dreaming now. He won’t have trouble making it back home before she’s up."

        "story": "They had been driving for hours, and the city still hadn’t loosened its grimy hold. Now there were bungalows and shops that clung to both sides of the highway; roadside tea stalls with corrugated roofs, where truck drivers stopped to stretch their legs; bustling townships that only a few years ago had been villages of mud huts, their walls covered with circular cowpats; new tollbooths, petrol bunks, and hotels promising hot water and clean rooms. It wasn’t until the family in the car saw the first wisp of cloud hanging over the hillside that they felt they had finally broken free. The father switched off the air conditioner and rolled down his window. He had recently bought a white Maruti Zen. The fingertips of his left hand guided the steering wheel, exerting the mildest pressure, letting the car do the rest. At 39 years old, he had recently been promoted to bank-branch manager. The past three summers, around the time when the heat in the city grew fangs, he’d taken his family to Crown Resorts, nestled in the tea plantations of Kodaikanal, a hill station some 500 kilometers outside Bangalore. The mother, sitting next to him, drummed her fingers on her thighs. The first sight of the hills always agitated her, their peaks swaddled in gray-and-purple shadow. The vegetation on the slopes looked darker than the shrubs and trees dotting the plains. Idly, illogically, she wondered why. Wasn’t it closer to the sun up there? In the back seat, their daughter was trying to read. She hated car journeys, though she looked forward to being at the resort, where, she knew from previous visits, there would be table tennis, long walks, and a sweet white rabbit in a hutch. A Walkman lay on the seat next to her. The tangled cord of its earphones shivered with the motion of the car. She was 11 years old and had started bleeding for the first time that morning. Her mother had steered her by the shoulders into the bathroom, where the mirror was still fogged from whoever had last taken a bath. She made her daughter sit on the toilet. She removed a Kotex pack from the cabinet and explained how to affix the thick pad to her underwear. The girl had found walking with the pad uncomfortable but said nothing. Now she reached beneath her book and pressed the new thickness. Streaks of pain were shooting low in her belly, but she did not want to bring it up in the car. The fact of the pad, the intimacy of being alone with her mother inside the bathroom, all of it had created a new distance from her father. Where she was sitting, she could see his smooth cheek. His mustache obscured his upper lip, his left ear. Suddenly there were hairpin turns, signaled by yellow signs with curved black arrows. Each time they navigated one, the father would list theatrically to the side. “Hoooold on!” he would yell, while the mother and daughter remained silent. Later, when they got higher and the roads got narrower, he fell silent, too. From time to time, a tourist bus speeding downhill would block nearly the entire road. The father would have to yank the wheel sharply to avoid it. The hillside loomed on their right, a dark-red wall. The daughter suddenly had the impression of it collapsing and burying the car under a million tons of dirt. She dropped her head to her chest as if to avoid the colossal weight. On another hairpin turn, her stomach heaved. “Stop,” she said quietly. But her father was concentrating on driving and her mother had her eyes closed. “Stop,” she repeated. Her mother looked around. When she saw the daughter’s face, she became alert. “Stop the car.” “I can’t,” said the father. “It’s a blind turn.” “Stop!” cried the daughter. The father jammed the brakes. The girl flung the door open, leaned out, and threw up her breakfast. The taste was so vile that she threw up again. Her mother moved to open her door. “Don’t get out!” snapped the father. “I’ll get the water bottle from the back.” “You’re going to get hit by a car.” “Don’t be so dramatic.” “Do you not see how narrow the road is?” “She’s throwing up.” He looked at his daughter with his hands still on the wheel. “Baby, are you okay?” The daughter nodded. “She’s fine. Just stay in the car,” the father told the mother. To his daughter, he said, “Close the door, baby. You can drink water as soon as we reach the resort.” The mother said nothing. The daughter shut the door and the father released the hand brake. The car slid back a foot and all three of them felt a simultaneous burst of terror. Then the tires caught, and they started uphill again. The mother spotted the resort first. “There,” she said: a series of red brick buildings peeking through the trees. The father felt like honking but didn’t, because his daughter had fallen asleep. They remained quiet as they turned off the highway at a handwritten sign that said Crown Group 15 KM. The dirt road twisted past hamlets, where men in sleeveless sweaters watched them from small yards. A woman hanging laundry paused with a pair of green shorts in her hands. A toddler wandered behind some knock-kneed goats, who, at the sound of the car, bumped against one another. The bells around their necks woke the daughter up. A boy no older than 12, dressed in a baggy blue uniform, showed them to their red brick cottage. He wore black shoes many sizes too large for him and tripped on the steps. The father placed a hand on his shoulder and said, “Be careful.” He remembered how, in the hospital, when they put his baby in his arms and told him it was a girl, he had felt the briefest whisper of disappointment. Mortified, he banished the feeling, though he was sure his newborn daughter had sensed it. Her tiny, crumpled face had closed like a bud. Now, as they entered the cottage, he put his arm around his daughter. The daughter’s bones shifted under her T-shirt. She remained still for a few seconds, then wriggled free from his embrace. The mother looked around. She saw a room with a plywood cupboard and a double bed with white sheets. Beside it was an extra cot, an ugly orange love seat, and a low coffee table. The door to the bathroom stood ajar, exposing a strip of tile. Next to the bathroom was a dressing table with a cloudy mirror in which she glimpsed the three of them, their bodies strange and elongated. She turned away. “It’s fine,” she said. The father tried to sound jolly. “It’s a palace!” The boy remained in the room. The father took out his wallet and gave him five rupees. He took it, shot a glance at the daughter, who was rinsing her mouth in the bathroom, and then raced out. The daughter lay down on her cot, pushing aside her Walkman and book. The sheets felt cool and papery on her skin. She wished her father would go away so that she could take her shirt off. The mother sat at the edge of the double bed and picked up the resort telephone. “What are you doing?” the father asked. “Ordering tea.” “Why don’t we have it in the clubhouse?” he said. “We can look around, see what changes they’ve made since last year.” She was already dialing. “Room service? I’m calling from cottage number—” She looked at her husband. “Five.” “Cottage number five,” the mother said into the phone. “We need three cups of tea, please. Make it piping hot, understand? Hot. So hot that it burns my tongue.” She hung up. In a low voice the father said, “Three cups?” He nodded in the direction of the daughter, who pretended not to hear. “Why not?” The mother shrugged. “She can’t drink milk forever.” While they waited, the daughter went to take a shower. She found that morning’s newspaper sticking out of her mother’s handbag and took it into the bathroom. With scientific interest, she examined the rusty, blackened blotch on the pad in her underwear. She peeled the pad off, wrapped it in the front page of the newspaper, and threw it away. In the shower, a little blood ran down her left thigh, blushing the tiles. When she came out, a thermos of tea had arrived and her mother and father sat side by side on the love seat. The daughter perched cross-legged on her cot as her mother poured the steaming liquid into three cups. Then she added milk from a steel pitcher, and a spoonful of sugar for each. The daughter sipped her tea. It was sweet, but she felt a corrosive bite at the back of her throat, which she knew came from the tea leaves. The father tilted his cup to admire its contents. “Now this is the genuine thing.” He’d said something similar last year. “Grown right over there.” He pointed to the rows of bushes outside the window. “No comparison to the stuff we drink in the city. None whatsoever.” “They could have made it hotter,” said the mother. The daughter sipped hers again, trying to decide whether or not she liked it. “Better than Brooke Bond Red Label,” said the father. “Better than Lipton. Best tea in the world. Brought to you by Kodaikanal Hill Station!” He made it into a jingle. “Hill Station Tea! The tea for you, and the tea for me!” His voice was a supple tenor. “How are you feeling?” the mother asked the daughter, who had begun to smile at her father’s song. At her mother’s question, she stopped smiling. “I’m fine.” “What happened?” asked the father. “Do you still feel sick from before?” “No,” said the daughter. “Poor baby,” he said. “You’re like me. I used to get sick when I was a child, too. Not in a car, mind you. My parents never had a car. We traveled by bus. But they always made sure I sat near the driver. I would tell him if I felt sick, and he would stop the bus to let me out. Back then,” the father said, “you could do those kinds of things.” Soon the sun would set. The moon was already up over the hills, motionless in a drifting haze. The father started putting on his shoes, the pair of Nike sneakers he had purchased especially for this trip from the outlet shops in Marathahalli. “Who wants to go for a walk?” he asked. “Can we play with the rabbit?” asked the daughter. “On the way back.” He looked at the mother. “I think I’ll order another cup of tea,” she said. The daughter and the father left the resort gates and walked up the dirt driveway that came to a fork. “You choose,” he said. “Which way?” The daughter considered. Going left would take them to the paved road by which they’d arrived. The path on the right swooped down out of sight to some unknown place. She could see the sinuous curves of bicycle tires in the dirt. “Right,” the daughter said. “That goes to the local village.” He’d been hoping she’d say left. He wanted a view of the entire plantation from the ridge as the sun went down. It was the scene he’d envisioned most often as he sat at his desk in the bank. But he’d asked her and she’d said right. The descent was steeper than it looked. He leaned back to keep from breaking into a trot. His daughter ran in bursts, sprinting for a few yards and then stopping herself. “Be careful,” the father said. “I smell cows,” she said, ignoring him. “Cow dung,” he said. “There wouldn’t be cow dung without cows.” The statement struck him as clever. The village was as he remembered: a motley collection of buildings, cubes of brick painted in bright colors. A chemist and a barbershop and a ration shop. One building boasted a painted sign reading PRETTY WOMAN HAIR SALOON. A nearby tree had a metal garbage can lashed to its trunk, but still there was garbage everywhere—flattened juice cartons, crumpled newspapers, empty chip packets, and vegetable scraps. On a bench, a tall young man in a lungi sat reading a Tamil newspaper. One bare foot was stretched out, the other tucked beneath him. He rustled the paper every few seconds and kept glancing up at them. “Good evening,” said the father. The man looked up and back down quickly. He hid his face behind the paper. “Hello,” the father said again. The young man lowered the paper. “You are guests from Crown?” “Yes,” said the father. “But we’re not really guests. We’ve been coming for about five or six years.” He hoped his daughter wouldn’t correct him. He only meant to prove that they were not strangers to the place. The man nodded. “Have they told you about the tiger?” The father thought the man must mean the local circus. “What tiger?” “My uncle found two of his goats. Dead. Over there.” He raised his hand and gestured. “It’s as big as a buffalo. A male tiger.” The daughter’s stomach clenched with excitement. She felt a few hot drops of blood trickle out. She was terrified until she remembered the pad. “How do you know it was a tiger? Did your uncle actually see it?” asked the father sharply. He noticed that his daughter had gone stiff. After a pause, the man tapped his own chest. “You saw it?” the father pressed. “You saw the tiger with your own eyes?” The man stared. Then, of all things, a long, wet-sounding fart escaped him. He giggled and again shook his newspaper, which, the father suddenly noticed, was old and yellowed. The father relaxed. The man was obviously unwell. The father leaned toward his daughter and whispered, “It’s okay. Don’t be scared, baby.” “I’m not,” she said. And he had to admit that she didn’t look it. The father thought then of a peon at his bank, an undernourished boy whose job it was to distribute tiny paper cups of coffee all day long. A few months before, the boy had come to work in tears. He told everyone how he had gone on safari at Bannerghatta Park with his uncle. A tiger had dragged a young girl out of a jeep and proceeded to eat her in front of everyone. The father remembered reading about the incident in the newspaper, and from then on, he would give the boy a rupee every few days to tidy his desk or empty his dustbin. Each time he pressed a coin into his small palm, the boy smiled gratefully. Now the father scolded the man. “Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing, but you shouldn’t tell stories like that in front of small children.” The daughter wanted to stay and hear more about the tiger, but her father began to pull her away. She tugged her hand free and dawdled, watching him huff up the path. He was a petite man clearly unused to exertion. With his regular office clothes, the Nikes looked ridiculous. Suddenly she could no longer bear it, and she started to run, overtaking him quickly. She heard him shout her name, but she didn’t stop. When she arrived, panting, at cottage five, her mother was already asleep. The next morning, a buffet was laid out in the courtyard. The mother took one look at the food and said to the nearest waiter, “Tea. Make sure it’s hot. Understand?” “You have to eat,” said the father. He’d woken before anyone else and had crept outside to watch the sunrise over the hills. At first, the rows of tea leaves looked like they’d been soaked in ink, but as the sun got higher, they released a green shimmer. He’d gone back inside and laid down next to his wife, somehow glad that he had been the only one to witness it. “I’m not hungry,” said the mother. “If you collapse on the hike, don’t blame me,” said the father. He’d taken a little bit of everything: the poori-chana, the baked beans, the eggs. He cleaned his plate and then ate two slices of toast and a bowl of cornflakes. A few cubes of watermelon. His appetite was never this healthy in the city. The daughter picked at her food. Cramps had attacked her in the middle of the night, and she had tossed for an hour before they subsided. She could have simply woken her mother and asked for some Crocin, but at the time, listening to the distant hush of the hills, it had felt right to bear the pain alone. The father looked at both of them. “Neither one is eating,” he remarked to the air. “Must be on a diet.” In the afternoon, they picked up sandwiches from the resort kitchen and set off. The daughter wore shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt. The mother wore a salwar kurta and old Keds, and carried a bag with food and water. The father hung a camera around his neck. They turned left at the gate and walked up the dirt road. Each time a vehicle passed, they walked in single file. “I think we should turn off now,” the father said. The path he pointed to split from the road, plunging down through the trees. They followed it for 20 minutes as it inscribed a wide, meandering curve. Then it lost itself abruptly in a tangle of wild grass and skinny trees. The mother and daughter stopped. The father stepped over a branch shaped like a stretching dog. “This way,” he said. As if to reward him, the path burst into view again. He felt a quiet vindication at not having led his family astray. “What trees are these?” the daughter asked, looking up. They had smooth gray bark, and their branches were thin and very high. The mother spoke after a silence. “Tea trees.” The daughter watched her glance at her husband. “No, they’re not,” the daughter said. “They’re not tea trees.” “Why not?” asked her mother. “We’re on a tea plantation, aren’t we? Everything around here is tea-something. Ask your father if you don’t believe me.” The father hated when his wife made remarks like that. He often suspected they were intended to prove to him something unflattering about himself, though he couldn’t have explained what it was. He waited for his daughter to ask him about the trees, but she didn’t. The path began to climb. The family fell into the rhythm of walking. For a long time, there was no sound except the snapping of twigs and the subdued conference of leaves. The path shot down, ambled through a clearing, and extinguished itself near a pretty brook. The father squatted by the bank and splashed his face with water. “Cows do number two in that water,” said the daughter. She pointed to the evidence: a fresh cowpat right at the edge of the stream, gently lapped by water. “Bloody hell!” The father stood and backed away quickly. The mother had seated herself on a rock. The daughter went over and rummaged in her bag for the bottle of water. The father came toward them. “Give me the bottle after you’ve finished, baby,” he said. The daughter threw her head back and drank. The water fell in a silver stream that never touched her lips. She handed the bottle to her father, who poured water into his cupped palm and scrubbed his face. The bottle was almost empty when he had finished. The daughter’s cramps returned, and with them a pervasive exhaustion. She fell behind her parents as they walked. She thought about her bed in cottage five, its sheets pulled tight as violin strings, and the fan beating above her. She wanted to weep. Her mother, with uncanny perception, turned. “Pain again?” She nodded. “Want to go back?” The mother’s tone was indifferent, neutral. The father stopped, too. “Is she getting cranky?” he asked the mother. “I’m not cranky,” the daughter said. “I’m just not feeling well.” “You didn’t eat breakfast,” the father said. “I told you to eat, didn’t I? Do you want something now? Should we stop and have lunch?” “I just want to lie down,” the daughter whimpered. “I’ll take her back,” the mother said. “You keep hiking.” Suddenly, the father wanted to slap his wife. In 13 years of marriage, he had never raised a hand to her, but now he wanted to hit her as hard as he could. The week before their wedding, which had been arranged through a series of relatives, he’d torn a sheet from a notepad and made a numbered list. 1. Provide financial stability to family unit. 2. Be mentor/inspiration to children. 3. Respect individual preferences of spouse. “No, you stay,” the father said on impulse. “I’ll take her back.” The mother looked surprised for a moment, then shrugged. “If you want to.” “Go on, keep hiking. Enjoy yourself. Don’t worry about us. We’ll be fine. Take your time.” “The Crocin is in the suitcase,” the mother told the daughter. “Take one tablet, then sleep.” She brushed her daughter’s forehead. The girl startled at the touch, which was gentle but somehow lifeless. She was nearly glad to be walking away with her father. His new Nikes were already stained with dirt and grass. The mother stood looking after them, her hip cocked at an angle to support the bag. Now the mother was alone. This was what she had wanted, wasn’t it? She had wished and wished for it, the words drumming in her head since they’d started walking, since her eyes had opened that morning: I would like to be alone. I would like to be alone.  And here she was. Alone. She continued uphill, in the direction they’d been going earlier as a family. The light changed on the forest floor, filtered through the high branches. She thought about what she’d said to her daughter. Tea trees. Ask your father. She’d noticed the embarrassment in her husband’s expression, and she regretted it a little now. But at the time she’d felt nothing but a mild curiosity about how he would respond. She was almost sure there were no such things as tea trees. The forest thinned as she approached a ridge. She saw a solid bank of light up ahead where the tree line ended. The sounds of women’s voices reached her, like snatches of a song. Her pace quickened. She steadied the bag and stepped out, and, yes, the hill stretched down and away from her at her feet, exactly as she’d thought it would—covered with long, seemingly endless rows of tea. The rows pleased her with their precision. The space in between them as narrow and strict as a school corridor. The bag on her shoulder filled now with books, pencils. Her black shoes polished that morning by her father on their veranda, bare-chested, lungi wrapped around his waist. Objects from a wooden box spread around him. Two brushes: one for black shoes, one for brown. A rag. Tin of polish. A glossy shoehorn. He puts his hand into her shoe, wearing it like a glove. He nestles it in his lap and makes it shine, even the thin strap that crosses the top of her foot. A perfect job every time. Women were visible on the slopes, among the tea bushes, with baskets strapped to their backs. The mother could see them scattered: tiny colorful figures stuck between the rows like scraps of bright cloth caught in a dark-green mesh. Her husband was always encouraging her to find friends. He had suggested she take a cooking class, join a women’s badminton team. Once, he even brought home a racket and a barrel of glue-stiff shuttles—but she never touched them. In the end, it was their daughter who’d been enrolled in badminton coaching. Otherwise, he came home from work and told her about his colleagues’ wives, how they planned to attend a handloom-handicraft exhibition at the palace grounds. Maybe she should join them, buy herself a new sari. He was secure at work; they could afford a little indulgence every now and then. Pamper yourself. That was his phrase. He’d grown up poor. So had she. One of the tea pickers was walking toward her. With each step, the woman’s hands shot out in either direction, neatly plucking the tender, topmost leaves of the bushes and flinging them over her shoulder into the basket on her back, which, the mother noticed now, was actually secured to her head. A yellow cloth strap passed across her forehead like a bridle. When the woman reached the end of the row, she stopped. “Hello,” the mother said, suddenly shy. The tea picker emerged and stood on the path. She was dressed in a man’s plaid shirt, buttoned up to the throat, and a checkered lungi down to her ankles. Her chin was lifted in a way that looked haughty, but that was because she had to hold her neck rigid to counter the basket’s weight. The mother noticed that the tea picker had small hands with fine, almost childlike, fingers. Tea hands, she thought. Tea hands, tea trees. Why not? There had been a time when the mother had known how to talk to women like this one. For one glorious year after college, before her father called to say he’d found someone for her, she’d worked for an NGO. She’d travel by train or bus from village to village, giving presentations on family planning, the use of birth control, sexually transmitted diseases. She’d watch hardened, work-worn women struggle through stages of shame and suspicion until, finally, she was rewarded with a deluge of curiosity. They’d ask endless questions once they had determined she was to be trusted. What if my husband never washes down there; will I get an infection? I’ve heard that if you lie in a certain way during the act, then your baby will be a boy; is that true? With what ease she’d discussed these things, with what intensity they’d listened, these strangers becoming, in a sense, her sisters and aunts and cousins and nieces. They’d feed and fuss over her, insisting that she stay overnight, and she often did, accepting with alacrity the coir cot she was given. Then the talk would go on for hours more. Other women would join after the day’s work had ended, after they’d cooked and cleaned and put their families to bed, and she would look around at these women, who’d known poverty and death and physical labor beyond anything she could imagine, giggling and squealing like girls, and her heart would swell with love. That morning, she had stood looking down at her daughter in their steamy bathroom, the child’s face shiny with fear and embarrassment at the changes in her body, and she had felt nothing. It should have been the other way around: with the women, cool professionalism; with her daughter, the hot urgency of maternal love. But it had turned out not to be so. The least she could do was offer assistance. Here, she had said in the bathroom, taking the pack of Kotex pads from the cabinet. This is how you do it. “Lookout Point?” said the tea picker abruptly. “Excuse me?” “Lookout Point.” The tea picker pointed with a slender finger. “Go that way and you will see a board. All guests from the resort go there. It is a high place with a nice view.” “Ah,” said the mother. “Thank you.” The tea picker nodded and then stepped back into the next row. The mother watched her move off, noticing the way the bushes shivered after she’d touched them. Just as the tea picker had said, there was a board. Shaky white letters on a piece of wood, an arrow pointing directly up. The path was steep, more like stairs, really, a near-vertical ascent with depressions in the dirt where she could secure her footing. She hefted the bag, feeling its contents jostle. She would probably be able to manage, but the climb would be easier without the burden. She pulled out a sandwich, slipped it into the pocket of her kurta, and looked around for a place to set the bag. Then she remembered having passed a tree whose roots had broken through the dirt. She turned back, her stride full of fresh purpose. Sure enough, two of the roots had joined to form a scaly chamber. She knelt and pushed the bag deep inside. She returned to the sign and began to climb. Leaning into the slope, she tried to make herself as compact as possible, staying close to the earth. Those old principles of gravity and equilibrium. Her body had always known them, even if her mind hadn’t. Her father on the veranda, inspecting her failed physics and math papers, eyebrows raised at each incorrect answer. And so: home economics. The losses and gains of vegetables, the partial return of chores. College, a year at the NGO, then marriage. Her body amazed her. It did not falter. She got to the top, panting. Her husband would have insisted on going up first to test the route. She would have had to climb with his face peering down at her with anxious encouragement, his hand stretched out imploringly. She looked down. Twenty feet at least. If she had fallen, no one would have caught her. A sprained ankle. A broken finger. A dislocated shoulder. She would have made her way in spite of it. She would have limped or crawled. Maybe a couple of the tea pickers would have come upon her, taken her back to their home. She would have leaned on one woman’s shoulder and hobbled along, her body knotted with pain, blazingly aware of that slim, strong tea hand wrapped around her waist. Lookout Point was a bar of dirt overlooking a valley, with a low metal guardrail that did not extend fully to either side. There was a wooden bench, peeling and splintered beyond use. A white car was parked next to it, and for a second, she thought her husband had come to find her. Then she saw a young couple standing together at the guardrail. The mother stopped. She had bargained on being alone, and she was tempted to duck and hide, but the man caught sight of her. “Hi there!” he called. “Isn’t this fantastic?” The woman saw her too, and waved. “It was overcast when we got here,” she said cheerfully, “but it’s clearing up now.” They both had accents. American-born. They were the same height and built along the same proportions: slender hips, narrow shoulders. They spoke with enthusiasm, as if they had been expecting her. But how could that be? She herself had not been expecting to be here. “Where’d you come from?” the man asked. “You kind of popped up out of nowhere. Meena thought it was a wild animal.” “I came from there,” the mother said, pointing. “There is a path.” The young woman laughed. “I’m a bit jumpy. We met this guy near our resort. He was crazy. Or drunk. I couldn’t tell. Anyway, he went on and on about this tiger that killed a kid somewhere here.” “A kid?” the mother echoed. “Oops,” the woman said. “Not a child. I meant a baby goat. Sorry.” She laughed. “Anyway, we asked at the resort, and it’s all nonsense. Apparently, he’s been telling the same story for years.” “Mentally unstable,” said the man. “A nutjob,” said the woman. The mother came over and stood beside them. After a moment of mutual inspection, the three of them looked out over the valley. The hills were blurred with clouds. A sparkling plate of water, a lake, lay at the bottom. The wind was coming up. She could feel their curiosity. A woman walking alone in the hills, no family, no explanation. She was a mystery to them. She was a story they would tell when they went back home. We met a strange woman, walking alone. She felt a sudden pride in that idea. “Do you think you’d be able to take a picture of us?” the man said. The camera he was holding out to her was compact and silver, nothing like her husband’s chunky Nikon. It sat snug in his palm like a deck of cards. She nodded, and they beamed. The couple posed in front of the guardrail, which reached only as high as their calves. “See if you can get that really tall hill in the background,” called the man. “Just let her take it, Akash,” the woman said. “He always has to control everything.” The man laughed, but the mother noticed his embarrassment. These small humiliations, she wanted to tell them, they will become the score of your life. The offhand remark, the neglected compliment, the forgotten item, the mixed-up ticket, the late arrival. They will be the things you pay attention to, and there will be no time for anything else. She held up the camera. “Move back a little,” she said. They kept their arms around each other’s waists while they shuffled back obediently. As if I’m holding a gun, the mother thought. “A little more,” she said. They complied. “I’m only getting your faces,” she said. “Can you move back a little more?” Their legs were now touching the guardrail. The mother felt the button of the camera hard under her finger. “A little more,” she said. “We’ll fall,” the woman said with a nervous laugh. “Why don’t you move back yourself?” The man spoke with slight aggression. “Then you can get more of the background.” Of course. The obvious solution. The mother stared at the couple. Her heart was beating inexplicably fast. She retreated and the entire valley leapt into the screen of the camera. She clicked. “Thank you,” the man said. He came forward and took the camera from her. The woman was friendly again, smiling. “It is so peaceful here,” she said. “I wish we could stay longer, but we have to see my relatives in Kerala. Akash only has a couple weeks off from work.” “We’re at Crown Resorts,” said the man. “How about you?” The mother considered her answer. “No,” she said at last. “No?” The man seemed to find her newly interesting. “I thought that was the only resort around here. Where are you staying?” She paused. “In a village,” she said. “I also have relatives.” They looked a bit puzzled but seemed to accept this. The woman, Meena, turned and gazed at the view one more time. “Beautiful,” she said. Then, “We should get back.” “Yes,” the man agreed. “Bye,” he said to the mother. “It’ll be a gorgeous sunset,” the woman added. “Yes,” the mother said. “I came to watch the sunset.” That was all it took, the simple statement of a purpose. They relaxed perceptibly. She was less of a mystery to them now. She was a woman who had come to watch the sunset. She wished she hadn’t said anything. She wished she’d left them to wonder. They got into their white car. The man reversed, then drove off in the direction of the resort. It seemed a very long time before they were fully out of sight. The young woman was wrong. It was not a gorgeous sunset. There were no fiery pinks and oranges. There was only an insipid flare before the sun dropped behind the hills. The mother swung her legs over the guardrail and sat on the edge. She took the sandwich from her pocket, a shapeless mess of bread and cheese. Unwrapping it from the thin plastic, she coaxed off a corner. She thought of the resort, the dining room, where there would be a menu and a waiter and a husband and a daughter and a thousand collisions to brace for. She chewed the bread slowly. The cheese was tart and made her teeth hurt. She swallowed and wished she had some water to wash it down. No matter. Her mouth filled slowly with saliva. Her body had always known what to do. I must go back, she thought. I must go back. But she remained where she was. Two hours later, the daughter woke up in cottage five. The day had grown dark. Her sheets were wet. Her underwear was wet. Had she urinated? Then she remembered her period. She jumped out of bed with a gasp and snatched at the sheet, which had a large, dark stain like a screaming mouth. She dragged the sheet to the bathroom and slammed the door. She filled a bucket with hot water and stuffed the bloodstained sheet into it. She tore off her shorts and underwear and stuffed those in, too. She squatted on the cold tiles, shivering, until she’d recovered herself, then she tiptoed out to get fresh clothes and a new pad, hoping that no one would come in. After she’d cleaned the evidence as best as she could, she went to find her father. He was sitting in the restaurant, watching a TV mounted on the wall. There was an empty glass in front of him, and a plate with the remnants of peanuts and shredded onions. “You’re awake,” he said. “Feeling better?” “Where’s Amma?” the daughter asked. “Do you want a Pepsi?” he asked. “No. Where’s Amma?” she asked again. “Walking,” her father said. He seemed very tired. “She’s still walking.” “Appa,” she said urgently. “What about the tiger?” Her father blinked. “The tiger,” she repeated. “That man told us about it, remember? What if Amma—” She broke off, unable to finish the thought. Her father’s face constricted with fear, then slackened. “Don’t be silly, baby. That man didn’t know what he was saying. There’s no tiger.” “But what if—” “You should be having fun,” he said in a complaining way. “That’s what this holiday is for. Why don’t you go and play table tennis, hm? Or go find the rabbit?” “But, Appa, what if—” All at once, he lurched to his feet. “Fine!” he shouted. “You want me to go look for her? Is that what you want? You want me to bring her back? Okay, I’ll go.” “She doesn’t even have a torch,” the daughter whispered, starting to feel ashamed of her outburst. She imagined her mother in their cottage later, sipping a cup of steaming tea, listening to the saga. You were afraid I’d been attacked by a tiger. And you thought your father would be able to save me—how exactly? By fighting it off with his bare hands?  “Doesn’t matter,” her father said illogically. “Torch or no torch, I’ll find her.” They made their way to the resort gates. “Stay here,” he ordered. “I don’t want you falling sick again.” He walked away up the road, more or less steady on his feet. At the fork, the daughter saw him pause. His head swiveled one way, then the other. Not knowing what else to do, she wandered over to the clubhouse. In the table-tennis room, the net had collapsed, and two paddles, their rubber surfaces peeling off, were lying one on top of the other. No balls were in sight. The room had the stripped air of a banquet hall after a feast has been cleared away. She walked to the far side and examined the unpainted cement walls. Then she heard a sound and spun to see the boy in the blue uniform, the one who had shown them to their cottage. He was holding a paddle in each hand, and he was looking at her. “Want to play?” he asked. “They’re bald,” she pointed out, meaning the paddles. “And there’s no ball.” “Okay.” He dropped the paddles onto the table with a clatter that made her wince. “What are you doing here if you don’t want to play?” he asked. She shrugged. “Nothing. What are you doing here?” “I’m off duty,” he said, and the phrase impressed her with its adult implications. “Where are your mother and father?” he asked. “In the cottage,” she said quickly. Young as she was, she knew how to be discreet. Then, to change the subject, she said, “Is the rabbit still here?” “Yes,” the boy answered quickly. “Want to go and play with it?” Her goal had been mere diversion, but she found that she suddenly did want to see the rabbit. She wanted to hold its soft body against her chest, to stroke its long ears. They left the clubhouse and crossed the garden to the hutch, which was simply a large, square enclosure of wire with a floor of hay. The daughter peered in. A white shape lay on the ground. “Is it the same one from last year?” “Yes,” the boy said. “Why?” “It looks different.” “It’s the same one.” He unlatched the gate. “Let’s go inside.” She wanted to refuse, but it was too late. She followed him into the hutch. Her foot knocked against a metal water bowl, in which floated several dead insects. Some water splashed out and she had to suppress a yelp of revulsion. They stood there together, looking down. “Aren’t you going to pick it up?” the boy asked. “What?” “The rabbit. You wanted to play with it. Aren’t you going to pick it up?” He watched her, arms crossed. There was no way to avoid it. She felt a surge of anger so great that she was sure she could kill him, if she only had a weapon. The rabbit looked wrong to her. It looked ugly. She bent and slipped her hands beneath its body. “Shh,” she said, trying to seem capable and comforting. She lifted it onto her chest, turning her face away from the hot stink of its fur. As though it had sensed her unwillingness, the rabbit began to squirm. “What are you doing?” The boy took a step toward her. “You’re holding it wrong.” “No,” she said. “I’ve got it. It’s fine.” He looked like he wanted to disagree, but he stopped where he was. “Shh,” the daughter told the rabbit. “Don’t worry. Shh. It’s okay.” But the animal kept scrabbling, tremors of fear rippling across its fur. She tightened her arms around its rib cage, which only intensified its struggle. “You’re hurting it,” the boy repeated. He took another step. This time he sounded angry. “No!” she cried. “It’s fine. Stay there.” But it was as though she hadn’t spoken; he kept coming. Just then, pain barbed through her hand. She looked down in amazement to find a bead of blood where the rabbit’s teeth had sunk in. The boy was so close. Any moment, his fingers would land on her skin. So she did the only thing she could think of, which was, in truth, all she had wanted to do from the beginning. She took a step back and threw the rabbit as hard as she could at him. For a second, she stood there, incredulous, watching it fly, watching the boy raising his arms, though whether to save the animal or to save himself, she could not tell. Then she ran."

        "year": "2022",
        "story": "Three days before opening night, the lead actress quits my play to do summer-stock theater in the Catskills. “Occupational hazard,” the director tells me, meaning this is what happens when no one’s getting paid for two weeks of rehearsal for one performance only in a basement on the Lower East Side that seats 40 on folding chairs. In other words, opening night is the same as closing night. Never mind that I’ve put my heart and soul into this play, that it’s taken me three years to finish the script, writing weeknights and weekends, and that in three more years I’ll be 35, which is when I plan to ask my boss if I might be promoted from my permanent position as full-time temp. He’ll say, “I thought you wanted to be a playwright.” Indeed, this is my fifth play (not counting the bad ones I wrote in college). And to make matters worse, I was the one who’d insisted on casting the actress in the lead role, against the better judgment of my director, and solely for sentimental reasons: because she reminded me of my mom, blue eyes, etc., and my mom’s been dead for almost a year. She’d been my biggest fan, single mother that she was, coming to all my productions, starting when I was a little boy, back when I wasn’t thinking about that thing called career, putting on plays in the living room in front of an audience of one who gave me a standing ovation every time. “Bravo, Billy,” she’d say. She’d hug and put me on her lap. “One day you’re going to be on Broadway.” Now I’m sitting in the back row of a sweltering theater with 40 seats and no AC, listening as the audience chuckles along to my two-act about two couples on a beach chatting about themes of life and love. Apparently, no one’s able to tell that the lead actress has rehearsed only twice. The play is light—witty banter, pleasing setting, happy ending, box-office appeal—but it’s while everyone is exiting the theater post-performance, shaking my sweaty hand hard, congratulating me, saying all the right things, beaming with the glow of a comedy that has not taxed them, making me think that there’s still some hope for my so-called career after all, that I’m surprised to see the original actress standing in front of me. Doubly shocking because of how closely she resembles my mother. We smile at each other warmly, solicitously, even though I thought she was supposed to be in the Catskills doing summer stock. For a moment I think I might sob on her shoulder from this strange, ghostlike encounter. Then she asks me, point-blank, if I’d ever considered how white my play is. In fact how white all my plays are, and also how middle-class. “Have you ever considered that?” she asks. She happens to be white and middle-class too, so the question almost seems like a contradiction—or at least unfair. “It’s about themes of life and love,” I say. I’m confused. I’m flustered. “I’m not talking about themes,” she says, “I’m talking about sensibility.” I want a second opinion, but most of the audience has already left, and they’d been white too, and none of them had been producers. Six weeks later, I’m staring at an empty computer screen, weeknights and weekends. Whenever someone asks me what I’m working on, I tell them, “I’m in the thick of it,” which on some level is true. But I’m bereft of inspiration and insight, wallowing in artistic self-pity and theatrical bitterness. It doesn’t help that this is right around the time when Hamilton is beginning its ascension, breaking every Broadway box-office record along the way. Nor does it help that I’d known Lin-Manuel Miranda, mostly from a distance, having traveled in the same circles when we were both nobodies. As for his musical, I don’t plan to see it, but I have managed to track down a few disparaging reviews online—not easy to find—to confirm what I already suspected (“sophomoric,” “pandering,” “inaccurate,”), and I’ve listened to the cast album three times. Somehow I know that the actress was right about my work, and what I really need to do, if there’s any chance of rescuing my playwriting soul, is create my own “unflinching portrait of America”—my future review for my play while sitting at my desk late at night. But if I have something of significance to say, I don’t know what it is, and I don’t know where to find it, until one afternoon, about four months into my commercial and critical funk, with my computer blank and my brain running on empty, the pendulum of artistic sensibility finally swings, and it swings all the way over to Malcolm X. Here is a figure as far from a beach scene as one can get. Here is big drama, high stakes, no whites, except for a high-school teacher who told him that he should give up his dream of being a lawyer and become a carpenter instead. This I’ve gleaned from Wikipedia, along with references to Pan-Africanism, Hinton Johnson, and everything else I’d never known about Malcolm X. Two weeks later, I’ve written 20 pages of a two-act with a tragic ending. No one in the audience will be chuckling this time. And two weeks later, I’ve written another 20 pages. And then after that, I do what every playwright does: I procrastinate. I tell myself that it’s play-related, and I really should spend an afternoon taking photographs on the sidewalk outside the former Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, because no historical play would be complete without some fieldwork. And I also should really spend a Saturday—maybe two—at the Schomburg Center, located aptly on Malcolm X Boulevard, digging deep into the library archives, white interloper that I am, come to learn from African American newspapers of the 1960s about how much my high-school history classes sugarcoated the past. Late to the game, I’m undertaking a crash course on Jim Crow, augmented by Malcolm X’s commentary running through my mind, courtesy of 15 hours of YouTube videos, reminding me that this isn’t the past I’m learning about. It’s the present. “The white man is afraid of truth, Billy,” I hear him saying in his matter-of-fact tone, firm and patient, measured and gentle, implicating me straight to my face. Yes, I know that, Malcolm, but please try to understand how far away this truth has always been for me, how as a little boy I watched the L.A. riots on my Upper West Side television set, in my prewar doorman building, sitting on my mother’s lap, five days, 63 dead, and my mother shaking her head, saying, “It’s a shame what they did to that man, Billy”—she was referring to Reginald Denny—and the reporters saying that as bad as it was, it was still only the second-worst riot in American history. But I don’t recall anyone ever bothering to tell us what the worst one had been. And once my fieldwork has been satisfied, I decide that what I really need to do next, before getting back to actually writing my play, is read The Autobiography of Malcolm X, which I should have already read, of course, 500 pages of a primary source, with its blockbuster opening line, as straightforward and chilling as any in American literature: “When my mother was pregnant with me, she told me later, a party of hooded Ku Klux Klan riders galloped up to our home in Omaha, Nebraska, one night.” And while I’m reading, I’m taking on extra shifts as a temp, because you can’t be a playwright if you can’t pay the bills. Now when asked what I’m working on, I say, “I’m working 60 hours a week.” I’m also deep-cleaning my apartment, on my hands and knees, scrubbing the baseboards, 40 pages of an unfinished play staring down at me, the weeks piling up, middle age approaching, which is when it occurs to me that what I really should have been doing, before having done anything else—Schomburg, Audubon, Autobiography—is emptying out my mother’s storage unit. By now she’s been dead nearly two years. Her illness was brief, unexpected, and sad, after less than a week on hospice, lying in our living room with an oxygen tank in the corner and the sconces on the wall turned low, the same living room where I’d once put on my plays for her. But this time the drama was immediate and true, unfolding in front of us in real time, almost entirely in silence. I would sit beside her for long stretches, staring at the side of her face, all pallor and cheekbones, while I spoon-fed her bite-size pieces of dinner that required concentration for her to chew and swallow. Occasionally she would become energized; she’d squeeze my hand, she’d speak with gusto, her blue eyes wide, her personality returning to keep death at bay. She didn’t want dinner, she wanted dessert. She didn’t want water, she wanted root beer. “I want A&W, Billy,” she’d say, her voice firm. Back and forth to the corner store I’d go, sometimes past midnight, and the doorman from my childhood, dressed like a pallbearer, would hold the front door for me each time with what felt like increasing solemnity. When I reentered the apartment, I would brace myself to find my mother gone, but she’d be sitting upright and annoyed, adjusting her hospital bed in half-inch increments, as if she were trying to get her car out of a snowdrift. “I want Ben & Jerry’s,” she’d say. I sold her furniture on Craigslist and put everything else into a Manhattan Mini Storage. If anything was worth saving, I told myself, I’d figure it out later. But I’d never visited until now, and here I am in a space the size of a home office, surrounded by cardboard boxes, stacked floor to ceiling, each one labeled by the moving company, bathroom, kitchen, as if this were temporary quarters for a tenant between homes. The architectural ethos of the Manhattan Mini Storage only adds to the feeling of corporeal limbo, with its long white hallways and morguelike setting, its padlocked doors, its linoleum muffling my footsteps. Suddenly I understand what I should have understood from the outset, that I’m embarking with my mother on the final stage of our journey together, a painstaking and emotional reckoning by way of six decades’ worth of cherished objects. No, I haven’t been procrastinating over a play about Malcolm X—it’s the opposite: The play about Malcolm X has been my way of avoiding my mother’s storage unit. But the first box I open contains six umbrellas and a plastic bag filled with other plastic bags. I had told the moving company to pack everything, and now I’m being confronted by the reality of such an overzealous directive, which, to the movers’ credit, they appear to have followed to the letter. In the next box I find a dozen floppy disks, a wall-mount pencil sharpener, and an assortment of other obsolete office supplies. So it goes. She had saved everything, it seems. She had discarded nothing. I’ve spent $400 a month storing the detritus of my mother’s life. Yet if she’d kept anything of nostalgic value, I can’t find it. If she’d kept the postcards I’d sent her once a week from college, I can’t find those either. Ten cardboard boxes later, you’d be forgiven for thinking she’d never had a son. And never had a life beyond the one I’d known. What I had assumed would be a heartfelt endeavor that would conclude with me crying on the floor of the mini storage is mostly a tedious treasure hunt to nowhere. Where are the daily planners, the diaries, the keepsakes, the heirlooms? Where is the box labeled memorabilia? Once in a while I get lucky and come across something of possible interest, like a gently worn brooch in a pile of dinnerware, but I have no way of discerning whether what I’ve discovered is a beloved item or simply cheap and quotidian. Just like I don’t know what to make of the random undated photos of relatives I’ve never met, not a one, standing together in front of an apartment building on the Lower East Side, pale, cold, working-class, strangers to me all, with the exception of my mother, whom I scarcely recognize as a little girl. She’s wearing a blue dress in the photo, and she’s smiling at the camera, lips no teeth, but the blue dress is too big for her, and it’s a little bit shabby, and she doesn’t look very happy. I remember that once for her birthday she’d planned for us to do something special to celebrate, a fun afternoon in the city together, pizza and a movie, but I’d been recalcitrant for some reason, and I hadn’t wanted to see the movie she’d wanted to see, a rom-com with Julia Roberts, and she hadn’t wanted to see what I’d wanted to see, an animated version of Hercules, and finally we’d agreed to split the difference and watch Good Will Hunting, which, when I wasn’t confused, I was mostly bored. “It’s about a young person’s aspirations,” she’d said afterward, the two of us walking the streets of late-afternoon New York, while she tried her best to explain to me what had clearly gone over my head. Perhaps I had been feeling condescended to, because I’d blurted out, inexplicably, “You’re the one who’s stupid.” “That’s not nice, Billy,” she’d said. She was trying to put on a brave face, and her crestfallen expression had been excruciating for me. I could see that I’d hurt her feelings on her special day, but I could not bring myself to apologize. We had walked for a long time, saying nothing, light fading, until we were standing in front of that same Lower East Side apartment building from the photo, gazing up at a run-of-the-mill four-story tenement that was distinguished only by the bakery on the ground floor selling high-end muffins, which I’d hoped my mother might buy for us. She had stood there for a while, brooding, staring at the brick wall, shrouded in long shadows, and then she’d said, “Gentrification, Billy.” By the time midnight arrives at Manhattan Mini Storage, I’m encircled by 100 upturned boxes, my hands smelling of cardboard, wondering if I would have been better off scrutinizing the contents of the pencil sharpener for keys to a past that’s seemingly been erased. My mother had been raised Catholic, but other than a Bible and a rosary, I find no Catholic traces anywhere. Nor had we ever had any in our lives, she and I, no church, no Easter, no last rites in the living room on her hospital bed. Come to think of it, we’d had no Irish either, despite her being fifth-generation. The only Irish I’d ever experienced was the time she took me to the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade, four hours on Fifth Avenue in a March drizzle, watching leprechauns pass by on green floats. “Cultural stereotypes, Billy,” she’d said. She never talked about her past, and I never thought to ask, and now I’m going to have to spend the rest of my life trying to make sense out of a pile of disparate trinkets, tchotchkes, ephemera, less than 1 percent of the total haul, not even enough to fill one of my mother’s plastic bags, the last remains of a history that has slowly faded over the generations. Never mind a play about Malcolm X. I don’t know anything about myself. And so the next time the pendulum of artistic sensibility swings, it swings even wider. It swings all the way to the 19th century, New York City, the middle of the Civil War. Here’s even bigger drama, higher stakes, no beach scenes. Instead, tenement scenes—from the inside looking out. Now when someone asks me what I’m working on, I tell them, “I’m in the thick of it,” which is an understatement. The writing is laborious and slow-going, each line of dialogue necessitating, on average, 10 minutes of research in the never-ending pursuit of historical accuracy. I’m undertaking a crash course on Irish immigration, courtesy of more time spent on Wikipedia, clicking from hyperlink to hyperlink, each entry as distressing as the next, beginning with the potato famine, seven years, 1 million Irish dead, thanks to the British, and another million fleeing the country, many on the “coffin ships,” arriving in America—if they’re not among the 30 percent who die en route—three months later, where they cram into the Lower East Side (pre-gentrification), living in poverty, working for starvation wages, and enduring discrimination for being both Irish and Catholic. Somewhere deep within my DNA lies the molecular imprint of this history, affecting me I know not how in the 21st century. The first character I create is Billy, of course, a.k.a. me, and the second character is my mom, resurrecting her and putting her back in her childhood apartment on Mulberry Street, where the two of us can be together again (albeit 150 years ago). When the lights rise, Act I, Scene i, I have her standing center stage, wearing a dress—a blue dress—not unlike the blue dress from that photo I’d found of her as a little girl, except now she’s an adult, and she’s made the dress out of scraps from the uniforms she’s been sewing all day for the Union soldiers going off to fight. It’s piecemeal work, low-paying, and she has to buy the spools of thread at 10 cents each. She’s supporting the war effort, yes, but she’s against the war. This is only the first of many contradictions. “Do I look beautiful?” she’s asking me, twirling around in the winter sunlight that’s coming through the lone window facing the tenement that shares the outdoor bathroom where the typhus comes from. No, we’re not on the Upper West Side anymore, Mom and I, and we’re not in the middle class either. We’re also not white, which comes as shocking news to 21st-century me. According to Wikipedia, we’re considered the “missing link,” that final evolutionary stage between ape and human, biologically closer to the African than to the white man, what with our prognathous jaws and facial angles—all of this scientifically indisputable, and completely obvious to 19th-century me once I stare at my reflection long enough in the tenement window. To the long list of oppression that I would have been contending with—poverty, discrimination, joblessness—I can now add body dysmorphia. And so when my mom turns and asks me, “Do I look beautiful?,” the truth, as she most certainly would have already suspected, was, “No, Ma, you don’t look beautiful.” The xenophobia comes from without, sure, but it’s also within. Two months later, I’m still tinkering with the first scene, refining facts, increasing drama, me and Mom getting on each other’s nerves in a 300-square-foot apartment without heat. I’m unemployed and I’ve been home all day in the tenement. I was home all day yesterday, too. Last winter, I worked six weeks in a row digging ditches in Central Park, which is what passes for a good job at $1 a day. Now no one’s hiring the Irish, not even on the docks. Irish need not apply read the signs I see on Wikipedia. My mom keeps telling me that I should ask Boss Tweed, that Boss Tweed will help me find something, as if Boss Tweed is a close personal friend. But we both know that if the slaves are freed, they’ll head straight to Manhattan, all 4 million of them, and then I really won’t be able to find a job. There’s not going to be any procrastination with the play this time. This time I’m writing straight through to the end, nonstop, unless you count watching 17 hours of Ric Burns’s documentary miniseries on New York City as procrastination, which I don’t. Or his brother Ken’s miniseries on the Civil War, which I also don’t. They’re interested not only in the broad strokes of history, people writ large, but also in the small stories, sons, moms, slow pans, fiddle music. When I finally nod off, it’s to sweet dreams of Broadway dancing in my head. But then one day, about a year after I began writing the script, the pages piling up in my desktop printer, and with just a few more scenes of personal and societal hardship to go, I make the mistake of clicking one Wikipedia hyperlink too many, which takes me to an entry with the somewhat inscrutable heading “Draft Riots.” Up to now, this would not have been all that remarkable, given the countless riots against the Irish: the Gordon Riots, the Bible Riots, the Know-Nothing Riots. They are many, they are brutal, and they span continents. But none of these had ever felt germane enough to include in my play, except as a possible aside from an ancillary character, a street sweeper perhaps, quickly checking the box of historical veracity and moving on. What I’m reading about now, however, is unlike anything I’ve read about before. In front of me, glowing on my computer screen in a no-nonsense font, are those very riots that I had heard about way back in 1992, while sitting on my mother’s lap in the living room, listening as the reporters mentioned, in passing, that the violence in L.A., as immense as it might be, was the second-worst riot in American history. As for the worst, the place had been New York City, the time had been 1863, and the rioters had been the Irish, who had destroyed the city—arson, looting, beating, murder—and the police had been unable to stop them, because the police were being beaten too. The further I scroll, the worse it gets, four days long, with the crowning emblem of brutality being the burning to the ground of the Colored Orphan Asylum, on Fifth Avenue. Suddenly I’m no longer the oppressed, but I’m the oppressor too. And I recall that quote from Sophocles, that I had first learned in college, but never fully understood, and yet retained all these years for some reason. “Who is the slayer,” he had asked, “who is the victim?” I’ve lived my entire life in New York City, but if I’ve ever passed a memorial dedicated to the event, I don’t remember it. If I’ve ever seen a plaque for the Black man who’d been lynched on Clarkson Street, in the West Village, I don’t remember that either. Nor do I remember ever learning that the first draft in American history had been ordered by Lincoln during the Civil War, but with one significant caveat: You could exempt yourself by paying $300 or by hiring a substitute to fight in your place. In other words, only the poor were conscripted, and in New York City in 1863, nearly a quarter of the population. This was the barefaced injustice that had set the most destructive riot in American history in motion, but if I had been taught about any of that in my high school history class, I must not have been paying attention. Neither apparently had my director, whom I’m meeting at a Starbucks in Midtown to discuss the play for the first time, six months of grueling rewrites later, weeknights and weekends. We’re sitting across from each other, and the finished script sits between us on the table, 100 pages that I’ve poured my heart into, and upon which she has casually rested her coffee cup. Both of us are in business-casual attire and sensible shoes, because we’re on our lunch break from our respective day jobs, and we make self-conscious theatrical small talk for a while to avoid the matter at hand. Have you seen this play? Have you seen that play? Finally, the director takes a big, bracing sip from her coffee cup, places it back down on the top of my script, foam on her lips, and says, “You’ve got yourself another Hamilton.”  She means an unflinching portrait of America, sans music, of course. I’m so caught off guard, so overcome with gratitude, that I fear I might sob.  “Have you seen Hamilton?” she asks me. “No,” I say, “but I’ve always wanted to.” “You should,” she says. “I will!” I say. She goes on, effusively, telling me how she read my play in one sitting, how she then read it again. “I read it with a pencil in my hand,” she says, “and I didn’t make one suggestion.” She’s talking about scope, she’s talking about sensibility. She’s talking about the scene in which Billy can’t get a job as a longshoreman because he’s Irish, and the scene in which he can’t get a job at the Novelty Iron Works, and the scene in which the textile merchant offers him $300 to fight in his place. “So unjust,” she says. I’m waiting for more accolades, but we’re short on time, 10 minutes left to be exact, and as we sip our lukewarm coffee she says, before she forgets, that she does have a few minor comments, specifically about the character of Billy, minor things really, mostly concerning his transformation at the end of the play, from mild-mannered mama’s boy to enraged, prognathous-jawed grown man running shirtless through the streets of New York City, one of thousands, fueled by a lifetime of self-loathing and humiliation, terrified of being sent to a war against his will, an unapologetic participant in the violence from start to finish, beating, burning, looting all the way to the last scene, when he turns down Clarkson Street. “Are you sure you want your protagonist to be an antihero?” she asks me, which is another way of saying unlikable. “I’m just trying to consider it from all angles,” she says, but mainly she’s trying to consider it from the angle of the audience, who, according to her, won’t be rooting for Billy, personal injustices notwithstanding. She’s thinking long-term, she’s thinking box-office appeal, she’s thinking about a future outside the basement theater. I appreciate this. After all, she says, if the audience isn’t happy, the producer won’t be either. By the way, she knows someone who knows a producer who might be interested. I appreciate this, too. “It’s in my DNA,” I tell her. I’m referring to victim and slayer. “DNA?” she says. “Antigone,” I say. “I haven’t seen it,” she says. “You should,” I say. “It won’t take much rewriting,” she says. What’s one more rewrite, when you’ve already done a thousand? “What’s one more swing of the artistic pendulum?” I say. “Pendulum?” she says. Her coffee cup has left a big circular ring on my script. “I’ll think about it,” I tell her, and I mean it, because I can see her point, but mostly because I can see the fork in the road of my theater career, where one path leads through the streets of Midtown to my temp job, finally giving my boss two-weeks notice. He’ll say, “I always knew you were going to be a playwright.” But I can also hear the soundtrack of Malcolm X’s voice, still running through my head from all those hours of YouTube videos, telling me, “Billy, I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he’s wrong, than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil.” No, Malcolm, don’t worry, I’m not going to sugarcoat the past. Never mind Billy’s unlikability. Never mind Billy ever making it to Broadway. Now is not the time to flinch. Besides, the real problem with the script, as far as I’m concerned, is that I’ve bitten off way more than the basement theater can chew. Because it’s one thing to write a play while sitting in your apartment staring at your computer screen, and it’s another thing to stage a play, and I can see, before the first rehearsal has even begun, that I’ve created a world that’s going to be wholly impossible to convey. Here we all are, a cast of 20, plus the director and me, gathered together in a room with 40 seats, 12 fluorescent lights, and zero budget. There’s not going to be a tenement or a blue dress or spools of thread at 10 cents each. I’m going to be entirely dependent, as I have been throughout my entire so-called career, on the ability of the actors to bring to life what’s nonexistent—sets, props, everything—and on the audience to fill in the rest of the blanks. But laying a towel down on a stage and declaring it a beach is not the same as trying to portray a society from the bottom up. “You need three things in the theater,” went the famous maxim that I had learned in college: “the play, the actors, and the audience, and each must give something.” It had seemed profound to me at the time, and also irrelevant, given that we had a 400-seat theater and tuition dollars to spare on production. Now I need the maxim more than ever. “I love your play,” the actors tell me, one after the other, mouths half-full with first-rehearsal muffins that I’ve paid for. They know people who know producers. They use their yellow highlighters to write down phone numbers on my script along with smiley faces of optimism. I have the feeling that the actors, at least the lesser ones, are angling for bigger roles if anyone quits for something that pays in the Catskills. If so, they’re doing a good job. But no one’s going to be quitting this time. No, this time they’re all in for two weeks of rehearsals for one performance in the basement. The second problem I have is that I don’t appreciate the actor who’s playing me. Lying in bed at night, I’d let myself imagine which leading man would be cast as Billy, starting with Bradley Cooper. Instead, the director has decided on a balding, heavyset, blue-eyed, blond-haired replica of myself. “He studied at Juilliard,” she tells me. “I hope so,” I say. “I love your play,” he says, crumbs on his face. I want to ask him how many muffins he’s already eaten. As for the actress who’s been cast as my mom, she doesn’t look anything like her, which is probably for the best. She’s taller, she’s thinner, she’s 22 playing 42. So in addition to everything else, the audience is going to have to fill in the blanks of age. She’s brought with her a dictionary of the Civil War, which impresses me. She’s never heard of the Draft Riots either. “I never paid attention in high school,” she says. This turns out to be the perfect icebreaker for rehearsal No. 1, and the actors go around introducing themselves, each one saying who they are, what part they’re playing, and how this history is news to them. I’m beginning to see the results of my hard work—all those hyperlinks, all those rewrites—sitting before me in the flesh. There’s Horace Greeley, white, the founder of the New York Daily Tribune, which will be set on fire; and James McCune Smith, Black, the owner of a pharmacy on West Broadway, which will also be set on fire; and Officer John Alexander Kennedy, white, who will be caught on 46th Street and beaten nearly to death; plus the merchants, the tycoons, the abolitionists, hiding in their homes, praying that the rioters pass by. And there are the maids, the prostitutes, the rag pickers, all with their myriad contradictions and allegiances. Every person here is based on fact, but no one is just a person; they are types—except my mom and I, of course—in the spirit of Brecht’s epic theatre, which I’d studied in college, and in which every emotion manifests itself as a set of social relations. Or was it commedia dell’arte? Whatever the case, everyone is a fantastic actor, and that’s all that really matters when it comes down to it, and the play right now is exactly how I’d envisioned it, budget or no budget, fluorescent lights rising on the actress, 20 years too young for the role, but so what, she’s every version of my mom, today, yesterday, yesteryear, Act I, Scene i, standing center stage, twirling in that blue dress of hers that she’s made by hand. Who cares that it’s just a first rehearsal with no audience? I don’t need an audience. I’m an audience of one. It’s winter. It’s war. She’s staring at me with those blue eyes of hers. Come to think of it, maybe my mom and I were only ever types, too. “Do I look beautiful?” she asks me."

        "story": "How she used to smoke in his office, back when the University allowed that in campus buildings. He didn’t smoke, but allowed her to as she sat on the sofa across from his desk. Or rather, he didn’t object, and even set out a little dessert plate as an ashtray. Maybe because it gave them both a pretense for talking longer, for the extra duration of a cigarette, then two, then three. So that by the time she graduated, she was a chain-smoker. She had taken several of his courses, mostly on cinema. She’d read the assigned Gombrich texts, studied the Muybridge prints, wrote a paper on close-ups of Falconetti’s face. After class, she would drop by his office hours to continue class discussion. “Let’s hear it” was the first thing he’d say when she arrived. During her junior year, they would talk for an hour every week. Their conversations began to drag over time, usually when he started pontificating about how he’d never intended to be a career academic. Though flattered that he confided in her, she grew a little bored. He had the dream job of watching movies and writing about them. He was both an involved mentor who frequently elicited her opinions, and a ragged, pacing animal, sour about where he had ended up in life. Once, she offhandedly mentioned that she was tired and sleep-deprived. “So go home then,” he snapped. Taken aback, she explained that she didn’t have enough time to go home before her next class. “You can take a nap,” he said, and offered to leave his office so she could sleep on the sofa. “I’ll take these papers to grade and go downstairs to Holy Grounds,” he said, referring to the basement coffee shop in Godspeed Hall. Except when she lay down, he didn’t leave. Maybe she’d already known he wouldn’t. He remained behind his desk, and the sound of pages turning, the quick swipes of the pen as he scrawled devastating comments on students’ papers, served as the white noise that lulled her to sleep. She thought of his pen scrawling over her body, its sharp razor-point tip marking her with corrective feedback in corrosive industrial ink. When she awoke, he already had his coat on. “Okay?” he asked as she sat up. “Okay,” she said, a little embarrassed. “Was I asleep for long?” “No, not at all,” he said. “But office hours end in two minutes.” She wanted to be the object of his gaze, if only with her eyes closed, a little longer. She liked being warmed by his interest without ever yielding to it. The naps began to occur often enough to set a precedent. The rust-colored sofa was mushy but comfortable. After a while, she no longer felt self-conscious about languishing in the amnion of his office. When she woke up, he would say, “Okay?” and she would reply, “Okay,” and leave. It was a drafty office. Wind whistled through the walls. Leaving Godspeed Hall, she would bury her face in the collar of her coat, redolent of a tangy pine as she walked across campus on those dark winter afternoons. There was no sofa in her apartment, no bed. She slept on an inflatable mattress, reinforced nightly with a bike pump. Her parents had re-mortgaged their house to afford her private-college tuition, and she didn’t ask for more. From her wages shelving books at the library, she subsisted on spaghetti and apples, supplemented by appetizer spreads laid out at English Department receptions. After lectures on the decline of the novel, the failures of empire, she pilfered smoked salmon, soft cheeses, caviar garnishes. On weekends, there was usually a party where she helped herself to the snacks. The last time she remembered seeing the Professor was after leaving such a party, a few weeks before graduation. She’d been standing on a street corner late at night, waiting for a ride in the rain. He’d been walking his dog near campus. “I like your dog, Professor,” she had called out. It was an excessive, girthful Bernese mix. “Oh, good,” he said as he neared. “My dog is your dog.” “Oh, good. I was about to clone it. What’s its name?” “Nemo.” “Hi, Nemo! Nemo, did you know that your name means ‘no one’? I’m sorry!” The dog withstood her overzealous petting with dignity. “Do you have a strategy for getting home?” “Yes.” She didn’t mention that she had been waiting for “the drunk van,” a weekend campus service that deposited inebriated students at home. He studied her, then pointed across the street, at Godspeed Hall. “That’s my office.” “I know.” Though actually she hadn’t known. Her surroundings suddenly reoriented around her: She had been standing on the wrong corner for pickup. “If you’d like to dry off, you’re welcome to it. I could give you the keys. I won’t be in until Monday.” “I’m fine.” She smiled. “I see.” He hesitated. “You’re graduating in two weeks. What’s next after this?” “I don’t know.” On the other side of graduation was her actual life, the slow narrowing of possibilities that would catch her and freeze her in a vocation, a relationship, a life. She intended to avoid that slow calcification—if only by refraining from making any crucial decisions. In other words, she was moving back home. “I want your job one day.” Maybe she was saying it just to see his response. “You can have it. This is my last year.” “You’re retiring?” The surprise of this news sobered her a little. “I’ve probably overstayed. Once you’re tenured, you never leave.” Nemo tugged on his leash, but the Professor did not move. “The gap between you and your students widens. You get older, while they stay the same age, year after year. Like vampires.” “Doesn’t sound that bad to me.” She did not know what to say. He was not happy. He was just a person. “I’ve really enjoyed your classes, Professor.” She wanted to add more. How watching long films in the campus screening room, as they did in his class, made the midwestern winters bearable; how she appreciated that, unlike other faculty, he never wielded his knowledge as a weapon against his students. “The sanest way forward—you have to learn how to split yourself up, like an earthworm.” She did not know what he was talking about. “Anyway. I think Nemo is getting restless. I should be on my way.” He nodded at her. “Get home safe. And if I don’t see you before graduation, stay out of trouble.” She watched as the Professor walked across the street with Nemo. They ambled through the quad, then into the building that housed his office. It was almost three in the morning, but she reminded herself that she didn’t know him well. She had just been his student, a vampire. Whatever he was doing, it was really none of her business. Her default position was that of a dog fighting its way out of a corner. For much of her adult life, she had assumed this defensive crouch, tensed to prove herself against all odds at all times. She lacked the assurance, like many of her peers, that if one thing didn’t work out, there would always be something else. Maybe this desperation had helped drive her onto the tenure track, doggedly persisting through a complicated gantlet of grad school and postdocs and fellowships until she finally found herself gainfully employed as an assistant Professor at her college alma mater, where the fights were imperceptible because everyone had too much to lose and there was no corner. The Film and Media Studies faculty holiday party was held in a circular brick tower. She sipped rosé next to the window, a heavy wool coat over her other arm as if she were ready to leave. Surveying the event space, she did the usual reconnaissance: There was the one who bludgeoned her with compliments, the one who cut her off mid-sentence, the one who leaned in too closely and asked, in a hushed, solemn tone, how she was doing, as if only they could be the facilitator of her feelings. This dance of feigned, unearned intimacies played on endlessly at every meeting. Anyway. She was showing her face. She was engaging. And Carolyn was half-heartedly feting her. “Hey, before I forget. To your book,” Carolyn said, raising her glass and clinking it against hers. “Will you sign my copy later?” Without waiting for a response, she continued, “You must be so busy after your book release. I’m sure you’re just being heaped with accolades.” “Oh, I’m just glad it’s done.” Marie’s book, on cinema of “the face,” had been released by a university press at the beginning of the semester. Carolyn leaned in meaningfully. “How are you feeling about that?” She wasn’t entirely sure what the question was. “It always takes longer than you think.” She cleared her throat. “Do you have any interesting plans for holiday break?” “We’re taking the kids to the Adirondacks. We all need the detox, you know?” Carolyn waved her jittery hands, glistening with rings. “It’s crazy how busy things get. I’m serving on, like, 10 committees.” She looked at Marie curiously. “Ladies.” Sean approached, placing his hands on both their backs. He was her least favorite. “I presume you’re teaching next semester.” Carolyn and Marie nodded in unison. “And I presume these courses have titles.” Sean looked at Marie. He didn’t ask her questions so much as issue statements that she could confirm or refute. “Well, one course is called ‘The Disappearing Woman,’” Marie said. “We start with the genre of women’s films, then we look at contemporary heroines. You know, Vertigo, L’Avventura …” He sipped his wine, glanced around the room. “Oh, that’s fun.” He waved at the program chair across the room. She couldn’t tell if he was pretending, this nonchalance. “So I assume the woman always disappears by the end.” “The course title should come with a spoiler alert.” She too sipped her drink. “You know, I’ve found in my experience that students respond best to genre surveys rather than courses built around a theme.” “Depends on the syllabus, I’m sure,” she said benignly. He hadn’t been teaching at the University much longer than she had. She turned to Carolyn. “What are you teaching this spring, Carolyn?” “An introductory survey of silent film.” Carolyn shifted warily. “Anyway, I have to run. I promised the sitter I wouldn’t be late tonight.” Sean ignored Carolyn’s retreat. “I would take a look at some of the course listings from years past to give you the right idea of what works best.” “I have, but thanks.” Marie looked around the room, scanning it for reasons to excuse herself. Colleagues encircled one another, then broke apart periodically to form new groups. This was when she spotted the Professor, speaking with someone across the room. He looked, for lack of more elegant descriptors, frail and decrepit. She hadn’t seen him in maybe 15 years, not since college. On cue, he looked up and caught her gaze. The Professor wanted to see his old office, which was now her office. They walked across the dimly lit quads in the snow. He walked with a cane, and hid his winces with every step. He was speaking to her as if they were picking up mid-conversation after more than a decade. “I’m very ill. The treatments aren’t working.” “Is it serious?” she asked, knowing well that at his age, all illnesses were serious. “It’s terminal,” he said matter-of-factly. “I don’t have long, though there are differing opinions about what that means.” “I’m sorry.” Her pat response sounded so trivial. They continued on to Godspeed Hall in silence. When she opened the door to her office and switched on the fluorescent lights, he looked around at the now-bare walls and new plywood furnishings, the empty bookcases, the mini fridge in the corner. She wanted to apologize for not having properly made the space her own. “It’s mostly just for meeting with students.” She preferred to do her scholarly work at home. “Would you like tea or something?” He didn’t respond at first. “I would like you to keep an open mind.” He studied the closet behind her desk. Then he opened the door, revealing an old armoire that had always been there. She watched as he struggled to move it. “Here, let me help you,” she said. But he had already slid it to the edge of the closet. From the drag marks in the floorboards, it had been moved many times. “There.” He was satisfied. “Now turn on the light, please.” When she pulled the dangling bulb’s drawstring, the light revealed a hole in the wall, which she had never noticed before. It was large enough that a person could easily enter it. He stepped through the hole until he was almost fully submerged. She took a step forward, then back. Sensing her hesitation, he turned around. “Okay?” “Okay.” As if in a dream, she followed him. On the other side is where the story begins. The passageway led outside. She looked around as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. To their left, a cloister of coniferous trees, swaying in the breeze. It had stopped snowing. Or, actually, there was no snow on the ground at all. It was not even cold. The air felt soft and supple. It was almost warm, as if it were a summer’s night. Or maybe it was a summer’s night, somewhere. She said, “I have never been to this part of campus before.” And then waited for him to correct her. They were not on campus, or even near it. “I used to come out here when I had your office.” He was still looking around. There was a full moon in the sky, the only source of light. It illuminated what looked like a country road receding into the distance. She wanted to take off her coat, but to do so would have been to accept the reality of her surroundings. “Where are we?” He pointed to a pine tree some yards away. “Do you see that cup over there? On the ground?” She squinted. There was a white paper cup at its base. “It’s a cup of coffee. Can you take a look?” She walked over to the tree and picked up the Solo cup, filled with fresh coffee, lightened with cream. “Is it still warm?” “Yes.” She brought it to him, but he didn’t bother to examine it. “What if I told you I left it there years ago, on my last day before retirement?” “But it’s still warm.” Heat emanated from the cup. “Yes, that’s my point.” He paused. “What I can tell you is that I have visited this place hundreds of times. It is always night here. The weather is always the same, warm and temperate.” She studied the coffee cup in her hand. The paper sleeve was imprinted with the logo of Holy Grounds, which had closed years ago. She looked around again, studied the space. “Where does that road go?” she asked, gesturing to the two-lane freeway. “I don’t know. I’ve never seen a single car on it. I used to have questions too. But eventually I found I was able to enjoy this place without any answers.” He was looking at the sky, the full moon. “It’s always the same.” She set the cup down in the grass. “Why did you show this to me?” she asked. When he didn’t answer, she repeated the question. It was only after the Professor had passed, during holiday break, that she entered the passageway again. The University memorial service, scheduled shortly after New Year’s, was held in the same circular-tower room as the faculty holiday party. She had not expected the body to be on view, half the casket opened to expose his closed face, pale and frowning. Something he had said once in a lecture: “It is in the most surreal situations that a person feels the most present, the closest to reality.” What film had he been speaking of? She wished she could ask him now. Sean approached, clearing his throat. “So I hear you’re presenting at HFF.” “I’m subbing for someone else who wasn’t available.” She moved away from the coffin, not wanting to hold the conversation so close to the body. Sean followed. “Huh, so you replaced someone.” He took a sip of wine. “That’s my impression. But I don’t know.” She was downplaying it. The Humanities Futures Forum—or “huff,” as everyone called HFF—was an annual weekend fundraising event for the University’s major donors. “I presume you have ideas about what you’re presenting.” What if she just didn’t respond? “I’m not sure yet. Maybe something on cinematic fantasy or dream spaces. Like The Wizard of Oz, or maybe Stalker.” “Fantasy space.” He nodded slowly. “Well, you could devote the entire session to all the Tarkovsky films alone.” “It’s only a 20-minute presentation. But I’ll keep that in mind.” Marie held her smile. “I should go and pay my respects.” In her time at the University, she had begun to dislike Sean intensely, but as a point of pride she couldn’t quite commit to her dislike. He seemed unworthy of any intensity of feeling, he who made his students call him Doctor. But today, at the beginning of the new year, at the memorial for her former Professor, the prospect of seeing someone like Sean regularly, of forever dodging him at receptions and cocktail parties, of treading lightly while serving on the same committees, of presenting at faculty meetings, just seemed intolerable, fucking impossible. Across the room, attendees clustered around the Professor’s widow, elegant in her charcoal dress. “He wanted to go on his own terms,” the widow said. “He decided when he wanted to stop the treatment. So I’m glad he was able to have some control over the process, at least.” “And what about you? How are you doing?” Carolyn cooed. “I am so sorry. You must be so exhausted. Tell me there’s someone taking care of you.” Her voice was subsumed by the cicada chorus of others’ condolences. Marie placed her glass on a table and left. It was still bright outside. She walked across the quads and retreated to her office, where the tears did not come. In the silence of not crying, she heard the wind whistling from the closet. For the first time, she entered the passageway by herself. When she emerged on the other side, it was night, just as it had been before. The towering trees rustled in greeting, unloosening a familiar pine scent. The inky sky above was scattered with stars, the full moon. Implausibly, it was all still the same. She moved through the clearing uneasily until she spotted one familiar thing: the paper cup of coffee, where she had placed it last. It was still warm. Hot, even. She took a sip, scalding her tongue. Then she downed the rest of the cup. On Wednesdays, she taught “The Disappearing Woman.” That week, in the February thaw of the spring semester, they watched Ghost World, released in 2001, a year many of her students had been born. In the end, Enid, the teenage protagonist, gets on a mysterious bus and seems to leave town. The credits rolled. Marie flipped on the lights and looked around at her 15 students. “So, what did you think?” A student named Zach spoke first. “I didn’t get the ending. I mean, I like that it’s kind of open-ended, but it feels like a cop-out. Enid just gets on this special bus and goes where?” She reset the question. “Well, the ending seems to serve as a refutation of some kind, with Enid opting out of the town on this mysterious bus. One way to approach this is to ask: What is Ghost World trying to refute? Are there specific scenes that suggest an answer?” When Marie began as a teacher, she had directed all her efforts toward appearing unafraid. But training herself to appear unafraid was not the same as training herself not to feel afraid—the difference between pretending and being. She learned to become another person entirely as soon as she slipped into the classroom,. “There’s a lot of anxiety around this idea of authenticity,” Abby offered. “Like, the fake ’50s diner that plays Top 40 music. Or the art teacher who has these narrow parameters for what qualifies as art. Enid and Rebecca are always hyperaware of what’s inauthentic.” “Yeah, but wherever Enid ends up, she’s only going to see inauthenticity and hypocrisy. There is no place she’s going where she’s not going to see that,” said Grey. “What place could the bus take her that would meet her standards? It doesn’t exist.” Sarah added, “Yeah, because Enid gets to disappear, but most of us are like Rebecca: We’re critical of the world, but we still have to live in it.” Abby interjected: “But that’s the fantasy, right? That there is an escape, there is a way out of …” She trailed off, then restarted. “The movie doesn’t show you the answers. The ending simply opts out. It’s an aversion.” After class, Marie returned to her office and entered the closet’s passageway. She referred to the outside area as “the chamber.” Initially, it had served as a discreet area to smoke, a habit she had picked up again after the Professor’s memorial. She would lock her office door, move the armoire, and go through the wall. She lingered in the clearing near the entryway, blowing her smoke into the night air, surrounded by those swaying trees. The pleasure of this place, she discovered, was its extreme, surreal privacy. Over time, her visits had become more exploratory. In the chamber, there was the road and there were the woods. She heard the sound of water, a brook, maybe, but she never ventured far. The Professor had said he didn’t know how large the forest was. He had gotten lost there once, and had emerged days later, at a loss to explain his disappearance to his wife, who had filed a missing-person report. Using a key-chain flashlight to guide her, Marie walked along the silent road. She would never get lost if she stuck close to it; it would always lead her back to the entryway. Flowers grew in the ditches, thistle and yarrow and hyssop, some sagebrush and chamomile, and she collected some. The deeper she went inside the chamber, the more apprehension she felt. The road reminded her of her lost year. After graduation, she had moved back home, to the same house her parents had re-mortgaged to pay for her college. For a year she had lived like a dilettante, sleeping in too late too often and watching movies during the day. In the evenings, while her parents worked the dinner rush at their restaurant, she would often find herself walking alone along a freeway near the house, one that cut through a landscape of strip malls, a collusion of Target, Starbucks, and Orangetheory Fitness. It was a time when the future could have been anything, been anywhere. It was so open that it could have actually crushed her. She had offered to work for her parents at the restaurant, but they hadn’t sent her to the University so she could assume their livelihood. She had been named after Maria from The Sound of Music, the first film her parents had watched in America. “Climb every mountain,” Mother Superior sings, urging Maria to leave, to see the world. That whole sequence, the Professor had informed her once, was censored in Germany. “A nun advising a young woman to leave the convent and explore the world, the subtext being to sow her wild oats—well, it was more outrageous than any graphic scenes,” he had said. When she thought about the Professor now, she could understand, in a way she had not before, his unhappiness. She remembered, most of all, his complaints—the pressures of teaching, the lack of time to work on his own writing, and the bureaucratic gridlock. She also saw how he had created the terms of their relationship. How he had encouraged her to attend his office hours, those naps he’d allowed her to take. Even the act of disclosing his dissatisfactions … All those little actions had had the effect of making her feel like the exception. It was to his credit, maybe, that nothing had ever transpired between them. Maybe he had wanted her to initiate it, absolving him of liability. But she never did. She was content with the faint affect of romance, rather than its realization. By senior year, the Professor had become colder, more dismissive and impatient. She stopped going to his office hours. In his absence, she was ashamed of her reliance on his attention. She was naive, a clear windowpane. And now here she was. At a certain point, she stopped walking along the road, and pivoted to return. She dropped her bouquet of collected flowers—a mourning bouquet. What right did she have to mourn? She had brought flowers from the chamber into her office before, arranged them in a beautiful vase, and they had decayed instantaneously in front of her, as if in a time-lapse video. What remained were moldy, phosphorous, blackened stems, water that smelled like rotting teeth. What came from that world was not meant to live in this one. The Humanities Futures Forum began on a Saturday morning. The donors filed in, wearing polo shirts and sport jackets. The lecture room was designed like a conch shell, spiraling downhill toward the speaker, who stood at its carpeted bottom, looking upward at the audience. As everyone took their seat, the lights dimmed. The projector turned on, and speaking into the microphone, she welcomed them to the presentation. “Cinema, as they say, is the space of fantasy. Today, I’d like to show you clips from two films, 40 years apart: The Wizard of Oz and Stalker.” The presentation screen lowered from the ceiling. A black-and-white clip from The Wizard of Oz played. Dorothy awakes in her uprooted house, which has been blown away by a tornado, and the door opens onto the Land of Oz in full color. This was followed by a clip from Stalker, showing a group of men riding on railroad tracks into the “Zone.” The switch again from the sepia-toned film to the full-color foliage of a new realm. She had to remember to hold the microphone closer to her mouth.  “In each film, we journey through an alternate reality, a fantasy space, a second site—if you will—that is not of our world.” In the darkened room, she looked at the impassive faces of the audience: the distinguished alumni of and major donors to the University. HFF was technically a showcase of the University’s programs, but it was mostly just classroom cosplay for them. The campus served as an elaborate set that allowed the donors to pretend they were still college students. “Whether this alternate site is called Oz or the Zone, they share one similarity,” she continued. “The travelers move toward a central apparatus, a place where their wishes are said to be granted. For Dorothy and her friends, they are seeking out the Emerald City, where the Wizard resides. In Stalker, the travelers move toward the ‘Room,’ a fabled space that grants each passenger a subconscious wish.” The screen played clips from each film—the Emerald City, followed by an outside shot of the Room. Periodically, the donors moved to the back and helped themselves at the refreshments table, which was piled with finger sandwiches, canapés, and buckets of champagne. Unlike her, they must have already paid off their student loans. She continued with her little presentation. “I can’t help but observe that in each film, the protagonist never has an elaborate wish. Stalker has guided others through the Zone many times, but has never entered the Room. And after a hard-won journey to find the wizard, Dorothy’s only wish is for a return to normalcy, a return home. Fervent, elaborate wishing, as suggested by the actions of our virtuous main characters, can only be folly.” When she was finished, she answered questions as the refreshments table was replenished. Then the next group of donors came in, seated themselves. She went through the presentation again and then held another question-and-answer session. Then the same thing. Another group came in. She repeated the process. After the final presentation of the day, Marie understood what she had to do. She crossed the quads to Godspeed. Inside her office, she opened the closet, pushed aside the armoire, and disappeared into the chamber. She bypassed the road and went into the woods. It was hard to see at first, the full moon’s light obscured by the foliage, by tangled tree branches. She brought out the mini flashlight on her key chain, following the sound of water which led her to a stream, glinting in the dark. Further passage into the forest was blocked by the water, which seemed to emit a tinkling sound until Marie realized it was something else. It was a metallic sound, like jangling keys. There was something moving low to the ground, on the other side of the stream. The creature was bounding toward the bank. Reflexively, she aimed her flashlight toward it: a dog, thirstily lapping at the water’s edge. A Bernese, collared with tags. The dog’s reflection on the water’s surface was soon joined by the reflection of its owner. She looked up. The figure was standing at a distance. She shined her flashlight at it, but the beam was too weak to reveal a face. He was wearing his mackintosh and loafers, his standard dress on campus. She glanced back at the water. She was able to see a reflection of a face. Was this him or a facsimile? A chimera? She spoke, her voice tremulous. “Professor?” she said. There was no answer. Slowly he turned and moved away, the dog by his side. She stepped closer to the stream, raised her voice this time. “Nemo?” The dog stopped and turned to look at her. It barked before catching up with its owner. Across the stream, the two figures disappeared into the woods. The recurring sound of something hitting the wall, a hard clacking, made Sean step out of his office and investigate. He had been working in Godspeed that Saturday, trying to finish an essay. The door to Marie’s office, just down the hall, had been left open, but she wasn’t inside. He stood in the doorway, glancing at her desk—strewn with items spilling out of her leather tote—before stepping in. Hesitation implied wrongdoing. It was freezing, was the first thing he noticed. She had left the window open. The sound Sean had heard was the blinds smacking against the window frame. It was typical of her, her carelessness. He closed the window. The closet door opened. He glanced up to see her stepping through it. “I didn’t realize you were in here,” he said, hiding his surprise. “You left the window open.” “Oh, I wasn’t aware. I’m sorry. Anyway, I’m off to the HFF reception.” She paused, then asked, “Would you like to come with?” “Oh, uh—I have a few things to do in the office.” It was the first time she had ever invited him to anything. “Are you sure? I hear there’s an open bar. Donor events are always the most flush.” She smiled conspiratorially. Something was off, her lack of suspicion or irritation. He cleared his throat. “You should really keep the window of your office closed in the winter. It forces the heating system in the building to overcompensate, overheating everyone’s offices.” She nodded. “That’s right. I’ll make sure to keep it shut next time.” As if to herself, she said, “I should write a reminder on a Post-it.” “See that you do.” He slipped out into the hallway and back to his office. He closed the door and sat down at his desk, pivoting back to his laptop, the cursor blinking at him. None of the words he had just written made sense. From his window, he saw her leave out the front of Godspeed, her coat flapping behind her. He got up and went to her office again. He looked around again, as if she might materialize out of nowhere. He opened the closet, which felt drafty and smelled like the outdoors. It took a moment before his eyes adjusted, and he recoiled at a blotch of black mold growing across the wall. His first instinct was to blame Marie for not having called building maintenance earlier to eradicate it. A breeze filled the closet. It took another moment before he realized it was not mold. He approached the opening cautiously, ducking his head inside. He couldn’t see anything. Then, unable to stop himself, he rushed through the passageway. Inexplicably, he was outside. In a clearing somewhere. He made out the silhouette of a figure standing there smoking, their back toward him. Even though he could not see the face, he knew immediately: her hair, the same wool coat. Was that really her, though? Whom had he just seen leaving the building? He hastened toward her, hoping to take her by surprise. “But I just saw you leave!” he cried, triumphant and confused. The figure seemed to startle. She turned around to look at him. The cigarette fell from her mouth, snuffing out as it hit the ground."

        "story": "The trees are living things. The grass, the clumps of ragwort, the hard full ground. All of it alive. In the sky an airplane is on its side, turning east with its belly up, its engines whining, a rumble in its wake that is felt in the gut, an additional tremble in the limbs. They are all frightened. There are eight men. And the boy. Nine of them. There are six soldiers. The soldiers are outnumbered, and the men can count. But they can also count the guns, and although at least three of the soldiers are drunk, and one seems worse than drunk, another two are sharp and steady, with eyes that flit and rest, flit and rest, and the men know that it would be madness, it would be impossible, it would be suicide. They are under the trees, near the edge of the meadow. They had been driven for a while, not for long, not far from the place they had been. They had stopped by the side of the road and had been ordered out of the vehicle, the truck, and they had been made to leave the road then, to leave the road that went back to what they knew. Other soldiers had stayed there, with the truck. Two had stayed. So they must have thought, the soldiers, that six were enough. That six could herd, could guard, eight others. Nine. And if the soldiers thought that, then how could the men think that it was a mistake? That they stood a chance? Who were the professionals here? They had climbed a hill through brambles and rubbish to a wide, green meadow, and they had walked across, the soldiers at their backs, directing them. Left. Left more. There. To that line of trees. The meadow was empty, a faded green, perhaps a stream to their right as they crossed, in the distance, where the land seemed to dip and disappear. The sun had shone on them and they had talked to the boy, inasmuch as they could. Inasmuch as they could find in themselves something to say to him. Something comforting, distracting. Inasmuch as the soldiers would let them talk at all. Shut up. You. Shut up.​   There had been no airplanes as they crossed the field. The men had looked for them but they did not come; they were not there. Watch​ where you’re going. What could they have done anyway? The senior soldier, the one in charge, he was the most nervous. He did not seem drunk, but he was not sober. He was sweating and his eyes were bloodshot and he squinted at the light and watched the sky, and he stopped every few meters to look toward the top of the meadow where perhaps there was a stream, and he seemed to want them to both move faster and never arrive. Now, though, they are in the trees. And one of the soldiers has gone ahead. They wait. The men all sit on the ground. And the soldiers sit or squat on the ground. Only the boy stands, until a soldier shouts at him, and he squats down, then sits, carefully, not unfolding his arms, which the men can see are kept crossed over his chest because he wants to stop shaking, and he cannot. He is about, what, 8 years old. He was suddenly in their midst. They were moved from one vehicle to another, three of them, four of them, and then they were with these other men whom they did not know, and the boy. And both sets of men thought that the boy was with the others. Who​ is the boy? Your boy? No, is he not yours? Did he not come with you? And realizing then that none of them knew who he was. And the boy would not speak. What’s​ your name, kid? You’ll be all right. What’s your name? Who were you with? But he said nothing, and when they tried to ask the soldiers, the soldiers shouted at them to shut up. And yet they felt somehow that the presence of the boy changed everything. That his presence meant that they would not be killed. Everything was heading in that direction. But then there was this boy. Like a form that had been incorrectly filled in. An administrative error. Which would mean eventually that the soldiers would scratch their heads, blow out their cheeks, complain that some higher-up had made a mess, that they’d have to go back, have to take them all back, that this was wrong, that you can’t murder the men in front of the boy. And that you cannot murder the boy. The youngest of the soldiers scares the men the most. He is drunk. He carries a flask and sips from it, cradling his gun, staring at them while he does so. He is skinny. His head and his arms jerk as if there is some stiffness in his body, which might be fear or anger. It is probably fear. The men are managing their fear. Their minds are working and their eyes dart but they are trying very hard not to make any movements that are not ponderous, that do not seem entirely unthreatening. They are trying to appear lazy, slow. Their minds have never worked harder; their bodies are scared. Or perhaps the senior soldier scares them the most. He is looking into the woods where the soldier went ahead. He squats, leaning on his gun, looking off through the trees. He is middle-aged, ordinary-looking. The men wonder if they can talk to him, reason with him. What​ are you doing? How can you do this? How can this be right? They think that if they can form a good argument, something that appeals to him as a man, perhaps as a father, or as a brother, or as … at least as a man, that he will be persuaded. Run,​ go, fend for yourselves, he will tell them, and tell them that if they are caught, they will be shot. But they know that he is a professional. He looks away from them. He looks ahead. He squats, and his back is to them and he is paid a wage and he is patriotic and does his duty and is not a coward, not a traitor, not a sentimentalist, not any of those things that the other soldiers might think of him if he let them go. The men form their arguments. But they wait. The youngest soldier shuffles closer to one of his comrades and mutters. He is agitated. He seems to be asking where the other soldier—the one who went ahead—has got to. The senior soldier, without turning around, tells him to shut up. And what if they are wrong, the men? What if they are not going to be shot? The boy is there. The sun. A meadow. There is a stream just out of sight. Who would shoot them? The young drunken soldier who is as scared as them? The ordinary middle-aged man? Who would do that? They are being taken to another place. As prisoners. They are being moved. That must be it. They are valuable. They can be traded. And if they are wrong, and even if they are right, why scare the boy more by pleading for their lives? Why? Why do that? The boy looks at no one. He looks at the ground. The men think that maybe he is small enough, nimble enough, perhaps the trees are dense enough, maybe if he runs he will get away, dodging his way through the forest, through the woods, running, ducking, maybe he can make it. But none of them knows how to say this to him. None of them knows how to make him understand that he might try. Even if they could say it to him, they are scared that he would still be shot, shot as he ran, and that they, then, they would be responsible. And perhaps they would be led to another place, or back to the truck, back to the town, released, and the boy would be dead. These thoughts are like the heat. They are dense and thorough and they come but do not go. Fear is the slowest use of time, the largest part of death. It is a trap, like a leg trap, a claw, one of those, where you cannot move and suddenly the time you have left is all the time that is left in the universe. They do not know what he is thinking. The boy. Sometimes he will glance at one of the men, or at one of the soldiers. Very quickly. It is possible to see his eyes picking out the position of everyone around him, picking out the guns, picking out the trees, the sky, in tiny darting glances, mapping out his situation, the fear on his face at times looking to the men like it might in fact be courage, determination, cunning. Maybe he is thinking about running. But he is so tense. Maybe that is good. Maybe he is like a spring. But he is shaking so much. Maybe that is anger. They try to talk to him. They do not know what to say. The soldiers tell them to shut up. There is a shout nearby and the soldiers throw themselves down flat, and the men are doing the same when there is another shout, and the soldiers shout back, and sit back up and put their guns up again and laugh. Another group of soldiers passes close by. There are about 10 of them. One of them is the soldier who had gone ahead. He comes back. The boy has started to cry, the men notice. He is silent, but his face is wet and his nose is messy and his shoulders rise and fall. The passing soldiers are shouting, complaining about the heat. They shout about shovels and digging. They shout something about clothes. They are, some of them, carrying sacks. Black plastic sacks. They become quieter and then they disappear. The men speak to the boy. The soldiers shout at them. They make a decision, the men. They decide to continue to speak to the boy. He is crying, gasping for breath; he is as tense as a dry twig and they are afraid he might snap and turn to dust, so they speak to him. Hey,​ kid. You like playing? You like hide-and-seek games? What sort of games do you like? You like “I spy” games? ​The youngest soldier stands suddenly and walks toward the boy but the senior soldier shouts something and he stops. Let​ them talk. ​He stops, the youngest soldier. On his face is a terrible sort of hatred for the boy, and for the men, and for the senior soldier, and for himself. He wants nothing more than to raise his rifle and shoot the boy, or raise it and use the butt to hit the boy and hit him again, and again, not only until the boy is dead—the boy will die on the second blow—but until his anger is dead, and then until he has the courage to stop, or until exhaustion stops him. But he stands; he stares at the boy. He stares at the men. He turns and goes back and sits down again. What games do you like? I have a son; when he was your age, we used to try to count the trees in the woods when we went walking. Do you count trees? It’s hard to do. It’s difficult. You begin, and you count, but there are so many, and then you wonder, Have I counted that one already? Have I counted that one? Or this other game. Don’t look at your shoe. And now I ask you—what color is your shoe? What color are the laces? What color are the things at the side? The stripes. How many holes are there for the laces? You’re not allowed to look. You have to remember. They think, the men, that the senior soldier will hear them, listen to them. That he will hear about their lives, hear the sort of men they are, and that it will go in their favor. And they think that they are perhaps persuading him, indirectly. They do not crowd the boy with their voices. They take turns. They try to gauge if one voice works any better than another. The boy begins to look at whoever is speaking. That is progress, they think. That is something. But he doesn’t speak. Perhaps he cannot. Or perhaps he is foreign? Who knows? But they make their voices gentle. Even the men who do not have voices that are accustomed to children. They make their eyes soft, their faces kindly; they try, all of them, they try to calm him. They watch, too, the back of the senior soldier. They look for a change. They look for a softening in the muscles of his back. Perhaps if they mention again their own sons? Their own daughters? Perhaps. They watch. The boy, his face; the senior soldier, his back. They try to think of games. Some of them, in remembering games, in seeing the boy’s eyes look directly into theirs, remember the children that they played them with, and this brings them distress and the heat is thick even in the forest, as if another forest. The woods. They remember their own children. Some of them feel that they will never see their own children again. Some of them feel that they certainly will, that they certainly will, that life continues until it stops, that where there’s life … They look at the boy, some of the men, and he looks back at them, and they see their own children. Or they see their nephews, their nieces, their grandchildren, the children of their friends, their neighbors, or they see themselves, the children they were; they see in the boy the boy that they remember. And as the soldiers stir and stand and call, they want, more than anything else, for the boy to live, even if they don’t. That is all. Some of the soldiers that passed by have come back. Why? Why have they done that? Four of them have come back. Now the men are outnumbered. They could have. They could have tried. But not now. Perhaps if they had tried, the boy might have gotten away. In the confusion. The boy. But now. If they. There are too many possibilities. The soldiers stand, shout at them, get them to stand up, and the men’s thoughts become a concentration on nothing, a sort of void, but it is not that; it is simply that time has started to fail for them now. They all stand. They put a hand on the boy’s shoulder as he too stands, and they can feel the tremble in him like music in the distance, like something coming, but there is nothing coming, and the soldiers tell them to walk, to move, to walk​ on, go further in, go on​. And they do. And the trees come with them, and crowd in on them, and then lose interest and thin out, and they come to a clearing where there is a sharp smell as if of meat or dung or metal and the heat is precise, and they stop and see ahead a ditch or a hole in the ground and they know that they are, they are, they are where. And they look at the boy and he looks now only at them. As if in faces he can save something. As if in their eyes he can see that he is still living, and that they are still living, and that as long as he has faces to look at and faces are looking at him … maybe that’s what he is thinking; the men don’t know. They should speak up now. It is hopeless now. They clear their throats. The soldiers tell them to strip. What? Why? The men protest. Why?​ Everything? Why? But the soldiers just shout at them. Take​ off your clothes, all of your clothes, throw them here, put them here. ​One of the soldiers picks up their clothes, puts them in some bags. The clothes are all mixed up. The soldier doesn’t keep them separate. So how? So how will they get them back? How will that happen? They will be all mixed up. They will have to stand naked sorting through their clothes. Is​ this your shirt? Are these your boxer shorts? The small clothes. The men look at their shirts, their trousers, their underpants and socks and shoes being mixed up, being separated, combined with another man’s clothes, going into different bags. They follow their own clothes with their eyes, but they are lost. They will be shot now, they know. They stand with their hands in front of their genitals. As if dignity is simple. They shiver in the heat. The boy looks smaller still, his legs as thin as grass, his shoulders square but tiny, like a square of cloth, like skin. But perhaps they will be spared. They have heard of fake executions. Of last-minute reprieves. They have heard of Dostoyevsky; they have read great literature; they have loved people; they have memories, homes; they have friends and lovers and enemies, but not enemies like these, but they have memories, all these memories, and they feel they should think of their lives. But maybe they will be saved. Maybe they will escape. The boy is crying again. The soldiers want them to line up. Over​ there. Over there. Over there is a ditch. They walk toward it; they try to keep the boy in front of them, shielded from the soldiers. He holds a hand. He takes a hand. One of the men finds himself holding the boy’s hand. Then they want him not to be in front, because of what is in the ditch. They see it first, because they are taller. So they move him back among them so that he cannot see. And this they do together. And it saves them, perhaps, from understanding fully what they have seen. And they think, as they shuffle the boy back behind them, as they walk up to the edge of the ditch, closer, to the edge, move, that this is the case, that they are not really here, that they are instead in a separate place, watching themselves. They turn so that they face the soldiers. No one tells them to do that. They do it for the boy perhaps, so that he does not see, through their legs, past them, the bodies. He turns as well. The taste in the mouths of the men is a new one. The trees are so still, as if the air has gone. The boy does a strange thing. It is. What is he doing? The men look at him. He puts his hands up. He stretches out his arms, straight up, into the air, his palms facing forward. The men look at him. What is he doing? Trying to be tall. A game. Trying to reach a branch. He is even maybe on his tiptoes. The soldiers all stare at the boy. But they seem divided. The young soldier is furious. Another two, the same. The rest seem lost in a slumber, lazy, forgetful, as if they don’t know where they are, or what they are doing. The senior soldier, most of all, seems sleepy. Stop it. Stop. ​The youngest soldier is shouting, stamping forward, his gun raised. Put your arms down. I will shoot. I will shoot.​    The men pull at the boy’s arms, pull them down. He is stubborn for a moment. He resists. You’ll get yourself shot​​, they say to him. Stand behind us.​ They are almost annoyed, the men. What does he think he’s doing? Surrendering? Giving himself up? Arranging his body in a way that he thinks can be read, and understood. As if it is a password, a secret sign. As if this gesture supersedes all other gestures, and puts an end to this. Like the games he plays, in which a certain phrase, or a tap on the shoulder, or a hand on a tree, makes him safe. There is no time for this. They shuffle him again, backwards, so that they stand in front of him. He should not be here. He is a child. They step in front of him. They move him behind their bodies. He stumbles. They face forward. And when they can no longer see the boy because they are looking at the soldiers, and when the soldiers can no longer see the boy because he is behind the men, then of course, of course, that is when the shooting starts. The soldiers don’t know how. Suddenly their guns are firing and they are holding them and that is just how it is. They shoot all the men. Some of them several times. The bullets go into their bodies. Some of them die instantly; others linger for a few seconds and see the sky go over them and then the trees are upside-down. Only one bullet hits the boy. It hits his chest, at the side. He falls backwards into the ditch and he lands on the old dead. And the new dead fall backwards into the ditch on top of him. After just one or two moments, the shooting stops and the men are all dead. The soldiers look for twitches. They cannot see the boy, hidden as he is by the dead men. The boy is alive. For a short while. The bullet in his chest would have killed him on its own, eventually. But he suffocates beneath the bodies of the men whose last act was a forlorn attempt to protect him. Perhaps he realizes this, as he dies. Perhaps it comforts him. The soldiers withdraw. Later the ditch is filled in by other soldiers who have been tasked with the work. They do a good job of it. They tamp down the dirt. They remove a dropped sock, a pen, some shell casings. They throw branches and leaves and clumps of ragwort on the disturbed ground. These men are lucky. They see only the dead. They see only dead men. This is war. What do you expect. They saw no boy. The soldiers who did the shooting take the bags of clothes and burn them on a distant fire where other clothes have been burned before. Then they drive back toward their comrades, their quiet bodies carrying the war in their heads. Their truck is hit by a shell seven kilometers from the place of the murder. All but two die. One survivor shoots himself later that day. The other never regains consciousness. He dies after five weeks, in a hospital bed, in white sheets, his handsome, unmarked face mourned by his sister, the war over. No one knows about the boy. What boy? The men are dead. The soldiers are dead. His family, dead. There is no one who knows what happened. No one."

        "story": "In New Malden, they owned a corner shop together. It was the place where you could get the gossip magazines and newspapers from Seoul. Then, when everyone got smartphones, it became the place to get your smartphone cases: cute cats, cows, hippos. Gel pens, too. The students picked out a few colors while they got their fizzy drinks or, when it grew warmer, waited their turn at the shaved-ice machine that Harry had convinced his wife they should buy. At first, Harry had wanted a pinball machine and Grace had been forced to tell him that was ridiculous. What kid played pinball these days? Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. Harry never minded the kids—kids helped him forget that they had woken up one day to find themselves in their mid‑40s—but Grace went to the back whenever they came in. She said it was because their voices sounded to her like paper shredders, and they always picked up a box of something and left it somewhere else. But Harry knew it was because years ago, one of them had come up to the counter while Grace was arranging the pens and asked if they were really North Koreans and what life was like there and whether they had any health defects or bad teeth or were actually siblings or something. A parent had made a comment about them, maybe at dinner, maybe while passing the shop, and their kid had overheard. This had happened a few times over the years, would happen probably until they died. Harry and Grace weren’t North Koreans, not technically. Their fathers had defected together in the early ’70s and then a month later found a home here in the Korean community southwest of London that only grew larger as the decades went on. Grace’s father had found work as a delivery-truck driver, Harry’s at a home-and-garden shop where, later, Harry and Grace roamed the greenhouse, trying to learn the names of plants and flowers. If there was talk about the two men who had escaped from the north, the focus on them dimmed as the years went on, because more and more did the same and came to New Malden. Their fathers both married South Korean women; they had children, Grace older than Harry by a year. Harry and Grace had known each other all their life, their marriage an eventuality they never really spoke of until it happened. As children, they stayed over in each other’s apartments and their mothers cooked for them and they went to school together and they fought over what to watch on the television and who could pedal the bicycle and who would sit on the seat. When they were older, they poked each other in the stomach over who stole the other’s cigarettes, and they went to the park to smoke and to read bad sex scenes in novels out loud to each other. They snuck away to Wembley to watch the Freddie Mercury tribute concert, and when Annie Lennox opened her mouth to sing, Grace understood what it meant for your breath to be taken away. As the years went on, they practiced their Korean because they were forgetting some words and phrases, and they also wondered more and more about their fathers’ childhoods because their fathers never spoke about their life before this one. One winter, Harry and Grace were out walking when an IRA bomb went off two blocks away. Even from there, the force of it lifted Grace into his arms, like she was a parachute that had caught the wind. He remembered the strange, floating silence of it all. The ballooning of her red coat. Then the snow, which wasn’t snow but the dust of bricks that had been blown apart. And Grace suddenly tucked in his arms, the safest place she could ever imagine being, she told him later. He saw the unfolding map of them. He always had. It kept them going through the decades and the success of the shop. What he didn’t see coming was losing three of their parents within two years. Harry’s father died of a brain aneurysm and his mother of cancer, Grace’s father of a bad heart. Or a broken one, perhaps, after losing his friend, Harry’s father. Then Grace’s mother decided she’d had it with New Malden. Grace and Harry were unaware that she had ever felt restless there. She planned to move to Arizona, where she had a cousin, and to take almost nothing with her. Harry wasn’t a superstitious man, or for that matter a spiritual one, but with his parents and Grace’s father gone, he believed in grief, inexplicable, dumbstruck grief. That slow, heavy, animal feeling that was like a coat he could never take off. It altered the day’s colors, its sounds. Every moment reminded him of his father: A woman walking by cradling a plant in a pot. A voice from the street corner. A news report about North Korea. Grace’s mother showing up with a list of things that Harry and Grace could have if they wanted—an old photo album, clothes, an ashtray, an unopened bottle of whiskey, a bicycle. He never told Grace this, but he was almost relieved when her mother announced her decision to go to Arizona. Every few months, she sent a postcard of the desert, which Grace taped to the side of the register and which he almost always forgot about until the next one came. Harry thought maybe he would grow closer to Grace in some new way, now that it was just the two of them—that he would discover some different part of the map he had been carrying in his head. That eventually they would shed that coat and find some hobby to do together or make new friends or see more of the ones they had gone to school with. Maybe they would save up some money and go on holiday—somewhere, even briefly, where no one knew anything about them, where they were anonymous. But in the absence of their families, they grew more solitary, more separate in the life outside their shop windows and with each other. And if someone were to ask him why, or how, that had happened, he wouldn’t know. He would look up from the counter to find the afternoon almost gone and realize that if Grace had vanished, he would not have noticed. It was as if the days, and all the hours in those days, had hardened into a ring around them. He kept waiting for something to duck under the perimeter and reveal itself. They drove to work, opened the shop, stayed until closing, sold what they sold, received shipments, cleaned the floors, wiped the counter, kept the books, took turns eating lunch in the back room, called the police a few times a month for the drunks or the people who wouldn’t leave. Nothing changed. In their bedroom one night, he turned on his side, exhausted, and not for the first time startled himself with the understanding that the woman beside him was the only person left in the immediate circle that could be called his family. Maybe their decision not to have children had been wrong. Was it too late for that? Grace laughed. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t try,” he said, and winked at her. “Did you just wink at me?” Grace said. What was she always looking at online? He wondered how often their fathers had thought about the place they had left behind. Whether they had truly been happy here and whether they’d had good marriages and been able to ignore the South Koreans who said things to them and to their wives because of who they were—whether they’d gotten over the inevitable scuffles and the word Communist spray-painted on their cars. Whether they’d ever regretted having children. And what had come into their mind the moment they’d died. If anything had come at all. “Let me die first,” Harry said, more than once, and Grace always replied, “I don’t think so.” He started giving away the gel pens, trying to remember all the kids’ names, what the gossip was, what they thought was cool, what movies and TV shows to watch. If he tried too hard, he couldn’t remember his father’s face. It came to him only when he didn’t try. He had dreams of flowers whose names he kept forgetting. Enormous flowers that Grace carried away across a wide river, almost tripping as she kept saying, “I don’t think so.” Harry was closing up the shop one fall night when the bell rang and the door swung open. At first he thought it must be one of the kids, because it was a kid. He had a hoodie on, so Harry didn’t see the blood right away. Then the kid turned under the shop’s lights. His nose was banged up. The blood was coming down over his lips, which the kid kept licking like he was a dog. Harry reached for his arm, but the kid flinched. Harry said, “All right. All right. I’m Harry. This is my shop.” He spoke in Korean, wondering if the kid would understand. He did. “What’s your name?” Harry said. “I don’t know,” the kid said. He was 12, probably. At most 13. “I can’t,” the kid said. “I can’t remember.” Grace walked in from the back. She had been dumping out the bucket of water for the floors and was holding the mop. The kid froze and Harry assured him it was okay, she was his wife. They had planned to see a movie that night and go out to dinner, something they hadn’t done in a long time. He had even made a reservation at the sushi place they had gone to for her birthday one year, the one with the corner booth in the back with the curtains that had made her feel like they were celebrities. It was dark outside, and the three of them were reflected in the window, standing still. “We should take care of that,” Harry said. The kid wiped his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie and winced. “Let’s get you away from the windows,” Harry said, and reached for him again. This time, the kid let him. Harry guided him down an aisle into the back room, Grace looking at them the whole time, still holding the mop as she locked the front door. Harry sat the kid down. He pressed a handkerchief against the kid’s nose and told him to lift his head back. He asked if he remembered anything, and the kid nodded and motioned for Harry’s phone. The kid dialed. Harry could hear the woman on the other end pick up and begin to scream hysterically. The kid nodded a lot, as though the woman was there with them, and repeated that he couldn’t remember. The kid asked Harry where they were and he said, “New Malden, southwest London.” And then gave him the street corner where the shop was. The kid repeated everything back and then hung up and paused. He looked up at Harry. He said when he dialed and was talking to the woman, he knew that she was his mother, but now he wasn’t sure anymore. “Who else would it be?” Harry said. The kid rubbed his head and then lifted his head back again. He said he had never felt so confused. He said things were coming back to him, but it was like the things were a step away always, knowing he was trying to reach for them. Two policemen arrived. Grace had called. Harry thought the kid would try to run but he didn’t. He slid down in the chair, holding his nose, and shut his eyes. Harry went with him to the hospital. The kid gave him the number he had dialed, and Harry left a message for the woman about where they were going. He stayed at the hospital the three hours the kid was there, keeping him talking while a nurse bandaged up his broken nose, answering the policemen’s questions, listening to the policemen ask the kid questions. One policeman asked if the kid had been in a car. He said the nose injury indicated a possible car accident. The head trauma would have caused the partial memory loss. He asked if the kid had been driving. All the kid kept saying was “Cromer.” He thought he lived in Cromer. “On the sea?” Harry said. The policeman jotted something down in his notepad. Cromer was where Harry and Grace had gone on their honeymoon. The owner of the Korean restaurant down the street had a cousin who worked at a seaside hotel, and the cousin had gotten them a discount. They had spent hours on the boardwalk and visited the pubs and shopped. It had been grand. He wondered if the kid knew the restaurant owner in some way, if that was why he had ended up in New Malden. He said the man’s name but the kid shook his head. Then the kid’s mother arrived. She was much younger than Harry had imagined, in her early 30s and wearing the same kind of hoodie as the boy. She came up to Harry and said, “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” and began to cry. She smelled like a strong shampoo. She showed the police her license and then a photo of the kid in her purse. “Cromer,” the policeman said, handing back her ID. “Ten quid,” the policeman whispered to Harry as they watched the reunion. “Ten quid says it was the father. Took the boy. Got drunk. Crashed somewhere. We’ll find the car and then the man.” The kid clearly recognized her, but couldn’t quite place her. Still, when she hugged him, he put his arms around her, and they stayed like that for a while, their bodies like a giant clamshell on the bed. When Harry headed back to the shop, it was almost one in the morning. On the street, a taxi drove by and then two girls in skirts walked down the sidewalk, swaying their hips and twirling glow sticks. Grace was where he had left her, mopping the floors. He told her she had already done that. She yawned, rubbed her eyes with her knuckles. She asked about the kid. He wanted to say something about the movie and the dinner they had planned, but his throat was raw, his body suddenly as heavy as a potato sack. The radio switched to a commercial, the shop filling with the hurried sound of language like birdsong, and Harry reached over and unwrapped Grace’s fingers from the mop. Harry never found out who the kid was or what exactly had happened to him. He didn’t know whether the police had ever found a car, or whether there had indeed been a father. He looked for news online about a neighborhood incident the following day and the whole week but nothing was mentioned. He even asked a policeman, a different one, who stopped in the shop for a coffee. Harry explained. The policeman picked up a few of the pens on the counter and said that he was sorry, it wasn’t his case, but that Harry seemed to have done everything right. Harry wasn’t sure what the policeman meant. Grace was better at finding things on the internet, but she came up with nothing as well. “Forget about it,” she said, and moved on to whatever she was watching on her phone in bed. Maybe Harry himself had watched too many of those TV shows the kids liked lately. He felt a small knot inside him that he wanted to pick at but couldn’t reach. He wondered if the kid’s memory had come back. He wondered if the father was sick or into drugs or both. When Harry was a child, a man had approached his father one day and asked him if he was “right in the head.” Harry’s father was delivering plants to the restaurant down the street the day before it opened, and he had dropped a box. The accident wasn’t the reason the man had asked, though; his father hardly spoke and people wondered if he was mute. What did “right in the head” mean? Harry remembered thinking to himself. The next day, Harry asked Grace to cover for him and walked down to that restaurant. The owner, John, was sitting at a table preparing takeout kits, placing chopsticks and napkins into plastic bags. If he was surprised to see Harry, he didn’t show it. Harry himself was surprised to find that John’s hair had grown grayer. How long had they gone without seeing each other? John had lived not far from Harry’s father’s home-and-garden shop—he had even gone to the Freddie Mercury tribute concert with them—but they hadn’t spent much time together since Grace’s mother had left for Arizona. Harry asked about the cousin. “He’s no longer working at the hotel,” John said. He proceeded to tell Harry that his cousin had slipped on a step last winter and shattered his hip. The hotel couldn’t keep him on so he had gone farther north, to York. “We send him what we can,” John said. He asked if Harry was looking to get a deal at the hotel again, but Harry didn’t continue. Instead, he flipped through the menu and ordered lunch for Grace, pretending not to notice that John was looking at him. He knew John was wondering why they hadn’t come by in a while, not even for dinner. He waited for John to say something, like he was angry, upset, or confused, but John only smiled and kept going with his takeout kits. Harry sat down by the window. Shadows panned across the sunny floor between them like the carousel at the nearby park where they had gone as children. Watching the shadows, Harry suddenly felt as though he had been sitting here for many hours, as though it was much later in the day than he’d assumed it was. “You look tired, Harry,” John said. “You’re working too much.” “I’m all right,” Harry said. The smell of hot cooking oil drifted in from the kitchen. Harry leaned forward and took some of the napkins and chopsticks, placing them inside the plastic bags. “Does this have something to do with the boy last week?” John said. “He was from Cromer,” Harry said. “They say he was a runaway,” John said. “Who says?” Harry handed John a few of the kits he had finished. “They say he lost his memory before he got to where he wanted to go,” John said. “And now he must be back home with no idea of why he was running away in the first place. Or from whom.” John took some more kits from Harry and laughed. “Imagine us in front of Wembley, forgetting why we were there at all and turning around.” “She seemed all right,” Harry said. “The mother. I don’t think he would do that.” “Man, Annie Lennox,” John said. “Break your fucking heart. Bowie, too, of course. But really no contest. Look at my arm. Chills just thinking about it.” Harry scratched his own arm. He thought about what John had heard. He remembered the mother, who he admitted to himself was pretty, and the way she kept saying thank you to him. The food was ready. The staff gave Harry extra rice. John said to give Grace a hello. And then he said that they should both come to the next bingo night, and Harry said that they would and returned to the shop. He thought it would stay with him the way certain things did. A man asking his father whether he was right in the head; Grace in his arms as building debris fell on them like snow; the greenhouse at night; the spray paint on the cars. But the truth was that as time passed, whatever had been caught inside him got dislodged and fell. Harry stopped thinking about the boy or his mother. Or if the memory surfaced, he no longer lingered on it the way he had done that first week. No other news of it ever came through the shop, and no one, not even Grace, ever spoke of it again. The shop kept them busy enough that the days sped by. A few months later, they had a mishap with a large order—the delivery truck never arrived—and their life was consumed by the fallout for a week, as they tracked down the delivery, made phone calls, handled customers coming in and complaining. He expected that the stress would boil over, and that he or Grace would start a fight or shout or walk away, which was how they always dealt with stress. But that never happened. They shared a laugh. They rolled their eyes at each other over a customer who considered it a disaster not to have milk. They said there was nothing more to do tonight and closed early and went to that movie they had missed, which was still at the local theater—a comedy about a small-town girl in America heading into the city. The holidays came, which was always a boon for them, all the partygoers stopping in on their way to somewhere else. They sold out of things they never otherwise sold out of, like wrapping paper and scissors and those glow-in-the-dark stickers intended for children. For New Year’s Eve, they headed over to the community center, played bingo, and watched the new season of a Korean historical drama until John shouted about what losers they were and began a dance party. They played Queen, of course. Harry thought Grace looked beautiful, a little drunk, attempting to keep up with John as the two of them sang along and avoided the small puddles of melted snow from their boots. He thought the decades hadn’t been that long at all. He could still see them sneaking into the greenhouse one night as children because Grace was convinced something happened to plants when humans slept, and she wanted to watch. How they fell asleep under a tarp before they could notice anything, and how his father found them an hour later, worried sick. It was the only time his father had ever struck him. “You never run away,” his father said, on his knees, and then struck Harry again, quickly, the moon bright in the greenhouse and his father only a silhouette. Grace was the one who brought up Cromer early the following year. She was behind the counter and scrolling through a travel website on her phone. Her birthday was coming up. Winter also meant the off-season, and they could find a good deal. At the community center, while dancing drunk, they had promised each other that if they remembered the conversation they were then having, they would close up the shop for two days. They remembered. It was a New Year’s resolution, although they heard that no one called them resolutions anymore. Was that true? “How about Cromer?” she said, and he wondered if she remembered the boy. He had told her about how the boy kept saying that word over and over until his mother showed up. Harry reminded Grace now, and she said, “My God, I haven’t thought about that in ages. Whatever happened to him?” Harry didn’t know. Grace made a sound with her lips. She scrolled down and said that the hotel they had stayed at for their honeymoon was still too expensive for them, but that she had found another, smaller one a little farther down the street. “But still across from the boardwalk,” Grace said, and smiled. Harry wiped down the drip tray of the shaved-ice machine. He wrote a reminder to himself to do inventory tomorrow. “That’s what you want?” Harry said. “That’s what I want,” Grace said. They drove up at the end of the month. They notified everyone in the neighborhood, and everyone asked when they would finally hire help so that the shop could stay open on days when they were away. Harry and Grace promised to consider it, and then they considered it on the drive up, promising each other to start looking. “Any one of those kids who come into the shop,” Harry said, and Grace rolled her eyes. They stopped for lunch in Norwich. He mentioned that they needed to order more biscuits, and Grace made him promise that was the last thing he would say about the shop until they returned. They clinked their beers, ordered too much, so by the time they arrived at Cromer, the thought of dinner seemed impossible. They didn’t want to waste the holiday, however, and figured that a walk through the town would help them work up an appetite. They bundled up in their parkas and gloves and headed inland first, following a winding, narrow road lined with squat, two-story buildings each painted a different color. Grace was trying to recall a ceramics shop they had stopped in on their honeymoon. They had bought dinner plates there. She thought maybe they could add to the collection. She checked her phone, but couldn’t remember the name. Maybe it was a block away from where they were, but they found only a souvenir shop there, next to one that sold clothes. They surveyed the coats on display in the window, Harry following Grace’s reflection, the pale puff of her breath. She caught him looking. For some reason he was embarrassed, and he looked away. They didn’t locate the shop, but they found the fish-and-chips place they had eaten at almost every day. The diners in the small, half-filled room stared at them as they made their way to a table. They ignored the stares and reminisced about their honeymoon, remembering the church and the small park where they had sat sharing an ice cream. Then they remembered an argument they’d had about whether to head down to Great Yarmouth, Harry telling her what difference did it make, a coastal town was a coastal town. Grace smiled. Now, years later, she confessed maybe that was true, maybe he had been right. A man at the table behind her kept glancing at them. Harry glanced back and then asked if Grace was bored here. She nodded her head yes. “I’m sorry,” Grace said, reaching across the table. “I didn’t mean that.” He said it was all right. He turned to the window, where some large birds were flying out to sea. “Something on your mind, Harry?” “It’s better than I remember it,” Harry said, tearing open the fried fish with his hands and dipping pieces into the sauce. Grace’s father had liked fried fish. He mentioned this: Every time he had fried fish, he thought of Grace’s father. “Did you ever see them fight?” Harry said, taking another bite. “What?” “I don’t remember our dads ever fighting. They always got along.” “They did.” “They were too polite to each other.” “Don’t be absurd, Harry.” The waiter came by, and they ordered another round of beers. “I’d like to have seen them as children,” Harry said. “In their village. I bet they got into some nasty fights. Children aren’t polite. That’s what I like about them.” “They were half dead,” Grace said. “And when they made it here years later, they were more than half. They never caught up to being alive. That was their life. Catching up to everyone else. You know better, Harry.” “What is it about children that you don’t like?” Grace put down a chip. He could see her inhale and then exhale. And then she reached across and held his hand, squeezing a little. “I don’t know where you’re going with this, Harry.” Another couple walked in. Their beers arrived and music began to play quietly on the speaker. He didn’t know where he was going with this, either. As he squeezed her hand back, he noticed that the man behind Grace had gone. They finished their dinner, listening to the music. A light snow began to fall on the seaside town. They were going to walk some more, but they headed back to the hotel, passing the larger one they had stayed in, where John’s cousin used to work. They peered through the revolving door at the bright lobby, wondering if anything had changed, but when a bellhop welcomed them, they grew shy and kept going down parallel to the boardwalk, the ocean across from them. The snow never grew heavier but remained steady enough to dampen their jackets. It wasn’t unpleasant. He could taste it when in the small hotel room Grace leaned up to kiss him, and then the smell of it was everywhere as they undressed. It was like he was drunk on the snow and not the beer. He laughed, louder than he usually did. He was glad to be here. It was good that they had come up here again. Afterward, as they lay on the bed together, Grace’s hair dampening the sheet, she began to dream. He could hear her talking but couldn’t make out what she was saying. He watched her mouth move in shapes and then, giving in to an urge, he stuck his finger inside, gently, feeling her lips graze his fingertip. Her mouth moving like that aroused him. He looked down at her soft belly and the maze of veins on her thigh, growing convinced that she wasn’t really asleep, and then realizing she really was. What was she dreaming of? What lives did she live these days, or hope to live, that she didn’t tell him about? Grace rolled to her side, pulling the blanket over herself in her sleep. The room had grown cold. Harry stood to check the electronic thermostat only to find that it wasn’t working. He pulled on his pajamas and threw on the hotel robe. “I’ll be right back,” he said, knowing she wouldn’t answer, and shut the door as quietly as possible behind him. In the lobby, he mentioned the thermostat, and when the receptionist said that she would get someone up there right away, he hesitated. He didn’t want to wake Grace. He said, “We have an extra blanket. It’s fine, it’s late, how about tomorrow?” He had no idea what time it was. He was the only one in the lobby. He was about to head back up but found himself stepping outside instead. The snow had stopped. A thin layer covered the street and the sidewalk. He luxuriated in the cold and listened to the ocean waves. It was so quiet that he felt as though the world had vanished, leaving him and Grace behind. How would he feel about that? He was thinking of this when he spotted the figure on a boardwalk bench. The figure was wearing a hoodie and turned now and then to look at the pier and the ocean. Harry crossed the street. When the kid looked up, Harry immediately knew he wasn’t the kid he was looking for. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I thought you were someone else.” “Who did you think I was?” the kid said. Harry thought about that. “Someone I met,” Harry said. “You a perv or something?” He eyed Harry’s robe. “I don’t swing like that.” Harry shook his head, aware that shaking his head was ridiculous. He explained that he was a guest at the hotel but then wondered if he should have said that. A car drove by, the headlights lighting them up briefly. If the kid was frightened, he didn’t show it. When Harry asked what he was doing here, the kid replied, “This is my spot.” He opened the duffel beside him and asked if Harry was interested in the goods: Inside were counterfeit watches and sunglasses, cigarettes, jewelry, and small plastic bags of something Harry didn’t recognize. From the April 2021 issue: Paul Yoon’s short story “Person of Korea” Harry looked around. At the end of the pier, a bird landed on the railing as if it were balancing itself on the edge of the world, looking down at the receding water. “It’s not a very popular time or place,” Harry said. “I can be here anytime I want,” the kid said. “I can float like a butterfly. I can sting like a bee. Every day is free. You free, old man?” He wasn’t sure how to answer that. He wasn’t used to people calling him old. The kid opened one of the small plastic bags, picked up one of the things inside, and shook it. It began to glow. It looked like a cartoon drawing of a star. “It’s for the children,” the kid said. “They love it.” He inserted the star into a plastic gun of some kind and then aimed up above them and fired. Harry followed the glowing star as it shot up into the sky, going higher than he expected, and then floated slowly back down, swaying a little in the wind. Harry took three steps to the right, opened his hand, and caught it. When he looked back at the railing, the bird had gone. As Harry returned the star to the kid, he asked if he was from around here and whether he had heard about a runaway last year. “A Korean boy,” Harry said. “Twelve, 13, about the same age as you.” “Mate,” the kid said. “You’re shivering bad.” He tightened his robe and blew into his hands. Out on the water, near the dark horizon, a small vessel was speeding across as if sliding on glass. Where was it going? He suddenly didn’t know what lay directly east of them, across the ocean. Or how long it would take a small boat to get to that other coast. He had never been anywhere outside England. Neither had Grace. “What’s next?” Harry said. “What happens next for me?” Ignoring him, the kid stared behind Harry at another kid, a girl who had just walked out of the hotel where Harry and Grace were staying. She zipped up her puffer, waved, and crossed the street. “Hi,” she said to Harry, or the kid, Harry wasn’t entirely sure, her breath ballooning around them as she stuffed her hands into her jacket pockets and hopped in place. The kid had pulled down his hoodie and was fixing his hair. Then his face softened. “I’ll look out for your boy,” he said, and before Harry could correct him or figure out their story, the two of them hurried up the boardwalk together, going farther and growing fainter—another star flying up into the distance, the moonlight playing on the water, all their footprints in the snow."

        "story": "During the predeparture orientation at the crumbling three-star hotel by the sea—with its white portico and its lobbies smelling like a Native Jetty swamp—the exchange student is warned about a number of things. Ex-exchange students—by now so Americanized, you would think they had spent their entire lives in the U.S.—regale him with anecdotes both funny and scary: host fathers casually dropping the bass during dinner-table conversations, and host mothers quietly letting one or two rather pungent ones slip during walks in the park; host fathers letting their hands hover too close to the breasts and buttocks of their host daughters, and host mothers soliciting bare-bodied massages from their host sons. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. In Washington, D.C., where he arrives in August along with all the other exchange students from his home country, he has another set of orientations. Exchange students get a monthly stipend of $125 from the State Department. The host families report to the local coordinator, the local coordinator to the regional coordinator, the regional coordinator to the national coordinator, and the national coordinator communicates directly with the State Department—a chain of command through which news of discontent or concern ascends like an elevator. The prime warning here is loud and clear: Be rude to your host family and you’ll be thrown out of their house, put up for adoption by another host family; get caught drinking, doing drugs, shoplifting, impregnating someone, planning to flee or overstay, and you’ll be sent back home. It is the first time that the exchange student has fully escaped his family’s supervision, and although the temptation to hook up here—to give himself to another exchange student—is immense, and although the hotel rooms allow for such opportunities, he has that warning tucked securely in his mind. His days in D.C. are marked by strict celibacy. After four days in and out of orientations, sightseeing around the big, historic city, he boards a flight to his assigned state for a school year of cultural and academic exchange. He gets lucky with his placement: Visalia, California, middle-aged host parents. He is aware that many exchange students get sent to remote nooks in Iowa or Kentucky; he is also aware that many exchange students get stuck with elderly couples looking for company after their own kids stop bringing their families around for Christmas with the grandparents. On his first night, he anxiously eats a single slice of pizza for dinner. He is disappointed by his room initially, small and plain, devoid of character. Despite his disappointment, he lays out on the bed all the gifts he has brought from back home: embroidered Sindhi hand-fans studded with golden beads; a small, hand-painted rickshaw figurine; packets of Laziza kheer and Shan korma masala; kundan bangles for his host mother; a white kurta for his host father. His host mother is a stay-at-home mom to two kids, a 4-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl, and his host father is a sergeant with the City of Visalia Police Department. They live in an ordinary house on an ordinary street, not unlike the ones he has grown up seeing in American movies. His host mother is all safari shorts and spaghetti-strap tops, baseball caps and mineral sunscreen. Her freckles change color under variations of light. She is about the yard-sales-and-Costco-membership life. She uses phrases like “none’ya business” and “alrighta-Idaho-potato,” and is all about holding hands and saying grace before every meal. His host father is a big guy, a regular guy, unhandsome in a way that suggests he has never been handsome—thin lips, cheeks like a hairy fruit. He is mostly away at work and mows the lawn and rakes the leaves when he is home. He says things like “funk up my trunk” and “drop a deuce.” His host siblings are small: nubby shoulders and jutting knees, ribbons of coagulated snot in their snub noses. The brother is boisterous arms and a screaming mouth, smelling of the sweet rot of Jell-O and Go-Gurts; the sister is a fat, white fermented dough waiting to rise, smelling of soiled diapers, rash cream, and no-tears shampoo. The exchange student surprises himself by not getting homesick. He doesn’t miss Pakistan, or his family. He is in awe of his hosts, astounded that they’ve allowed a stranger—from a whole other country, no less—such uninhibited access to their house, to their lives, for 10 months. His family back home has barely any patience with external intrusions—relatives, guests, house-helps, even his sisters’ children. For the exchange student, school is a maze, a confusing colosseum. A boy, his first-day “buddy,” takes him around and shows him his classes, the gym, the cafeteria. A girl in his U.S.-history class offers him a dented Tootsie Roll, to “introduce you to American candy.” The kids in his debate class ask him questions about Pakistan, about terrorism and homemade grenades and Osama bin Laden. At home, when he has settled into the family well enough to not feel awkward calling his host mother Mom and his host father Dad, his host mother asks him if the bangles his mother has sent for her are expensive and whether she should put them on their family insurance plan. The bangles are cheap, fake gold, purchased from Liaquat Market, he knows, but he pretends to be clueless, says that he will ask his mother when he speaks with her next. He tells his mother that his host family loved all the gifts. Each time he thinks about the bangles, he pictures his mother in the sweltering Karachi heat, bent over a dilapidated kiosk in Liaquat Market—her kamdani chador clinging to her damp back—haggling furiously, excited to buy presents for his new family in America. He avoids the subject with his host mother, but she eventually brings it up herself. “Don’t ask your mother about the bangles,” she says with a pitying smile. “I don’t want her to get embarrassed.” Embarrassed on his mother’s behalf, he feels a lump in his throat, a sensation that returns during a mild altercation about coffee creamers. He starts drinking coffee—real coffee, made in a coffee machine, with ground beans, and not the stupid instant coffee that he is used to drinking back home—and to soften the edges of the bitterness that jabs the corners of his mouth, he pours in half a cup of creamer. For a few days his host mother lets it slide, allowing him to unabashedly splash his coffee with caramel, hazelnut, toffee, pumpkin spice, and French vanilla. Then, one day: “Coffee creamers are expensive,” she says in a tone that takes him by surprise, a tone laced with anger. “You cannot keep doing that. Use milk, or don’t drink coffee.” By October, from the pictures other exchange students post on Facebook, he gathers that snow has begun to fall in some parts of America, but the heat doesn’t relent in dry, sandy Visalia. At school, boys continue to wear tank tops, shorts, and flip-flops—yet another cultural shock for him, the school’s lack of a uniform code making him feel like a guest, not a student. What shocks him more are the armpits of these boys: unshaved, thick hair shimmering with sweat, flattened to swirls on their skin. He averts his eyes from the exposed armpits almost as quickly as he does when he sees anyone making out in public, which is something he was warned during the orientations never to stare at. Eventually, out of curiosity if not desire, the armpits of these boys become a bizarre receptacle for his attention. He notices that there is hair in the armpits of boys who do not even shave yet, boys still in the throes of puberty. Turfs, scant and abundant, black, brown, and golden, muddled with tiny white crumbs of deodorant, like snow caught in foliage if they use the white, powdery kind, or matted flat and wet-looking if they use gel. He notices the intricate web of wrinkles around the edges of their pits when they hold their arms too close to their bodies. He hears the susurration of wind passing through the abyss between a raised arm and a torso. He wants to bury his face under their arms and smell them all. At home, too, he notices his host father taking a plunge into the swimming pool, arms raised over his head to form an inverted V. The cords of his triceps snap, and the tender skin under the arms dips to form a cavity, ripe with two tracks of hair, dark-black and disorderly. His host siblings are too young to have any body hair at all; they are shiny and smooth like mannequins. He has a hard time making friends at school. The girl who offered him candy does not speak to him again; his “buddy” does not recognize him in the hallways, does not return his smiles or nods. His only friends are other exchange students from Croatia, Senegal, and Indonesia. Thankfully, he does not allow the early rifts with his host mother to convince him that his time with his loving American host family will be unpleasant, and in fact, soon enough, in his host mother he finds one of his closest friends in Visalia. She takes him along on every trip to the supermarket (she prefers WinCo over Vons and Shasta Cola over Coke; both choices save her money) and takes him to her loquacious hairdresser, who gives him a Justin Bieber hairdo with blue streaks. With parents, host or otherwise, he cannot be close to both, so he chooses sides, plays favorites. He is devoted to his host mother, and without protest, his host father recedes into the background, emerging every now and then to take him to a lake or to watch a bicycle race. His host mother, too, he notices, lacks friends—her days are chores-oriented; she keeps the house immaculate and cooks uncomplex but delicious meals. Or if she has friends, she does not invite them over for kiddie parties and brunches, or speak with them for hours on the phone; or if she does any of that, she does it while he is away at school. Sometimes he returns home to find her napping in the middle of the day, errands behind her, nothing else to do. His host mother is the coolest person he has ever met. The two of them talk over dinner, post-dinner, while putting the kids to bed, late into the evening. They end the day with a sweet “Goodnight,” picking up the conversation the next day exactly where they left off. They buttress each conversation about the present with anecdotes about the past, filling each other in on the parts of their lives the other has missed: siblings’ weddings, vacations, deaths in the family. They fall into a daily routine. He tells her each and every thing that happens each and every day at school; so what if one day she says—when he tells her about the boy who, during the first numismatics-club meeting, seeing the blue streaks in his hair and the skinny jeans hugging his skinny legs, walked up to him and volunteered the fact that he is gay—“Ugh, stay away from him.” In December, the central heating is turned on too high and he lies in bed naked, a thin throw blanket draped over half of his body. After an entire day of wearing a jacket, a feral, fermented scent rests in his armpits. He rubs his nose on the papery edge of one and sniffs. He imagines that the smell emanating from his armpit belongs to a white boy. He thinks about their bare, milky limbs coruscated with golden hair and ears pierced with diamond studs, their perilously sagging jeans and exposed boxer briefs. He thinks about standing close to them and inhaling their tangy white-boy breath and the antiseptic fumes of cheap aerosol sprays masking their sweet boy smells. The hardness between his legs makes its presence felt. He touches himself. He thinks about how the white boys carry triumphant gains in their arms and shoulders, the bulks of their chests, flaunting their physicality. How some of them wear tank tops and even in profile you can see the geometry of their hard abs, the plush palimpsest of hair on their navels. He thinks about the nebulous glow of their skin, about how the faintest trace of hair on their Adam’s apple catches the light in the sun, how a lone bead of sweat dangles for dear life from the bristles on their chins. They always smell so clean that he imagines God softened their flesh with laundry detergent. Then he thinks of fathers back home, pressing razors into their sons’ palms after Friday prayer, after the sermon in the mosque, the shrill voice of the maulvi echoing in his ears. Cleanliness is half the faith. He hears the hushed tones of fathers whispering to their sons, instructing them to cut—to a size smaller than a grain of rice—the hair in their armpits and above their members; to follow the Sunnah, the lifestyle of the Prophet. He imagines all of these scenarios in his head because his own father has never had such a conversation with him, never pressed a sharp razor into his soft palm. These are scraps of information he has picked up from boys around him, in school and in his family. He folds his arms behind his head to look at the skin of his armpits, razed to the texture of sandpaper, each pore agitated and red. Soaped and scraped, soaped and scraped, ardently scratched with a razor every week, the sharpness tingling long afterward. And before he was big enough to hold a razor, he remembers how his mother used to strip his armpits clean with homemade wax. How she stood him in front of the mirror to show him how the wax had to be heated on a steel plate that had been blackened over the stove, and then a stick, usually from a leftover ice pop, had to be dipped into the hot, gluey wax, which was then immediately smeared in an even sheet over the hair. His mother taught him to wait and blow gently on the wax, let it harden and shrink and tug on the skin, and then to pull, always in a single direction, and always quickly. Sometimes the pain made his eyes water and sometimes little ellipses of blood formed on the broken skin. And sometimes, even worse, especially when he started waxing his own pits, he tugged too hard, or too slowly, or in the wrong direction, causing a violent breaking of a hair or two—causing within a week the problematic hairs to grow inward when they returned, causing boils to emerge in his pits, boils that grew and grew until they waged war against the tensile strength of his skin, and the skin eventually gave way, causing the boils to burst open, oozing pus before becoming small again, disappearing over time, leaving behind shriveled dark spots and congealed skin. Days later, hair would appear in his armpits again, tiny and prickly, like the heads of toothpicks in a jar. He looks at the mutilated pores in his armpits and wonders, This is what they come out of, the hairs? The pores are, he thinks, tiny portals—the birthplace of hair. And what is inside? he wonders. Long spools of hair coiled and resting under the warm skin? Coils of hair unwinding themselves every week and squeezing out of the sievelike membrane of skin? He imagines covering the pores up with tape or glue, or better still with cement, so he never has to shave again. And then it hits him, the jubilant realization that here, in this place, he really doesn’t have to. Half of his time in America has passed, and yet each time he visits a grocery store with his host mother, he experiences afresh the joy of seeing all things familiar and unfamiliar. Every time he purchases Aquafresh toothpaste, St. Ives body wash, and Clinique moisturizers, he feels like he has moved up in life. Yes, these products are available back home too, but in large, shiny marts frequented by the rich, where each time he goes, just to lurk, he is trailed by store clerks, their suspicion barely masked by their eagerness to offer advice and answer questions. Everything tastes different here, though. Pineapples are hard and dry; mangoes are sweet ghosts of themselves, sold in a box or a can, dipped in cancerous syrups. Milk is not delivered by a fat man on a scooter every morning at the break of dawn but pulled down in cool bottles from pristine shelves. It does not smell of the warm, febrile belly of the cow. It smells of nothing and tastes like chalk. On nights when his host father is away at work, he and his host mother—after putting the kids to bed and cleaning up the mess of swimming-pool noodles and dismembered limbs of toys—watch TV late into the night. Project Runway and America’s Next Top Model—they love these shows. There was a time in his life, around when the Bollywood film Fashion came out, when he grew obsessed with the idea of becoming a dress designer. His family found him one day—tangled in fabric that he had taken from his sisters’ creaky closet, face made up like a Barbie’s—and the successive name-calling, shaming, and blackmailing eventually subdued his interests; but as he sits down to watch these shows with his host mother, a rekindling occurs in his heart. He finds himself unable to speak, the words slipping further and further away from him after his host mother says—as he comments one night on how talented the men on the show are, how beautiful the dresses they design on such short notice, using such scant materials—“If they can be called men at all.” Undoubtedly his host mother knows what he is, they both know, but he is scared to say it. He does not have words yet to argue about or explain how he feels to his host mother—the shape of his hurt remains unknown to him—so he argues with her about milder things: petty arguments about his chores and about spending more time on Facebook than with the family. When he tells his host mother it’s sunny outside and he wants to tan—and she says that he already has really dark skin and doesn’t need to—he says she is being racist. When she yells and flings things in the air, he locks himself in the bathroom and pretends to cry. The State Department issues him its first disciplinary warning. For his 16th birthday in March, his host family takes him to Vegas, a city he has expressed a desire to see ever since he arrived. They don’t do much there other than walk up and down the strip, in and out of hotels, but it is the best birthday of his life. During the last ride from the strip to the hotel, he gets into the cab and murmurs—under his breath so the driver doesn’t hear, in a voice full of mock amusement—“So now, where are you from?” Thinking that he is making fun of his host father for being nice and conversing with the cab drivers (when he’s simply remarking on the fact that in the two days in Vegas, every single cab driver has been a non-American, from Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Bosnia, or Ukraine, speaking accented English, just as he does), his host mother scolds him in front of everyone, lecturing him on the American values of politeness and kindness. A few months have passed since he last shaved his armpits. The hair has exposed its unseen potential, growing longer and longer every month. Though he should be sickened, he is delighted to find, post-shower, the solvent smell of fresh sweat beneath his arms, his pits mildly sticky like a Post-it pressed and plucked too many times. In his more daring moments, he steps outside the house wearing tank tops recently purchased from Target. He finds excuses to expose his armpits, to show the world his new, benign development. He scratches the back of his neck to rid himself of a nonexistent itch; he reaches for the top shelf in the library to grab a book that he replaces seconds later. He is fascinated by how the barest puff of air provokes the hair in his pits into motion, flickering like a hundred candlewicks. How devoid of shame this ostentatious display of virility, how lacking in grace. How beautiful. The applications arrive for the next year’s crop of exchange students and are sent to the current host families, neatly plastic-coated. His host family goes through all the forms, asking his opinion on each applicant. His host parents decide not to host next year. They want to take a break, they say. He feels two things simultaneously: A part of him is happy that for a while, he will be their only exchange-child experience, and a part of him feels he has let them down so much that they will never want to host again. Several months later, when he is back in Karachi, he will learn that in the end they did decide to host another exchange student, from Senegal, and a year later he will learn that they decided to adopt him, to keep him forever. They will announce it on Facebook, our new son, and set up a GoFundMe to pay for his college education. They will make him a permanent member of their family, just as he had imagined they would—but didn’t—make him. As spring arrives, his host parents go out together—to an annual police officers’ dinner—which is something they do not do often. His host mother’s sister, the one who lives in Fresno, comes over to babysit the kids, along with her hot jock of a husband and their son. When his host parents leave, she invites her half brother and his girlfriend over too. He sits talking to these people, telling them, yes, he is from Pakistan; no, that’s not in Saudi Arabia; yes, he is a Muslim; and no, he doesn’t speak Islam. The girlfriend is especially impressed by the exchange student’s school newspaper, which has recently published a heavily plagiarized feature he has written. Eventually, boredom stalks the gathering. Smiles are exchanged. A bottle of wine is produced. Passed around and gulped down. Another bottle. It is not his first time drinking alcohol—he has been stealing vodka and rum from the pantry throughout the year, mixing it with orange and cranberry juice—but he says that it is. This fascinates the group, and they fill his glass again and again. His host siblings sleep in their room peacefully, soundlessly, but when his host parents return home to a party of half-passed-out babysitters, their yelling wakes them up. Later, when his host father’s younger brother is getting married, his host parents let him drink under their supervision. They don’t seem to notice that he gets drunk out of his mind. In the privacy of the bathroom, where he runs to throw up, he thinks to himself, Now I am drunk and should act like a drunk person. Drawing on images of drunk people—mostly from Indian movies and TV shows, because he has never seen a drunk person in his life in Pakistan—he begins to sway and stagger and slur his speech, much for his own amusement, but more for the drunken girls in short, shiny, sequined dresses, who call him cute and take selfies with him on their iPhones. When he is no longer able to walk or even stand, his host father carries him to his room and puts him to bed. For years he will replay this memory in his head again and again, trying to conjure the exact image of his host father lovingly planting a kiss on his forehead and covering him up with crisp white sheets and whispering, “Goodnight, son.” He will remember, too, how minutes later, he purposely rolled off the bed, just to be held again and be put back in by his host father. “Grounded and phone is taken away”: He uploads a status on Facebook several weeks later, using the small laptop his host parents have loaned him for schoolwork. As he had hoped, his host mother comes out of her room, into the living room, where he is sleeping—his own room is occupied by his host father’s parents, who are visiting. “Give me the laptop,” she whisper-yells. “Now.” His phone has already been confiscated, all his messages on it, conversations with the boys he has pursued at school—to no avail—and the phone has no lock. He shuts the laptop and hands it to her. She will, of course, read all his chats—with the boy in his Spanish class, with the one who is a peer tutor, and with the one he met at a debate tournament. Later, she will confront him not about the risqué messages to these boys, but about the fact that he lied to one of them, told him that during his visit to Las Vegas, his host family had taken him to a Dev concert, and also to the VMAs, where he had seen Taylor Swift perform live, all of which showed that he was ungrateful and did not fully appreciate what his host family had actually done for him. After a few days, his host father takes him out for coffee, tells the exchange student that they love him very much, but if he continues to disrespect his wife, they will have no choice but to ask him to leave their home. It’s May—one month to go. The thought of leaving crushes him. Despite the fights with his host mother, there is no place else he would rather be. He feels bad about not missing his family, his real family back home, his sisters, his father, his mother—especially his mother—who has torn her clothes to dress him, has flung pieces of meat from her plate onto his. His mother whom he loves but has never spoken with the way he speaks with his host mother: endlessly, ’til he runs out of breath. Sometimes in the middle of the night he wakes up from nightmares—he dreams that he is already back home, in Pakistan. His body breaks out in a cold sweat and his armpits, now so full of hair, are clammy. His fights with his host mother become more frequent, more virulent. He has figured out ways to hurt her, and he finds it thrilling to watch her face dissolve in a mix of anger and sadness. Calling her “Host Mom” does the trick. Telling her that he is not interested in going to family events and wants to focus on community service—so he can get that certificate from the White House, signed by Obama—works too. So does eating a snack as soon as he gets home from school, and then, at the dinner table, telling her he is no longer hungry for the meal she has spent a lot of time preparing. Some days he does not understand why he pushes her buttons. His host mother sings Lady Gaga with him. She puts together his costumes for the spring-fling week at school. She passes down Aveeno skin-care products for his cystic acne. She trusts him to take care of the kids while she does quick errands. She tells him that as a teenager she was very rebellious and belligerent—getting suspended from school, bringing back bad boys, calling her mother a bitch, etc. Some days the exchange student wonders if he has been karmically brought into her life, to give her a taste of her own medicine. Despite the ceaseless chatter, he never feels truly seen or accepted by her. Isn’t half-formed love what he’s received all his life? On the night of his graduation, as a surprise for him, his host mother cooks chicken korma using the spices he has brought from home. His local coordinator and a few other exchange students, and his host mother’s sister and her hot jock of a husband and their son and his host father’s brother and his newlywed wife and their unborn child, are invited. When he comes home from the graduation ceremony, he is greeted by the smell of garam masala and for a second, he thinks his mother has come all the way from Karachi to cook dinner for him. Before he sits down to eat, his host mother grabs him by the arm, drags him to his room, to the dresser in the corner, on the shiny surface of which he had left, while rushing to get ready for the graduation ceremony, the clippings of his fingernails. Their ragged edges streaked with black dirt stare at him. “Do not do this ever again,” she says, her eyes aglimmer with fury. “I almost threw up.” Then, she leads him back out and smiles at the guests. He feels ashamed, his hunger replaced by sadness. Later at night, crying in his bed, he thinks that he did not even ask her what she was doing in his room, and then he remembers that it isn’t his room at all. One week before he is to officially return home, he is asked to leave. The reason for the argument with his host mother is irrelevant, as it always is. They are hurtling along Church Street at high speed to the Hair Mania for what will be his final haircut in America; tumbleweeds hurl themselves in their way with a suicidal ambition. The steering wheel is slapped; words like fuck and goddammit fly from his host mother’s mouth. He—sensing that he has set in motion something that cannot be reversed—clutches his breath. The warm June sun shines in his eyes. His local coordinator comes to pick him up from the salon, not his host mother, and he knows what this means. On the ride home, his neck and back itch, chopped hair clinging to the damp skin. His host mother is waiting for him at the door, the cordless phone in her hand, host father on the line. After a preamble about his disappointment and hurt, the father says, “I will have to ask you to leave our house,” and though he has expected this, he allows himself to be shocked by the dictate. He falls to the ground, cries. “I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry,” he says now to whoever will listen to him: his host mother, who averts her eyes; his local coordinator, who shrugs; the elder of the two host siblings, who watches with wide-eyed horror, and the younger girl, who puts her foot in her mouth. “Pack whatever you can,” his local coordinator says. She will send for the rest later. At his local coordinator’s parents’ house, he will occupy an empty room until his future is decided by the national coordinator. He sleeps in a foreign bed all over again. Outside the window, an unfamiliar street, with identical cream- and beige-colored houses; the moon is full, and full of scars. In the morning, post-shower, post-breakfast, his local coordinator calls. She speaks in a low, mournful voice. “Yeah, dude, sorry, we are putting you on a flight back home tomorrow.” There is a silence, because he doesn’t know what to say, what to do with his voice. Then there is laughter, a thigh being slapped. “I am kidding, dude, relax. You’ll go home after a week, with everyone else. As planned.” Relief spreads; his eyes fill with tears. A knot loosens somewhere inside of him. “Your dad will come to pick you up tomorrow afternoon.” The muscle of his heart unfurls. But then: “No, they are not taking you back in.” A pause. “For, like, a last family meeting. To talk.” The next day his host father runs late but eventually comes to pick him up. While he is not exactly hostile, he is not cordial either. His host father asks if he is hungry, if he has eaten. The exchange student explains his lack of hunger. “Anxiety,” the host father concedes, and buys him a sandwich anyway. At the dining table in their house once again. His host parents on one side, their backs to the kitchen, and he on the other, his back to the window that looks out onto the backyard and the pool. His host parents’ English is calm and impeccable, their words like birds returning at night. He feels the language sharp in his mouth; his tongue chafes against his teeth. He gathers his shattered voice, shard by ragged shard. He begins with a dramatic prelude—the memory of which will flush his cheeks and make him cringe for years to come, though later he will not remember if this was rehearsed or spontaneous. “Home is where the heart is,” he says, voice quivering, snot halfway between his nose and lips. It is a phrase he has picked up from a Christmas ornament. He tells them they are—this is—his home. He apologizes, accepts his mistakes, makes no excuses. A laptop screen is flipped open, turned in his direction. His eyes take a moment to adjust to the brightness. A Word document, a couple of thousand words long. A diary of his arguments with his host mother, trifling skirmishes, cataloged by date and time. The fog in his head clears, things come into focus. Words such as annoyed and too long glisten on the page. It feels like a betrayal that his host mother has kept a diary all along. A copy of the document has been emailed to his local coordinator and to the national coordinator, who upon reading his host mother’s notes will, the exchange student later learns from his local coordinator, question whether it was a loving household for him anyway. “Feeding off of each other’s negativity,” someone will suggest. The document is also emailed to the exchange student’s family back in Karachi, but he will log in to his father’s account to delete the message before his father can read it. When his host family says that they forgive him, that in the future the doors of their house will be open to him, he feels irritated. These wrapped gifts of kindness, packaged in a supremely American brand of congeniality. Back at the house of his local coordinator’s parents, he is surprised when, for the first time during his nearly year-long stay in America, the electricity goes out. He is used to load-shedding, which happens almost every day in Karachi, but he has allowed himself the luxury of getting used to the constant presence of artificial light and air around him. The whir of the refrigerator disappears, and the restless shadow of the ceiling fan attains a state of uncanny calm. Soon the recycled air in the house begins to shift, an osmosis from cool to warm to unbearably hot. His hairy armpits are damp; a wet film of sweat has formed where his left foot rests on his right. He mistakes the churning in his stomach for hunger. He goes to the kitchen and retrieves the leftover sandwich from the fridge. He feels queasy—sick, not hungry—and tosses it in the bin. He wants to throw up, so he goes to the bathroom, leans over the toilet, and heaves. Nothing. He remains hunched over the bowl, his mouth dry and tears in his eyes. How much he has lied to others, to himself, he thinks, everything a deception, a facade. When his parents come to pick him up at the airport a week from now—reunited with the well-disciplined boy they know from back home—their eyes will swell, faces pasty with pride. He should shower, he thinks, and takes his shirt off and then his shorts and hangs them up. He looks at his face in the mirror. Rheumy, jaundiced eyes; ruddy, terra-cotta complexion. Sunlight makes the patina of sebum on his skin gleam. The boy he sees is not the one who arrived here 10 months ago. He has a small belly now, lean muscles on his arms from all the swimming, and pimples scattered all over his forehead. Face saturated with fat, cheeks the size of apricots. He has lost fluency in the language of his body; only now is he noticing. He picks up the razor. For a split second the blade catches light from the sun streaming in through the window, a small spot in its center, from which brightness explodes. But the hair in his armpits is too long and unruly now. He imagines it will get caught in the blade, tangle, and become stubborn knots. He puts the razor back down. He raises both his arms and places them on his head. He turns his head left and then right, sniffs—that new scent of his body: animal and ethereal and smarmy. When did he become this person, and how?"

        "story": "Watching The Bachelor was supposed to make life easier. I started getting into it a year or so after I began working at my brother’s salon. I had a regular stable of clients, but none was particularly in love with me. The problem was not my skill—I am talented at hair removal and competent at mani-pedis. The problem was our Yelp reviews, which said things like “Good eyebrow threading but that one girl makes you keep your eyes open for a whole minute before she starts and the way she stares makes you think she’s trying to suck your soul out.” Which I thought was dramatic. When he saw that particular review, my brother came into the back storeroom where I was taking my break and waved his phone around like a distress signal to get my attention. I was reading a blog about people who believe they’re already dead, and how psychologists find it very difficult to treat those settling into the placid state of afterlife. They are basically unconcerned with going to work, and surprised you can see them at all. “Earth to Avanti!” My brother read the review aloud. “Can’t you just learn to make small talk like a normal person?” I was willing to learn. He conferred with his girlfriend, who suggested I watch The Bachelor. She said it was like the NFL for women. Like if the whole world shared the same high-school friends to gossip about. She said there were blogs and podcasts and tabloids and Instagram feeds and brackets and betting pools. She said that everyone watched it, that even some men indulged, discreetly and lovingly. It would let me into the world, this show. This happened in the spring. Outside, the Bradford pear was stinking up the parking lot and dropping petals that looked like used Kleenex. As summer set in, I binged, taking careful notes inside my studio apartment, with its thin walls and rattling window AC unit, while the humid days thickened outside. By late June, my eyes were starting to hurt and my hand was starting to cramp and my social-media feeds were crowded with images of all that normalcy, and yet I still was not much better loved by clients. Until Camrynn Hare—an old high-school classmate—walked in. Some years ago, a white girl would not have come to our salon, but eyebrow threading was now mainstream. When she leaned back, I began staring into her cement-colored eyes but stopped myself. I asked if she watched the show and she made an intense mmhmm noise. I remembered how she’d passed around a tube of snake-venom-infused lip gloss by the lockers, her whole clique pursing their slick, plump mouths. “What do you think of that Earl guy?” I asked. Earl was the villainous country singer with the snake tattoo coiling up his right arm. “Oh my God,” she said. “He was in SAE at SMU with my maid of honor’s fiancé, and—” and then we started to talk. I lost track of my limbs as we discussed Earl’s true motivations, his upcoming gigs in Nashville, and whether or not he’d secretly had a girlfriend the whole time. As she opened her eyes to blink at her newly pruned brows in the mirror, she cocked her head. The hair that had once been bleach blond was now chestnut brown and rose in a country-club pouf above her head. “I know you from somewhere,” she said. I agreed that she might. However, neither of us could place me. I booked her for another appointment four weeks out and mentioned that we were on Yelp. But the point is what happened on The Bachelor during Season 12. This was the year that David P. Li’s huge Asian blockbuster movie came out, and everyone was psyched about representation, which was another way of saying that people who previously felt invisible now felt like the world was made of infinity mirrors and they could see themselves multiplied and omnipresent, like a clone army. So when everyone found out that superstar David P. Li was super-single, ABC was like, Let’s cast him, and it did. Harry Chettiar came into the salon just before the premiere, in early fall. His parents are from Singapore, like David’s; his mother is Chinese and his father is Tamilian and his real name was Hari, but he’d changed the spelling. He enjoyed having his eyebrows plucked. Not threaded. Something about the many tiny pings of pain (pleasing) instead of the single dull stretch (numbing). “What’s new in the world, Avanti?” he asked when he checked in at the cash register. I looked past him, through the salon windows, at my trifling world: the rest of the strip mall and the Ethiopian restaurant and the Target and the gas station my uncle owned. The sky was the color of overwashed denim. “Not much,” I said. “Are you ready for the Bachelor premiere?” He admitted he wasn’t. I led him to the back room, where I tend to take male clients, who find the front of the salon too exposed. I explained about David. Harry hadn’t seen the blockbuster. “Was he in those vampire rom-coms?” “Yes,” I said. “He was the vampire boyfriend’s best friend.” In those movies, David P. Li worked out next to the main vampire, and over moonlit sessions at the gym they discussed the vampire boyfriend’s love for his human personal-trainer client. Harry lay down on the waxing bed. “I got the scoop on all the contestants,” I said. “Want to hear?” I engaged with all Bachelor Nation media. One of the brainier blogger/podcasters, who likes to remind people that she attended Williams College, invited me onto her show once, as the superfan guest. I did not click with my fellow panelist, Dr. Donna Linklater, a professor of cultural studies and the author of When Reality Isn’t Enough: Nonscripted Television and the Rise of the Modern “Romance” Lexicon. When I asked her if she believed in love, true love, she invited me to sit in on her freshman seminar to have my mind blown with critical theory, but I had to work, and anyway, I didn’t think that the way she talked, full of isms and citations, would help with small talk. “Tell me,” Harry said. He liked to have me talk while I plucked. I pulled from the middle of his face first. When his brow furrowed, I pressed my thumb to it and reminded him to relax. “There are 30 women,” I said. “They’ll all show up the first night in limos, right. And they’ll strut out and say, Hi David, it’s so wonderful to meet you, you’re even hotter in person, I learned this word of Mandarin for you, etc.!” I moved to his right brow. Harry exhaled. I felt the ring of his breath on my chin, just the size of an engagement ring. “Thirty women.” He gritted his teeth. “I can’t even wrangle one.” “They’re going to make the first limo all Asian women,” I went on. “I submitted an audition tape, see, and if they’d picked me, I would’ve been in that bunch.” “I’m glad you didn’t get picked,” he said. “That’s not nice.” I paused, tweezers in the air. There were mirrors all around us. I shook my head and gave myself the spins from the many incarnations I saw of me. Harry opened his eyes as I finished the right brow and leaned toward the left. I looked away because I didn’t want to be accused of soul sucking. I used to think the moment before a beauty treatment required intimacy. I’d gaze at the whites roped with red, the ringed retinas, the black-hole pupils. I thought that if I stared hard enough I would fall into the right pair of pupils. I would tumble through the black hole and disappear and no one in this earthly reality would ever ask me to remove another hair again. My brother knocked on the door. “Avanti, your next customer is here.” Small talk, not big talk, he kept advising. “Would you like to watch the show with me sometime?” Harry asked. And then I did look into his eyes. They were light brown. It would be like muddying around in a tiny wading pool if I fell in there. I would not get lost; I would still be stuck on Earth. Season 12, teasers.  David gazes out at a sapphire-blue ocean.  David grabs the face of a faceless girl and brings it to his. Both their faces disappear as the camera zooms out. They are in a hot-air balloon the same color as the hot sunset. David’s voice is saying, “It’s so pretty here.” Girls’ voices are saying, “So pretty,” “So gorgeous.” Above them hangs a cratered afternoon moon. A brunette says, “He’s from, like, Planet Sexy!” Girls cry. David cries.  A blond girl says, “When I’m with David, the world just falls away.” A girl whose face is obscured growls. She says, “I want to make all of them disappear.” Before she told me I was anti-feminist, Dr. Linklater had a lot to say about how the couples—Ben and Becca O., Robert and Aimee P., Peter and Bekah L.—never last, and how it’s because they’re forced to speak in these preordained platitudes that, by virtue of cultural dribble-down, imperil the rest of us too. I told her we shouldn’t blame them, because you know those moments when they’re staring out at the sky above the ocean and saying things like so pretty, amazing, I’m ready, this journey, find love, late fiancé, single mom, last relationship, etc.? You know those moments you called “Orwellian-level deadness”? Those moments are when they’re seeing something so magical that they lose all the words they once knew. That thing is floating in the sky above the Java Sea. Like a UFO, maybe, or a distant galactic rock where the mysteries of truest love dwell. At least they saw it, I told her. Have you ever? Seen it? Have you ever looked out at the great space above a sea, or above a mountain, or above the teeth of a city skyline, or even above the asphalt in the parking lot of the salon where you work, and have you ever thought you saw something, something alien you could never put words to if you tried? And have you ever thought, I want to rocket there as fast as I can? If you saw even a flash of that galactic love meteor, what could you say? What would be good enough? Spoiler: When David’s limos rolled up on the first night, there were only 25 women. Not one was Asian. I went to Harry’s house for the premiere. He lived in a midtown loft overlooking the park, with exposed-brick walls and a blackboard by the kitchen where he wrote his grocery list in green chalk. He ate a lot of green things. Kale. Celery. Spring onions. Spirulina. Chard. Harry’s house was full of pictures of his dead mother, who was petite with disproportionately big breasts. I should say that I am petite with disproportionately big breasts. I have some northeast Indian in me, which means sometimes I am taken for Chinese or Thai. I will just say it. There is no way around it. I look a lot like Harry’s mother. I approached one of the images of her, mounted above the television, which turned out to be an oil painting. Her eyes were totally black. The painter had neglected to give them variation in color and light, so they looked like two buttons on an otherwise human face. Harry served gimlets and popped organic popcorn. He said he’d already had a few drinks before I arrived, he’d gotten nervous, he’d been wanting to ask me out for forever. He started talking and talking. It was endless, how much he had to say, as if the entire time he’d been asking me to talk while I plucked his eyebrows, he was biting his lip not from the pain of the plucking but from the pain of not speaking all these secrets. He pointed at the painting and told me that when his mother died, he had been at summer camp, lost in the woods during a game of something called Predator Versus Prey. He was the Prey. Right around the moment she died, he was being caught by the Predator, a huge white boy named Jimbo. He asked me about my parents, and I told him how my dad had left when I was a teenager and how my mom had gone back to India as soon as I moved out of the house, and she died there. I didn’t tell him about my mom joining the creepy ashram where she had to wear white all the time, or how when I talked to her on FaceTime, I could see her slowly departing, replaced by this intensely faithful devotee to something invisible. I prayed very hard to the gods she believed in when she decided to starve herself to death for fear of accruing new, bad karma. You go your whole life in America not knowing that starving to death is a thing people do, and then someone you love does it, and you become aware that a million imperceptible forces exist in the universe that compel people to do this. In my audition tape for The Bachelor, I had obviously not shared this information; I just said I’d lost my parents, because you have to let other people fill in the rest, so they see you as normal, lovable, fixable. “I’m so sorry about that,” he said. “You seem strong. Maybe because of it.” I nodded. Then I kissed him on his elbow when he lifted it to take a sip of his gimlet. I had one hand in the popcorn bowl and I squeezed it so that I touched all the popcorn, even the dead kernels at the bottom. “Why did you do that, on my elbow?” he lowered his drink. He didn’t seem mad. “You’re shy, aren’t you?” I am not shy. I am easily mistaken for shy. I nodded. He did the rest of the work. I felt vaporous, or like I didn’t exist. “Is it okay?” he asked, in the middle. Mostly. Then I looked at the clock. My head was dangling backwards over the arm of his sofa and I saw the red numbers on his microwave, upside down. “It’s going to start soon,” I whispered. “What?” He grunted. A bead of his sweat dripped onto my chin. “The show.” I snapped my head back up. He put his hand behind my neck, to cushion it. “Oh. You really want to watch the show?” His breath came very fast. I blinked very fast. “Don’t cry,” he said. He had one hand on my right breast. He moved the other one from my neck to my left breast and squeezed both. My head dropped upside down again. Watching Harry’s inverted kitchen was like floating the wrong way in antigravity. I felt nauseous. He seemed to be going faster, though I couldn’t feel very much. “I’m not crying,” I said as the blood rushed to my head. “But I want to watch the show.” “Fuck,” he said. “I lost it, anyway.” How many things could a person lose in a moment? This was one of the best messages of The Bachelor: In every moment lurks the possibility of great love but also great loss. If everyone saw this, everyone would live differently. They would take great risks for love, like going on television. They would demand more. A man I slept with for a while told me if I wasn’t careful, the world would never be enough for me. I said he was the one who should be careful. Harry went to the bathroom. While he was gone, I reached for the remote control and started the show. That was when I found out about the missing limousine. First night. Los Angeles, Bachelor mansion. Champagne sprinkles the air. The tongues. Everything seems to be giggling. The women, the house, the Southern California night.  Contestants: Twenty-one white, three Black, one Cuban woman. Fifteen blondes. Five brunettes. One redhead, dressed as a vampire in tribute to David’s first movies. Kelsey, 24, wedding-dress designer from Bend, Oregon, steals him first. They sit outside, tucked under a bright-green shag blanket. Other women are visible through the doorway, no longer giggling. The vampire chews her lip with the fake teeth. Someone points and shrieks. Fake blood drips down her chin. Kelsey, wearing a top hat, pulls a multicolored handkerchief from David’s ear.  David: Wow, that was like real magic! Kelsey (leaning forward): Well, now you know that I believe in magic. Do you? The near-kiss is interrupted by the vampire. She has taken off all her clothes except her black cape and is creeping up behind David. There are little blurred blobs in place of her undoubtedly perky boobs. She pops up when Kelsey is close enough to breathe on David’s nose. The vampire teeth connect with David’s neck. The vampire pulls back. The teeth do not come with her. They stick to David’s skin, they are so slick with fake blood. Kelsey screams. The women scream. David cracks up. The vampire gets the final rose that night. In the morning I called the brainy blogger/podcaster and asked if she was surprised that the all-Asian limo never showed. “What?” she said. “You sent me the footage,” I said. “Of the first limousine. When it was five Asians, and the host came out and shook David’s hand and was like, ‘We’re so excited to shine a spotlight on representation this season,’ remember?” “Oh. Yeah. Hm. They probably just filmed it as a teaser and found it didn’t test well or something. They cut people all the time, babe.” She panted. I could hear the roll and hum of exercise machines around her. I was locked in the supply closet at the salon between the huge tower of waxing strips and the courtesy tampons that we kept in the bathrooms. Outside, my brother was asking the other stylists where I was. I thought I remembered some of the missing women’s names. I recited them back to her. “I dunno, babe,” she said. Her breath slowed as she began walking on the treadmill. She glugged water. “Don’t you think you should do a post or an episode about it?” She sighed. “Look,” she said. “I went to Williams College. I like a sharp analysis of pop culture as much as the next person. But I’m not gonna do a whole episode on this. Dr. Linklater fucked up my downloads for a month. Maybe you should pitch a think piece or something.” My whole body felt dense, like concrete, like I was one of the walls of the storeroom. I hung up and searched my email for the footage I swore she’d sent me. I found nothing. Maybe she’d Snapchatted it? Or maybe I’d cleared my iPhoto? I couldn’t find social-media handles associated with any of the women I was sure were in the first limo. Perhaps I was wrong about their names. I clicked and clicked and clicked until my thumb cramped. A few people had written snarky posts about how The Bachelor shouldn’t be celebrated for casting an Asian man as the lead, how the airwaves could handle only one minority at a time: Did anyone else notice that the few nonwhite competitors got zero camera time? One writer said she’d heard reports that Asian women had signed up for the show but that ABC had canceled several contracts using the network’s new background-check system, so perhaps all those women had turned out to have DUIs or STIs. I found just one post on a blog I’d never heard of that seemed to recognize my reality. It was by a woman named Mrinalini Rangapadmanabhan. I did not envy her that name. She said she knew—for a fact—that five women of various Asian descents had signed on for David’s season. She said they had disappeared off the face of the planet. Fact-check her, she dared you: There were no missing-persons reports, no social-media evidence; no one had noticed these women being subsumed by the void, by aliens, by covert ops, by another dimension, by something wicked. She ended the post with: “CAN ANYONE FUCKING HEAR ME OUT THERE.” I clicked on the neon-green Contact me link, but then my brother pushed the door open so suddenly that a wall of super-absorbent tampons fell on me. “Avanti,” he said, waving the storeroom key. “What the fuck.” That day, I did a mani-pedi, several Brazilian waxes, a bunch of eyebrows, and Camrynn Hare’s entire face-threading. It turned out that all those years in high school, Camrynn had been waxing most parts of her body. As I spread witch hazel on her skin after, she said, “Aviva, I think you might need to let this one go.” “Let it go?” I had been talking to everyone, all day, about the missing limousine. These were clients with whom I always discussed The Bachelor. Most watched; those who didn’t enjoyed my recaps. “You’re starting to sound a little crazy,” she said. I wanted to hold up the hand mirror to her face and go, You look crazy, like a stripped peach pit. But that would have resulted in a damning Yelp review. “You always like The Bachelor,” I said in an even tone. “I like to gossip,” she said. “But I’m not interested in discussing existential things when I’m getting my face done.” “Existential?” She sighed and went to pay. She tipped me 12 percent and neglected to book her next appointment. That night I wrote to Mrinalini Rangapadmanabhan and told her I believed her. The Asian women had been ripped from the Earth. Aliens made sense to me. The next Monday, I drove to Harry’s house. He seemed surprised to find me at his door. “I only meant watch it that one time,” he said, but he let me in. I’d arrived 30 minutes early. As soon as he shut the door, I dropped to my knees and gave him a blow job. When he was done, I went to turn on his television with time to spare. I left him with his corduroy pants around his ankles in the front hallway. “You’re kind of insane, aren’t you?” he said, sitting next to me. Above the television was that portrait of his mother, still dead, still resembling me. I did not offer my opinion about his sanity. Instead I told him what I’d been saying to Camrynn Hare regarding the missing limousine, and I complained that she said I’d been talking too existentially. I had not heard back from Mrinalini Rangapadmanabhan. “I guess alien-abduction theories might strike some people as existential,” he chuckled. He poured two glasses of wine and placed the bottle on his dark wood coffee table. “My sister watches this with a bunch of girls,” he said. “Why don’t you do that?” “Like a ‘girls night.’” I used air quotes. “Yeah.” He grinned. “You have wine lips.” He licked his thumb and pressed it on my lips. It was a bothersome, effeminate, maternal gesture. I had briefly attended a watch group for one of the summer spin-offs at my brother’s girlfriend’s house. There was a lot of rosé and vegan baked goods that no one touched. I sat between a tall blond woman named Holly Greer and another tall blond woman named Molly Peele, and I mixed them up. People were cold to me after that. Also, I found it difficult to simultaneously track everything being said on the screen and in real life. These women jabbered over the events of the show; I don’t know how anyone would have been prepared for small talk during the following week. “I wouldn’t do that,” I said, edging away. “I wouldn’t have anything to talk about with women afterward, see.” “How come you feel like you’ve got nothing to say?” He reached for a stray lock of my hair and tugged on it hard. I wondered if he was going to ask me to choke him. I have had sex most ways. Here is my opinion about sex. Sex is a bunch of grunts and flails you make with your body and voice. It can be nice. But in my opinion it has little to do with the things you say when you look into the sky and all the good words are lost. The show was starting. I asked him to please be quiet. I began to sleep over at Harry’s on Monday nights after the show. “Do you ever feel like something has just swooped down to Earth and stolen your words?” I said, during week seven, after sex. “Like your aliens?” He smirked. “I guess. Sometimes. But if aliens came here and the best they could do was steal my lines, I’d think that was a waste of a trip.” “That’s what I feel like,” I said. “You asked me why I don’t have enough to say.” “Hm,” he said. “Well. What’s one thing you always want to say but can’t?” This was why I did not date much. I hated the risky, slow striptease, revealing everything about yourself, only to wind up exposed and cold in an icy wood, so to speak, when the other person decided they’d seen enough. Out there, alone, freezing, naked, you looked around and wondered if anyone had been watching the whole time. It seemed better to love in neat phrases or in silence, gazing out at a sapphire sea, with a camera as witness. That way, even if your lover didn’t properly comprehend you, 8 million to 12 million viewers might. I put my ear to Harry’s shirtless chest and looked out his bedroom window at the night. You can’t see stars from homes like Harry’s, because of the city lights. “Hey. I can’t tell if you’re asleep.” He shook me and my bare breasts flopped. “Earth to Avanti?” “I’m not asleep,” I said. “And I’m not shy.” “That’s what you always want to say?” “What?” “That you’re not shy?” I lay back down on his chest. “Yeah,” I said. “Do you like my view?” he whispered. He started to massage my head. At first his nails felt like bird’s feet scrabbling along my scalp, but then it felt nice, and I felt bad, because he had been so clear about the shape of all his loss and I was letting him slot me in even though I knew I couldn’t fit. Obligingly, I considered his view. I saw only skyscrapers. The one that looks like a perfectly sharpened pencil. The one that looks like the head of a parasaurolophus dinosaur. I nodded sure, he had a cool view. My head knocked against his chin. I did not say it was pretty or amazing. I couldn’t give him that. Fantasy suites. Thailand. David and the vampire redhead, now known as Melissa, 27, small-business owner, Salem, Massachusetts, are in a hot tub. One-on-one, Melissa is gentler. Good at letting David in on her vulnerability: Every man she has ever been with has cheated on her. This information has made her a fan favorite. Melissa: I was made to feel like I wasn’t enough for them. That’s why I became such a big personality. David: That whole journey, it brought you here. David lifts her out of the hot tub, carries her toward the fantasy suite. There is a risk. That she is not enough for David, either. But she takes the risk. Because the invisible, loving, omnipresent gaze of Bachelor Nation is saying, “You are more than enough. For us.” In the morning, David leans on his forearms on the bamboo balcony while someone totes in Danish leaking blood-colored jelly. Melissa curls up in a ball in bed behind him, wearing glasses and a pajama tank top, braless. The camera doesn’t linger on David’s face, which viewers have memed on social media by covering it with a question-mark emoji to indicate enigma. Instead the camera brushes over his abs and lands on Melissa, her hot-red hair flaring over her shoulders, her eyes pooling. The night of the finale, I went over to Harry’s as usual. I no longer spoke with clients about The Bachelor. Harry was my final companion in franchise consumption. He told me he had joined an office betting pool. “It’s me and a bunch of women,” he laughed, handing me a bottle of white wine from the fridge. The condensation chilled my hands. I drank straight from it. No popcorn, not since the first night. “Don’t be jealous, though,” he added, bringing his warm breath to my cheek. “They’re all moms and stuff.” I sat on the floor in front of him as the episode began. He was doing that hair-scratching thing as I leaned against his bony knees. Kelsey was crying and Melissa was crying. I was getting drunk and Harry’s hands were moving down my neck and drumming on my collarbone. “Wait,” I said, when one of his hands moved toward my breast. “Sorry,” he said. “I know you don’t like to be distracted, during.” “No, just wait,” I said. Melissa was crying and David was crying and Kelsey was crying and even the host was tearing up as David sat across from him and worried aloud that some part of him would always be lodged in the girl he dumped that day. And then, as Kelsey stepped into a tiny rowboat to cross the blue lagoon to the island where David stood, alone, in a blue tux, surrounded by swans and yellow daffodils, I got up and straddled Harry. “What’s going to happen?” he said, craning to see. “She got there first,” I said. “Which means he dumps her and proposes to Melissa.” I started to fiddle with the zipper on his jeans. He wiggled out of them, still on the couch, his mouth slack. “Within minutes?” My lips were on his inner thigh. “What?” I said into his skin, which was sweaty and pungent. “He dumps one and proposes to the other in, like, the same half hour?” “Love is about extremes,” I said. I lay on my back on Harry’s soft alpaca rug and pulled him onto me. “Now just wait,” I said, when he went for my skirt. “Wait?” “Until Melissa gets there.” He was pantsless and underpantsless, kneeling above fully clothed me, and I was turning my head a little awkwardly and watching David watch Kelsey approach. I was watching David accidentally drop to one knee in front of Kelsey, watching him shake his head like he’d been possessed, watching him admit that he’d been horribly confused. I was watching Kelsey punch the camera so hard that blood sprinkled the lens, watching her suck her hand like a self-cannibalizing vampire, watching her sprint away, holding her stilettos, bawling as she entered the black SUV that would take her to the airport. I was watching so closely that I didn’t feel the heat of Harry recede from me. I noticed only when Melissa arrived and I reached for Harry’s body—I had timed it all, so carefully—and I found that he was gone. I made do alone. I watched David and Melissa say yes, yes, yes, love, love, love, while my breathing got fast and then I went home without saying goodbye. David and Melissa broke up on Ellen, in front of 4 million viewers. Melissa took out her final rose and started chewing each petal and then even the stem shorn of thorns and then attempted to swallow the princess-cut Neil Lane engagement ring while shouting, “No one will ever be enough for you, you jerk,” while Ellen bounced on her toes and cried, “Hey, hey, guys, be kind to each other!” After that night, after the tabloids declared that David was hot for the host, after the host sued them, after some of the bloggers finally started to note that there had been a sixth limousine that never showed, and wondered if David P. Li was self-hating and canceled the Asian contestants so he could successfully assimilate into white American society … after all that, David P. Li vanished. People said he got plastic surgery in Korea. People said he moved to a part of the world where no one had seen the vampire movies or his blockbuster or The Bachelor or Ellen. People said he’d been kidnapped and killed by a crazy fan; people said all kinds of things about crazy fans. People said he’d always been shallow; hadn’t anyone noticed? There were the Bermuda Triangle theories. There was the suicide cover-up hypothesis. I don’t talk to people about my theories, because I don’t want to be accused of being existential. I now discuss only the properties of hair follicles and clogged pores with customers; these topics cause people to believe I am a salon savant uninterested in chitchat. My Yelp reviews are adequate. All talk is small. But. Just the other day, I did something. I posted a video to YouTube. Like those radio waves we broadcast into the cosmos in case any aliens are trying to get in touch. Season 12, audition tape, unedited. Salon storeroom.  Behind me, a white plaster wall; edging the corners of the frame, piles of cosmetic wipes and aesthetician’s thread and waxing strips and those courtesy tampons. My hair, straightened, brushes my breasts; I’ve worn a lacy bralette that peekaboos through a plunging neckline because I’m not stupid; I understand how this works. I speak into my laptop camera. Avanti, 24, aesthetician/Bachelor superfan, Decatur, Georgia. I spend all day trying to make people their most beautiful selves. It’s so important to me to try to make life as beautiful as possible. My parents aren’t around anymore. Family is so important. I have trouble opening up, because I know what it feels like to lose people. I am very afraid to have someone just disappear out of my life again, but with the right person, I’d be willing to take a leap of faith—hang on— My brother knocks on the door a bunch of times, but I sit there silently. He says my name over and over, says he knows I’m in there, says I’ve got five minutes before I need to come back out. The knocking recedes. I adjust my bralette and sit back and for a second my picture freezes and I wave my hands to test whether it’s still recording, whether anything is there, in the machine, looking back at me. ​"

        "story": "Patty’s murder happened on a Tuesday afternoon in June, overcast and cool. You needed a sweater if you were going to work in the yard. It was 1966, a small town in Windham County, Connecticut. Milkweed and moths at screens, fields of corn and goldenrod and Queen Anne’s lace. There were woods behind her new house, a cape, and small animals emerging from the shadows to scamper over the clover. Wood thrush, wind in trees. That summer, ants formed a long, narrow line from the corner of the counter, down the lower cabinets to the linoleum. Patty woke that morning to the needs of her family—a husband heading off to work, a recently potty-trained toddler. The radio played softly in the kitchen, WPOP Top 40. You could smell oranges. She stood at the sink and looked out the window into the backyard. She might have imagined the day her daughter would play there and how she would call her in to supper through the screen. The window over the sink let in the smell of summer grass and eased the drudgery of dishwashing. Her husband always had coffee and toast. He ate in the living room and read the paper. He’d come in late last night and hadn’t seen his daughter or his wife before they went to bed. He worked as an accountant with a manufacturing company a half hour’s drive away and was often out late. We can only guess what was said between them in these final moments. Was he apologetic and reassuring? Did he thank his wife as she handed him his plate of toast? Did she remind him that things needed taking care of? The house he’d built for them wasn’t entirely complete. There was the deck out back without a railing or stairs, missing kitchen cabinets. Did she harp? Or did nothing at all pass between them that morning but resentment and silence? He left at 8:15, the same time every morning. Briefcase, freshly ironed dress shirt, tie. He took his daughter into his arms and said goodbye. Any other wife, watching, might have felt joy at this show of love, a small twinge of jealousy that she was excluded. If she’d been sharp and angry with him, she might have felt regret. If she’d been silent, she might have expected it to result in something more, the way we notice an absence and remark on it—didn’t there used to be a chair over there? In that corner? But Patty wasn’t like other wives. He descended the front walk and started up the Buick and drove off down the quiet country road, and Patty would’ve listened to the sound of the car coming in through that pretty kitchen window and felt relief. Then, her mother-in-law would have come down the stairs, a heavy-footed thumping. Doris lived upstairs in an apartment her son had built for her. She used to work as a nanny for a family in the next town, but she’d been let go recently and hadn’t found another position. Doris often stood on the bottom stair as if some invisible shield blocked her from the rest of the house. Patty would get a whiff of the peculiar smell of her—lavender and mothballs. “He was out with that woman again last night,” Doris might have said. Her voice, usually assertive, sounded like a child’s. The lost job, the strange voice—when her mother-in-law went off, she often behaved this way, and Patty’s only recourse was to avoid her. Let him deal with his own mother, she told me. Ignoring Doris meant that the woman would slip back upstairs. She had her own small kitchen, a sitting area, a bedroom. She had food and books, her yarn and her crochet hook—everything she needed in her own apartment. Days with a young child are dependent on routine. Patty’s mother had cautioned her to stick to a plan. Things had been difficult after the child was born, and Patty had left her husband and taken the infant to her parents’ house. People said Patty was the nervous type—too thin, not very attractive—but I disagree. Her dark hair was smooth and lovely. She wore light-blue-framed glasses, cat-eye and stylish. Back then, it was more acceptable to be a softer woman—softness was associated with friendliness. I think people at the local grocery store judged her for her behavior after the child was born. She became nervous and unattractive in their eyes because she didn’t know how to be happy, to make a proper family. She wore a knit top that day, the imprint found in the blood on the kitchen floor where she’d briefly lain. Mornings, Patty often called me to arrange a playdate. I lived across the street—our house set far enough back off the country road that we had our privacy. Sometimes her little girl, Debbie, came to my house, but that day, I sent Henry over to hers. Henry was older than Debbie by two years, but he was still a preschooler, and they played well together. The playdate always lasted until 11:45, when Patty sent Henry home, and she prepared lunch for her daughter, fed her, and put her in her crib for her nap. Nap time is the mainstay of daily life with a child. You are able, in the middle of the afternoon, to spend a whole guilt-free hour or more alone. The laundry can be folded into neat piles, the dishes done. I still sent Henry to his room for quiet time, even at nearly 5 years old, when he no longer napped. He was not allowed to leave his room until quiet time was over—a rule he always followed. Sometimes, I admit, I slipped out of the house and went for walks in the woods—brief ones. I needed them for my sanity. I was five months pregnant, not yet prepared for another child in the house. I felt like the astronauts they showed on television, strapped into their upward-facing seats, awaiting the countdown. Patty never missed her daytime television programs. Search for Tomorrow, The Guiding Light, As the World Turns. The baby went down and she could watch while ironing, and it is believed from the blood spatter that she was ironing her husband’s dress shirts when she was attacked. That day, Henry told me that while he and Debbie were playing, Doris came back downstairs. She sat silently in a chair in the corner, offered to make Patty and Debbie lunch. “Let me do it,” she said. I imagined her odd, high voice. “I can make you tuna salad.” Patty said Debbie didn’t like tuna. “Just go back upstairs,” she said. Henry told me that Doris did not leave, that she continued to sit there in the corner watching them. At 11:45 I saw him cross their front yard through our picture window and I went outside to meet him, to bring him in for his own lunch. I often tried to imagine the scene at Patty’s—what happened after with Doris. Patty told me that the woman frightened her, that something wasn’t right. The year before Doris came to live with them, she had been behaving strangely—saying nonsensical things, wandering from home, threatening to hurt herself—and she’d been placed in the state psychiatric hospital. “She was released from the hospital,” I said to Patty, trying to reassure her. “The doctors wouldn’t do that unless she was better.” Patty pressed her lips together, wrung her hands. “You don’t understand,” she said. “No one listens to me.” But Doris and I had chatted on the front lawn evenings, and she seemed levelheaded and kind—someone you could ask how to lift a mustard stain, or when to search for morels in our woods. She baked us a blueberry pie that summer. I told Patty she was overreacting, that the woman simply wanted to spend time with her granddaughter. “Let me take her up with me to play. Just for a little while,” Doris often said. And sometimes Patty relented, but perhaps that day she believed her afternoon would be ruined, and when her daughter whined to go to her grandmother, Patty refused. “She won’t go down for her nap then,” she might have said, taking the girl into her arms. Here, Doris might have given Patty one of her off looks. Patty described it to me once as a vacant-eyed stare—as if the woman who had been there had gone, and someone else had stepped into her body. It reminded her of the mounted animal heads on one of her old boyfriend’s living-room walls. “They look at you and they’re dead,” she’d said. “But it’s as if they know they’re dead.” At the bottom of the stairwell, Doris might have paused. “Please.” She wore a skirt and blouse—the blouse tucked in and a cloth belt cinched around her thick waist. Her hair was styled into tight gray curls. Patty would ignore her, knowing from her expression that she was already resigned. Maybe Doris said, “It’s not my fault he’s a cheat.” And, “It wasn’t me who made him that way.” Weak sun, the windows open. Smell of cut wood from the unfinished deck and spray starch. The voices of television characters whose lives were complicated by affairs and disappearances and villains with ulterior motives, and rarely involved dishes or ironing or putting children down for naps. A child who had become more and more difficult, one Dr. Spock warned may soon be giving up the long afternoon nap altogether. Patty clung to these quiet hours, refused to let anything disturb them. Even her daughter, who may have been calling to her from her crib in the bedroom down the hall, her tiny voice perhaps the last thing Patty heard while ironing. The murder scene was described to me by my husband. The police kept quiet in their search for a suspect and only a few details—fork, electrical cord—were leaked by the local paper. Patty’s husband arrived home after work, a day spent the way most were—lunch with his co-workers from a truck that pulled into the loading dock each day, a departure from the office at 5 o’clock. Because he’d been out late the night before, he arrived promptly at 5:30. He noticed things were different; the front door was unlocked when Patty always kept it locked. His daughter was usually at the front bay window, awaiting his arrival—perhaps placed there by Patty to welcome him, to remind him of his responsibility as a father. The window was empty that day. Patty didn’t believe that her husband was seeing another woman. She said that it was his mother’s idea, that Doris had told her a story of meeting the girl once. “She’s prettier than you,” Doris had said. “I like her better.” I was surprised that Doris would say such a thing. But I couldn’t tell Patty the woman was crazy if I’d spent so much time telling her she wasn’t. I asked instead how she and her husband were getting along. “He’s left me alone,” Patty said. “Thankfully.” After the baby, her husband had tried to initiate sex and Patty had said it was too soon. He had insisted and forced himself on her anyway. Patty had taken the infant and gone to her parents’ house; she wanted a divorce, but he refused to grant one. It was a condition of her return that he leave her alone. That she didn’t want to be touched. “He thinks I’ll change my mind,” Patty said. “But I won’t.” I might have offered her advice, suggested that she see things from her husband’s point of view, but when I tried to imagine my own husband ignoring my wishes, pinning me down to the bed and prying my legs apart, I could not. I admired her resolve in a way. “But don’t you love him?” I asked her. She stared at me, and I thought I could see what she meant about Doris’s look—I saw it happen to Patty just then. It was as if someone else had stepped in behind her eyes and was looking back at me. “Love him?” she said bitterly. Suddenly I knew why people didn’t like her. The existence of the other woman came out during the trial. By then Patty’s husband had married her and moved to another state. Asked about her in court, he offered mumbled replies. The transcript repeatedly makes note of the judge’s insistence that he speak up. And maybe, asked to recount the details of a long-running affair, the discovery of his wife’s body that day, he was mortified. Not many people return from work to such a scene—pools of blood on the kitchen linoleum, a smeared trail of it leading out the sliding glass doors and across the new deck, and Patty’s body below on the ground, an electrical cord wrapped around her neck. He ran immediately to our house—the only house within two miles of theirs. I was serving a casserole for dinner when he came to the door; the panic made him incomprehensible. He said he didn’t know where Debbie was. My husband left the table and accompanied Patty’s husband to the house, and they ran around to the backyard thinking his little girl had wandered off into the woods. That was a fear we all had—our children disappearing into the woods. When I was a child, we frightened one another with stories of the Old Leatherman. My grandmother told me he had a cave in our woods, one of many throughout the state where he stayed overnight on his circuit of the towns. “You could set a clock by his arrival,” she said. He was a beggar who spoke a garbled French. He had sewn himself a suit of leather he wore year-round—even a leather cap. As a child, she and her friends had found his cave by a running brook, discovered his stores of hickory nuts and dried berries and implements he must have used to start a fire, to dig. We were frightened of the man, but we sought his cave anyway—long days spent in the woods, looking for the running stream. The Old Leatherman was long dead. My husband found Patty’s body on the ground below the deck in the backyard. Later, he told me his first instinct was to cover her, as if a brutal death is like nakedness, something shameful. He went inside and asked for a blanket and Patty’s husband was in the kitchen pouring a whiskey. Traipsing through all that blood with his glass. “Would you like a drink? I need a drink,” he said. My husband, in shock himself, accepted. “Where’s the baby?” he asked. And Patty’s husband went to the foot of the stairs and called to his mother. I’d been planting annuals in my front yard that afternoon, and later I had a direct view of Patty’s house through my front window, and I saw nothing. No sign of forced entry. It was a small town, and few cars traveled the road. Only one was seen in the vicinity—a black Ford driven by a teenager, a friend of the family. The witness said the car was parked in front of Patty’s house. It could not have been there long—I would have seen it. I pass our bay window all day long. Coming up from the basement with laundry, I see Patty’s house. Vacuuming the living-room rug, dusting the tables. Even from my kitchen table I can see out my front window. I didn’t see the black car, so I took issue with anyone saying it was there. The woman who claims she saw it must have been confused, I told my husband. She thought she was on Vesper Lane, not Schoolhouse Road. But later, I admitted it was only after Patty was dead that my focus narrowed on her house. I was preoccupied that day—I might have never once looked out toward Patty’s. It wasn’t my habit to imagine what she was doing. I assumed she did what we all did back then—chopped vegetables for dinner, scrubbed the tubs and sinks, washed and folded clothing. That she was murdered while ironing wasn’t a surprise. If the murderer had slipped across to my house, what might I have been caught doing? If the Old Leatherman had still been around, he would have been a likely suspect. But the newspapers chose the teenager driving his father’s black car. The prosecutor claimed that his sexual fantasies, repressed by his strict religious upbringing, drove him to enter the home of his friends and commit murder. This boy went to trial and could not even recount the events of that afternoon. He might have stopped by to pick up a Pyrex dish his mother had loaned Patty, he said. Maybe the door was unlocked, and he went inside. Maybe the baby was crying and there was blood on the kitchen floor. Perhaps he followed the trail to the deck, peered over the edge to glimpse the body, and fled, horror erasing everything he’d seen—a defense mechanism, his attorney claimed. My husband never could forget. He prayed at night that the image of Patty sprawled in the patchy grass would fade, but even now, years later, it has not. He reaches for the bourbon, as if that evening with Patty’s husband, the two of them sipping from their glasses on the front stoop, triggered some alternate version of my husband, a man who’d rarely taken a drink before, to emerge. And when he’s had a drink, he’ll often return to that evening—how Doris came to the top of the stairs, holding Debbie in her arms, and called down to them: “Is she dead yet?” Doris was questioned. Her replies were given in the high, childlike voice she’d recently adopted. She’d heard nothing unusual, she said. The baby was crying in her crib and she brought her upstairs. She didn’t know where Patty was. She heard a loud, thumping sound. She had seen a strange car in the driveway. She brought Debbie upstairs with her to play. It was determined she should be taken back to the state mental hospital for evaluation. Later, it was said she was too slight of build to have staged the attack. She had no motive to hurt Patty. And then she got cancer and died in the hospital and there were no more opportunities for questioning. For answers. The town wanted the suspect caught so they could go back to leaving their doors unlocked, take their walks in the woods again in peace. The summer night, filled with the sound of katydids and crickets, became a space they awoke to jolted by fear. Patty’s husband and Doris were longtime residents. Doris’s former employers attested to her diligence and care in their households, as if they’d forgotten that her hospitalization had been cause for dismissal. She was a jewel, they said. The children loved her so. When it was proved that the teenager accused of the crime was elsewhere at the time Patty was killed, he was exonerated. He left town as soon as he was able, and many still assumed this was proof of his guilt and were grateful. The idea of a murderer living among us is almost like my childish pursuit of the Old Leatherman. Why continue to believe in things that terrify us? Since that summer afternoon, my husband and I have occasionally indulged in a speculative game. It starts when the bourbon comes out and he recounts finding Patty. We both have our theories. I suggest that Patty’s husband, desperate to be with the woman he loved, hired someone to come through the sliding doors from the deck. They found a ladder propped up where the steps would have been. “Why not ask for a divorce?” my husband says. “There was the stigma then, of course, but the alternative?” “He was too stubborn to grant one,” I tell him. “He was prideful.” “Resentment is a breeding ground for fury,” my husband says, his eyes glassy. Which brings us to Doris. “She just wanted to spend time with the baby,” I say. “She felt left out, not irremediably wronged.” My husband likes to settle on Doris. No one was seen coming to or from the house. Doris had been institutionalized. “The insane often have superhuman strength.” He tips the bourbon into his empty glass. It is summer and we are out on our own deck. Our children, school-aged now and manageable, are safe in bed. The fireflies bobble and dip, drunk in the expanse of the backyard, sometimes appearing close enough to startle me. I warn my husband not to let one in the house. My grandmother used to say a firefly in the house meant someone was going to die. “We both knew Doris,” I say. “We ate her pie, took cuttings from her garden.” “Patty was stabbed with a fork,” my husband says. The porch light draws beetles that ping against the screen door. I scrape my chair back and flip the light off and we blend into the shadows and become strangers. “The electrical cord,” I say. “It would have had to have been ripped out.” “I watched that woman dig boulders out of their front lawn with her bare hands,” my husband says. “A toaster cord would’ve been nothing.” “She knew where the knives were kept,” I say. “Why not use one?” My husband believes it was a spontaneous act, not something planned. Kitchen utensils might have been on the table, drying in the rack beside the sink. He is quick to pin Doris as the suspect, to assume that her mental illness made her violent. Doris with her belted skirt, her curled hair and soft hands crocheting blankets. “Suppose Patty had a lover,” I say. All these years, I have kept quiet. I hear the strain of the chair’s slats as my husband leans back. “That boy was nowhere near the house. They proved that.” His voice holds a trace of irritation. “Not him, another man,” I say. “He’d been showing up during the baby’s nap time, climbing the ladder Patty propped up to the deck, coming to the sliding door.” “What man?” my husband says. “That’s far-fetched.” “Her husband had a lover; why not Patty? Why is it so hard to believe?” “Why would no one have noticed a car?” “He might have parked on the state road and come through the path in the woods.” And then Doris was home, let go from her job. Things became complicated. The lover showed up and was turned away. I hear my husband’s breathing change. The sound of a cornered, panting animal. I imagine the shine of its eyes and the animal heads Patty talked about, their knowing. “All right,” he says, up for the game, sliding forward in his chair. “Say there’s a love interest. Say he’s impatient. They argue. He forces his way in; they struggle.” I can tell he’s upset. He tips his bourbon back and the ice slides around in his glass. I remember that evening, standing on the lawn and listening to the ice in their glasses as we waited for the police to arrive, Patty’s body around back eventually covered with a plaid wool throw, her eyes open beneath it. I felt the baby flutter and placed my hand on my stomach. There, there, I thought. My husband was altered, his face gone white, his shoulders slumped, no longer the youthful, athletic figure I’d seen those last few weeks slipping through the woods, scaling the ladder. I’d called my mother to pick up Henry. I didn’t want him to witness what happened after—the police in and out of our house, the pots of coffee, the questions, the careful accounting of my day. Tonight, we head to bed and beyond our bay window I can just make out the lights of the new subdivision. They tore down Patty’s house a few years ago. A developer bought the land and the woods and now it is an enclave of modern homes—all glass and stone and cantilevered rooflines. Houses built up into the woods where the Old Leatherman’s cave sits. Fields groomed into neat lawns. My knees ache. My palms tingle. I hear him stumble in the bedroom, banging his shin. I hear his soft groan as he settles on the bed, ever the impatient love interest, still mourning Patty. The past remains bottomless, a dark lake from which we drink. I have tricked him into imagining himself the murderer out of spite. All these years blaming Doris, and he is only partly right—Patty’s murder was a woman’s crime. The fork, the cord. The iron cord, not the toaster. A table fork first. These were the things at our daily disposal. Dish towel, oven mitt, apron, phone book, salt and pepper shakers, ashtray. Meat fork. We made our use of them as needed, need driving us to their use."

        "story": "Nessa was sitting in Hadi’s car, letting the AC run with the engine off, thinking that if the battery died, it served him right for taking so long in the pharmacy, and surveying the main street of Bayfield, which was nearly deserted even on a sunny summer morning, when whom did she see approaching the discount rack outside the clothing boutique but Alice Munro? At least, she was pretty sure it was Alice Munro. The past few years, Nessa had developed a habit, no matter where she found herself, whether on the subway in Toronto or strolling along a Venetian canal on vacation with her mother, of seeing strangers in the distance and mistaking them for Alice Munro. Sometimes they weren’t even women, just smallish men, old-timers with silky white hair and a comportment that recalled the hard-bitten grace she associated with Alice Munro. Whenever she reported these sightings to Hadi, he accused her of being obsessed with Alice Munro. “Alice Munro, always Alice Munro! How long will it be before a day goes by without you mentioning Alice Munro?” He spoke at least partly in jest, knowing it was hard for Nessa to avoid the topic when she was writing her Ph.D. dissertation on Alice Munro. Or, rather, on the works of Alice Munro. Nessa usually made a face when other academics used the name of the author—who was a real person, after all—to stand in for the author’s writing, saying, for instance, “I work on Alice Munro,” which made it sound as if they weren’t literary scholars but chiropractors, and ones with a poor sense of chiropractor-client privilege, overeager to share the fact that they got to crack some serious celebrity back, including the Nobel Prize–winning vertebrae of one Alice Munro. Hadi didn’t like it when Nessa referred to Bayfield as territory, making it sound as though the town was no more than literary real estate belonging to Alice Munro. He’d grown up in Bayfield, and by his account, the experience hadn’t been easy, so that the only thing he claimed to want from the place at this stage of his life was to feel that it had furnished material for his own writing, because he was a poet, and a very good one, but still, in the few interviews he’d given, most of them conducted by fellow graduate students, whenever the topic of his formative years came up, the interviewer inevitably wanted to know whether he’d been influenced by Alice Munro. Had he read Alice Munro? Had he met Alice Munro? Given this pattern of questioning, it seemed bad luck that he’d ended up housemates, besties, and occasional fuck buddies with someone whose sole scholarly commitment was to the writing of Alice Munro. “Besties and fuck buddies is fine,” he’d told Nessa, “so long as you don’t expect me to spend the holidays with you and your mother or do anything else that might falsely imply an interest in contracting myself to a secondhand involvement in Alice Munro.” He was always like this, cool and standoffish, which was strange, because he was a poet, and along with his proclivity for talking about things like boustrophedon and lipograms, Nessa would have expected him to be more forthcoming about matters of the heart, which surely weren’t the exclusive bailiwick of Alice Munro. Instead, he seemed happiest talking shop, even when it involved Nessa’s research, though he expressed nothing but disdain for the short stories of Alice Munro. “Don’t you feel,” he’d once said, “that all her characters are basically, in the end, versions of Alice Munro?” “Basically, in the end,” Nessa had replied, “we’re all versions of Alice Munro.” Despite Hadi’s dislike of Munro, he’d been obliging when it came to giving Nessa rides to Bayfield on weekends, even though his mother and sister had moved away from the town not long after he’d left for university, and even though his sole remaining relative in the place was his father, for whom he betrayed perhaps even less affection than he did for Alice Munro. His father, who owned Bayfield’s only pharmacy, apparently didn’t betray much affection for Hadi, either; at least the way Hadi told it, that was not because the man disapproved of Hadi’s lifestyle, given that he didn’t know about the drugs and alcohol, but because as an undergraduate, Hadi had jumped ship from biochemistry to the slowly leaking dinghy that was English literature, and because he kept company with people who investigated not cures for cancer or compostable plastics but Alice Munro. Nessa had met Hadi’s father only twice, and briefly on each occasion, but now that she thought of it, she was struck that he probably saw her as symbolizing everything distasteful about his son’s life, and she wondered if this might be why Hadi kept bringing her to Bayfield, not just because, as she kept impressing on him, she was jonesing for a meet-cute with Alice Munro. Over the past two years, various individuals, some of them good friends and some of them people she’d met minutes earlier at parties, had suggested to her that she consider developing an interest in authors other than Alice Munro. The only time she’d taken the suggestion seriously was at a book launch in Toronto the previous fall, when it had been proposed that she take a look at the work of Michael Ondaatje, but the suggestion had been made by Ondaatje, who seemed biased, and also, he was, no matter how many good things one could say about the man and his books, no Alice Munro. As Nessa stared at the woman checking out dresses that nobody else had wanted to buy all summer, she started to doubt whether it was actually Alice Munro. Exiting the car seemed the way to know for sure, and Nessa needed to move fast if she was going to have a chance, but she hesitated, daunted by the possibility that she was about to meet Alice Munro. What did you say to Alice Munro? Maybe, after all of Nessa’s yearning for this moment, it wasn’t right to meet her, not if Nessa aspired to be a proper literary critic, someone who wouldn’t let her personal feelings about authors impede her assessments of their work, someone who could stay objective and speak the unvarnished truth about literature by anybody, whether some anonymous medieval shepherd or, well, Alice Munro. But what the hell; how often did you sit in a car and see Alice Munro? She opened the passenger door as quietly as she could, keen not to spook Alice Munro. Jesus, what was she thinking; it wasn’t a deer, it was Alice Munro. And oh my God, it really was Alice Munro. As the woman stood at the discount rack, rubbing the sleeve of a gingham dress between her thumb and forefinger, Nessa could see the piercing blue eyes and cocked eyebrow that she had, some time ago, come to think of as a distinguished combination, because anyone lucky enough to have them thereby looked rather like Alice Munro. Unsure of what her opening move would be, Nessa decided just to walk up and improvise her first-ever words to Alice Munro. It still seemed unfathomable that Munro could be standing there, bargain-hunting for wardrobe refreshers, living an ordinary life, or at least one as ordinary as life could be if you were Alice Munro. “Excuse me,” said Nessa, “but are you Alice Munro?” “Alice Munro?” replied Alice Munro. “Fucksake, do I look like Alice Munro?” As she said it, she winked, and though her choice of phrasing had been unexpected, her eyes shone exactly like the all-observant eyes of Alice Munro. “Well yes, a little,” said Nessa, winking back and trying for the same ironic tone that had just been modeled for her by the one true Alice Munro. “Yeah, I know, I’m fucking with you,” said Alice Munro. “You’re the third tourist this week to tell me I look like Alice Munro.” “Wait,” said Nessa, “are you saying you aren’t Alice Munro?” Before there was time for an answer, Hadi called out a greeting that seemed intended less for Nessa than for the woman, who, with each passing second, began to fill out around the middle, and whose hair began ever so slightly to darken, looking less and less like Alice Munro’s. “Hadi!” said the woman, and suddenly Nessa felt that this person had sure as hell better not be Munro, because Nessa didn’t think that any part of her and Hadi’s relationship—not the friendship, the housemateship, or the fuckbuddyship—could survive the discovery that all this time, he’d been on a first-name basis with Alice Munro. “Hey, Mrs. Irvine,” said Hadi, going to hug her, and now Nessa didn’t know what she’d been thinking, so little did the woman actually resemble Alice Munro. “Hadi, you’re so grown up, I barely recognized you,” said the woman who was now very obviously not Alice Munro. “Did you know,” she said, turning to Nessa, “that this young man once wrote the best high-school essay I ever graded—and, the subject, as a matter of fact—” “Let me guess,” said Nessa with a scowl, “it was Alice Munro.” “Yes, Alice Munro! Hadi, would you believe that this young woman just mistook me for Alice Munro?” “Would you believe that she’s writing a Ph.D. dissertation on Alice Munro?” said Hadi, appearing eager to divert attention from what Mrs. Irvine had just revealed about his secret history with Alice Munro. “A whole dissertation on her,” said Mrs. Irvine in wonder, as if she figured you could get, at most, a chapter from the topic, maybe two if you considered the influence of Shakespeare on Alice Munro. “In my day,” she said, “it wasn’t an option to study Canadian literature, much less Alice Munro.” “Mrs. Irvine,” said Hadi, “I’d love to chat, and I appreciate, honestly, what you said about my paper on Alice Munro. But, in fact, Nessa here has been keen to meet her, and I’ve just found out from my father that tonight, we’re going to be having drinks at his place with, drumroll please—” “For Christ’s sake,” said Nessa, “don’t tell me it’s Alice Munro.” Hadi broke into a grin and nodded, triumphantly mouthing the paired words of confirmation, somehow as startling as they were familiar: Alice Munro. You’ve been selling drugs to Alice Munro for 40 years. That’s what you say to people when the chance presents itself to you. It’s a violation of the pharmacist’s code for you to tell people she’s a customer, but you say she probably wouldn’t mind, because you don’t identify which drugs have been involved, and anyhow, the joke is one that she herself first made to you. You were surprised the first time she turned up at the store, because she doesn’t live in Bayfield and there’s a perfectly serviceable pharmacy in Clinton. You aren’t a fan of that place yourself, because its inventory doesn’t match yours, and because the owner always calls you Mr. Nazem, knowing very well that’s your first name, not your last, and knowing well enough, too, that the nickname annoys the hell out of you. In fact, you wonder whether it was the man’s assholery that brought Munro’s business to you. It wasn’t, however, her stated reason, the first time she approached you. Just back from a trip to Australia, voice gravelly from strep throat, she explained that she’d found herself saddled by a certain renown because of writing books, an outcome that was fine and lucky in its way but sometimes inconvenient, and although she knew that pharmacists were supposed to be discreet, she thought it best, to safeguard her privacy, if she were to fill prescriptions outside of Clinton, in Bayfield, with you. You swore never to betray her. You must have promised something similar to Mama on your wedding day. You once told me that she and you exchanged no vows, just repeated three times that you accepted each other, but I bet the imam at least wrangled a promise to be faithful out of you. You must have done some thinking on the promise, if not that day, then later. You must have felt like shit about yourself. How many times did you cheat on Mama before she caught you? You made it seem like you were the virtuous one by agreeing to couples counseling. Mama didn’t want Nabila and me to know that the two of you were going, but you went ahead and told us anyhow, as if expecting us to praise you. I wonder, though: Did anything the counselor say get through to you? I guess there was that one time, after I walked in on Mama in the kitchen, shouting at you. After she’d gone upstairs, you explained to me how, according to the counselor, when you’re fighting with your spouse, they’re liable to fly into a rage if they hear themselves being described by you. “You should always start your sentences with ‘I,’ not ‘You,’” you told me, in a tone apparently intended to suggest hard-earned wisdom, though to me you just sounded smug. “Explain your feelings and how things seem to you.” You gave me this advice like it was the secret to a happy marriage, like you and Mama weren’t in the process of drafting a separation agreement. Now there you are, still living in that rinky-dink house, the guardian of a family history that I doubt anybody treasures, except maybe you. It breaks my heart a little, the thought that after everything we went through there, the house and its memories, its trove of knickknacks that never became heirlooms, might mean something to you. Maybe they don’t, though, and you just can’t be bothered to move, because it would inconvenience you. You certainly haven’t done anything to maintain the property. As Nessa and I approach the front door, the paving stones are cracked, the lawn’s grown shaggy, and the shingles are so curled that a decent storm could bring the roof down on you. The one time I commented on the state of the place, you joked about me eyeing my inheritance, and I said that wasn’t very funny of you. You open the door even before we reach the porch, and I don’t want to think that you’ve been standing there awhile, waiting to greet us, nothing better to do. Your bald head shines in the evening light, the wound on the crown exposed in order to heal. You’re following the doctor’s orders, leaving it uncovered, though it must embarrass you. I try to avoid staring, not just because it hurts to think of you undergoing an operation, but because you’ve told me a few times lately that a susceptibility to melanoma is something I might get from you. You’ve said it out of care, I know, but each time, I’ve heard you laying down a curse. It’s a relief that I’m not expected to ask about the wound or show concern for you. You’ve downplayed it, so I’ve downplayed it. You’ve just called it a growth, so I’ve done the same. Once Nessa and I are inside, Nessa hugs you, even though she barely knows you. “You’ve arrived before our guest of honor,” you say. “Let’s sit in the living room, and I’ll get something to drink for you.” You look surprised when Nessa hands you the box of caramels she insisted on bringing. She seemed so pleased with herself when she told me they were halal that I didn’t have the heart to say it doesn’t matter with you. You take them and thank her. You don’t mention your diabetes. You do say she can keep her shoes on inside the house, which was never once, in 18 years of my living here, an option you presented to me. In the living room, Nessa and I sit on the sofa across from you. You’ve changed something about the room, but I can’t put my finger on it. Your eyes flit nervously between us and the window, keeping an eye out, I guess, for Alice Munro. You’ve already forgotten about our drinks. “You want to dig into the caramels?” Nessa says, hinting to you how hospitality is supposed to work. You shake your head and say you’d rather save them for later. Could the idea of hosting a Nobel laureate be unsettling you? You seemed so happy when I asked you for the favor. I knew agreeing was a big deal for you, since you and Munro aren’t exactly chums, but the request didn’t appear to bother you. You looked pleased to do something for me, as happy as I was to do something for Nessa, easy with the idea of making the call and issuing the invitation, especially when I said it could just be drinks. You aren’t usually one to be nervous. I used to wish that your self-confidence was something I’d learn from you. You were so impatient with my lack of eye contact, my stuttering speech. You, who were always so sure of yourself, knowing everything and everyone, claiming to possess more local secrets than Bayfield’s three doctors combined, because they each served a mere third of the town, while you served all of it, and plenty of folks clammed up around their physicians, holding them in too high regard to be forthcoming, while you were just a guy from Iran with a charming smile and the good business sense to put on a sympathetic face when people started unburdening themselves. You had the sense, too, to keep things to yourself, letting details slip out only at dinner years later, once the person had died or moved out of town and, as far as you were concerned, released you of your obligation. You never told us anything about Alice Munro. Your anxiety must be obvious even to Nessa, because when she addresses you, she does so in a soothing way that I wouldn’t expect from her right now, not when her own nerves must be fraying. “You don’t know how much it means to me that you arranged this,” she says. “I hope it’s not an inconvenience to you.” “No, not at all,” you reply, “I’m very happy to do it for you.” “I didn’t realize,” says Nessa, “that Munro was a friend of yours.” You give a little smile. “You know, I wouldn’t quite say we’re friends. When someone does business with you for a few decades, though, they get to know you. You maybe feel a closeness to them.” “You feel close to Alice Munro?” I say. There’s an unintended harshness in my voice, and I cringe at how easily the old knee-jerk teen contempt returns, but it has never much fazed you. You seem to accept such moods as the price of having a son. “You think that’s a strange thing to say?” you ask, still smiling. “I suppose it’s not the closeness of friends—not like the two of you.” You look at me as if you have me all figured out, as if you know about the on-again-off-again mess of my life, not only with Nessa but in all things, and then you turn to her, apparently happy to leave me aside. You have more to say about your closeness to Munro, I can tell, but I don’t want to listen. “Sorry,” I say, rising, “but I get this uncontrollable need to use the little boys’ room whenever the talk turns to Alice Munro.” “It’s true,” says Nessa with a laugh, “tonight’s going to be hard on you.” You laugh, too, as if you find nothing more hilarious than the thought of my manic incontinence. Upstairs, your bedroom door is closed, which is unlike you. I don’t know what compels me to open it and walk in, but I do, and right away I’m hit by the scent of aftershave, work sweat, the smell of you. I keep on going, inspecting the room for traces of you. Your laundry hamper’s full, the bed’s unmade, and a thin film of dust covers the surfaces. Still sitting atop your dresser, after all these years, are the mortar and pestle I made from clay in grade three for you. You must be getting sloppy as you near retirement, because you spent years hectoring us not to waste electricity, and now the light in the en suite bathroom has been left on. As I go to turn it off, I glimpse myself in the mirror, and for a second, I can’t help it, I picture my head gone bald and my eyes pinched by crow’s-feet as pronounced as yours. You were 45 when I was born, and I hope I have a long time yet before I turn into you, but already I can see how it will work, like something you orchestrated a long time ago. Then I spot the second toothbrush in the cup, nestled next to yours. The anger that swells in me would frighten you. I tell myself to relax, to act like you. You wouldn’t like what I do next, though: I reach down to press my thumb against the bristles of each brush in turn, and I find they’re both wet. Not a usual one and a spare, then, but two people’s—his and yours. I go to the closet next, where, sure enough, I find clothes that don’t belong to you. You’ve let him, whoever he is, use Mama’s side. This time, then, it’s not just a fling with a cottager or a bachelor farmer who hit it off with you. It’s been almost six years since we left you here, and I guess the statutory waiting period has ended, so that the house can finally be given over to whoever’s with you. Downstairs, there’s still no sign of Alice Munro. “Has she come over here before?” Nessa asks you. You say she hasn’t, and then, for some reason, you admit to inviting her today only because I asked you. After this confession, I expect Nessa to say that I never should have made such a request, but instead she just frowns at you. “You think maybe we should call her?” she says. “You know, to make sure she’s all right?” You reply that you don’t have Munro’s number here at home. “You have it at the store, though?” Nessa says. “We could go in with you.” You seem to consider it but shake your head. “You might wonder how I’ve suddenly gained compunctions,” you say, “but I worry she’d think me too persistent—” “Oh, yes, of course,” says Nessa, “that’s very right of you.” “You know she’s not really coming,” I hear myself declare. You and Nessa turn to me with a shared look of bemusement. “You never actually invited her, did you?” I go on. “You just said you did so you could get us over here. You’re always complaining that I never come by.” You look at me like I’m crazy, and it’s true, I don’t have a shred of evidence to back me up, at least not beyond the indisputable absence of Alice Munro. “She could be sick,” says Nessa, sounding uneasy, “or she might have a flat tire, or she could have forgotten where you—” “You don’t have to make excuses for him,” I say. “You see what you’ve done, Baba? You think it’s funny, playing with Nessa’s feelings?” Your eyebrows arch. “What’s gotten into you?” My breathing comes fast, and it only gets worse when I consider the likelihood that at any second, the doorbell will ring, and standing on the porch with a modestly priced but thoughtfully chosen bottle of wine will be Alice Munro. “I think I’ll go outside to keep watch,” says Nessa, getting up and heading for the door, “and you two can talk among yourselves.” You stand, too, and start to apologize for me, but Nessa says it’s fine and leaves. My eyes travel over everything in the room but you. You’re starting to say something when I finally realize what’s different about the place: The framed photographs of our family that used to sit on the bookshelves and mantelpiece have disappeared. “You got rid of our photos?” I exclaim. Your expression turns sheepish, which makes it worse. I would have preferred a front, a lie, something to let me stay furious with you. “You shouldn’t take it the wrong way,” you tell me. “Every day, I think about Nabila and you.” “You don’t think about Mama, though,” I say, pouncing. “Your family doesn’t include her anymore.” You grimace, and I glance at my watch. “It’s after eight,” I say, “and no Alice Munro. If you want to stick with your story about inviting her, fine, but you don’t really think she’s coming, do you?” You shrug. “Why would I lie to you?” “Baba, I can’t read that mind of yours. You’re an enigma.” I wait in vain for a protest from you. “Anyhow, Nessa and I should go,” I say, “so your new boyfriend can come back to you.” My eyes meet yours. You don’t look surprised by what I’ve said, and I wonder whether you could hear me checking out your room. “You send him down the street or what?” I say. “Is he waiting for a call from you?” “You can stop this now,” you say. “I’m not hiding him from you. I just thought that tonight, with the fuss about Alice Munro—” “You figured you could cover things up like in the good old days.” You stiffen, and I know I shouldn’t have said it. Those times were hard on you. They weren’t fair to you. You must sometimes speculate, as I do, about how much better your life could have been, how much easier it would have been for you and Mama both, if you’d been born 20 years later, maybe even 10. “You’re right,” I say, “I’m sorry. It’s not my business; it’s yours.” If I were a different son and you a different father, this would be the moment when I’d hug you. I have this thought, and then a second later, I’m being wrapped up in those long arms of yours. You feel thinner than I remember, and at least for the time you hold me, you’re not the figure who inhabits half of my mental real estate; you’re just a fragile fellow human creature. You squeeze me, and I swear, I should be living better in this moment, trying to make sense of it, but all I find myself thinking is what would happen if the door were to open and we were to be found in this position by Alice Munro. Finally, I detach myself from you. “You think I should see if Nessa’s all right?” I say. You nod. “Tell her I feel bad about Alice Munro.” “I’ll tell her, Baba,” I reply, “but honestly, I don’t even know if she really wanted to meet Alice Munro. Don’t they say it’s better to keep your heroes at a distance from you?” You wave me toward the door. “You’re a good friend to her,” you say. “You really think she’ll be all right?” You look relieved when I say I do, and then you lapse into contemplation. “You’ll be all right too, habibi,” you say at last. I don’t know how to reply, so I just stare at you. You and Mama always seemed so miserable that for years, I made it a priority to seem fine in your vicinity. I don’t want to know that the fact of me not being fine is, after all this time, so visible to you. “You’ll be okay,” you repeat. “You’ll write about this.” You take in my reaction and grin, knowing you’re right. “You think writing about it will make me okay?” I ask. As I say it, I begin to realize the implication in that statement of yours. You, who were always so proud of my poems until they started being about our family, are granting me permission to write about you. Or maybe not granting it, exactly, so much as accepting that I can’t help writing about you, if not always wanting to be right there with you, sharing your space, then at least wanting to be one door over, next to you. The sun had set, and Nessa had mostly given up hope of meeting Alice Munro. Every time a car turned down the street, she still felt a shot of adrenaline, but each one continued on by, its windows changed to mirrors under the yellow streetlights, so that Nessa couldn’t even try to see whether any of the vehicles carried Alice Munro. It would be funny, in a way, if one of them did, and Munro had just written out the wrong address, or maybe she’d gotten cold feet at the last second and driven right past the house, feeling as anxious as Nessa did about the idea of an evening devoted to awkward conversation between one of the world’s great writers and, as Nessa would proudly admit to being on any other occasion, one of the all-time fangirls of Alice Munro. The truth was, though, that her mind was only half-committed to Alice Munro. Her thoughts kept returning to Hadi and his father, and maybe it wasn’t her beeswax, why Hadi had acted like that, or what the two of them were talking about now, but by coming here with him, she’d become part of it somehow, and if she couldn’t stop thinking about them, well, this could be what people meant when they said you dance with the one who brung ya. Given that Nessa had never corresponded with Munro, it was pretty much impossible that the woman could have her number, but still, when her phone vibrated as she stood there on the porch, her first reaction was to think it was Alice Munro. Turned out it was her mother, texting to ask how things were going, as if she had her eye on the clock, sitting there alone in her Toronto townhouse, carefully imagining, step by step, how the night might progress for her only child as she rubbed elbows with Alice Munro. Nessa never should have told her about the evening, but she’d been so excited that she’d texted the news without really thinking, and she’d done it with pleasure, delighted, not for the first time, that she had merely to press a single letter for her phone to autofill the words “Alice Munro.” Now, faced with her mother’s text, she decided not to reply, because if she confessed that Munro hadn’t turned up, there’d be a barrage of messages, maybe an offer by her mother to drive to Bayfield, and, quite possibly by the end of the night, an all-points bulletin out for Alice Munro. Nessa slipped her phone into her pocket and returned her eyes to the street, trying to see it as Munro would see it, but she found her mind wandering back to herself and Hadi rather than Alice Munro. They weren’t a couple, and Nessa always told people that this fact could be blamed on him, but in truth, he wasn’t the only standoffish one, and maybe their casual approach suited her as much as him, in the same way that maybe it suited her to be so obsessed with Alice Munro. If she said as much to Hadi, though, he’d ask why it suited her to be that way, and she didn’t have an answer, except to say that she probably needed therapy, but instead of getting it, she’d likely just go back to looking for answers where she’d been finding them most reliably until that point, which was in the stories of Alice Munro. Alice Munro wouldn’t take in the houses lining the far side of the street and see just houses. Alice Munro wouldn’t stand there and think only of herself. Alice Munro would look beyond the facades of the gimcrack Tudors and postwar bungalows, beyond the garden sprinklers and the dog walkers. She’d escape the straits of her own tiding ego, and somehow she’d find a way to link everything together, interfolding the objective and the subjective, irradiating the material with the ethereal, until people, places, and happenings that had once seemed separate were revealed as inextricably, inexhaustibly connected, so that joining her in figuring out how you were the same as someone else, how you differed, and how you affected each other could turn out to be a whole life for you. Nessa had this thought, and then the thought that she needed to stop measuring herself against Alice Munro. Behind her, the front door opened and Hadi came out to stand beside her, looking toward the street in the way you do when there’s no real hope in it for you. He asked if she’d seen any sign, and when she said she hadn’t, he seemed authentically bummed out, though she knew his disappointment had to be on her behalf, not because he held high expectations of Alice Munro. “Listen,” he said, leaning against the porch rail, “I’m sorry for accusing him like that, right in front of you. I don’t know why I said it, and I don’t know why she hasn’t turned up, but I hope it’s not too hard on you. I don’t know what to tell you. Maybe we should start asking emergency rooms if they’ve admitted any Alice Munros.” She smiled but didn’t say anything, because for the first time in as long as she could remember, she found herself not wanting to talk about Alice Munro. “You know, I think your father’s a pretty nice guy,” she said instead. “You’ve been a little hard on him, maybe, the way you talk about him with me.” “He’s okay,” said Hadi, “but keep in mind that he was putting on his best face for you.” “Was it for me,” she said, “or was it a warm-up for Alice Munro?” He laughed in the way you do when you know a friend’s trying to make you laugh and you want to oblige them, to reassure them that things will be all right for the two of you. “You have any idea what’s going on with that scab on his head?” Nessa asked. She’d been alarmed to see it, because Hadi hadn’t mentioned it before, and it looked serious, bad enough for her to wonder whether the man should be hosting drinks for anybody, never mind Alice Munro. “Sorry,” said Hadi, “I should have warned you. It’s nothing; he just had a growth removed, but that meant taking off a bunch of skin and what have you.” Nessa said she hoped he’d be okay, and that if she was being honest, the sight of it had been strangely comforting, giving her something to worry about other than Alice Munro. As soon as she said it, Hadi glanced at his watch, as if that had become a reflex whenever someone said “Alice Munro.” “You’ll be thrilled to hear she’s an hour late,” he said, “so it’s pretty safe to say she isn’t coming. You up for finding her house in Clinton and setting it on fire?” Nessa said that sounded fine, as long as they made sure the place had been vacated by Alice Munro. They were just bantering, but as she spoke, she realized that without her being aware, in the span of the past hour, something had turned for her, something she couldn’t put a finger on, but something that meant the next few years of her life had become a road gone dark, a derelict house with the shutters blown open, because suddenly she doubted her commitment to working on Alice Munro. All at once, her life seemed to have fallen away, like a booster rocket plummeting to Earth, and around her was the weightlessness of space, without sound or atmosphere, only a cold void that cares for no one and makes no acknowledgment of you. “You okay?” said Hadi, breaking her train of thought. “Yeah, sure,” she replied, “why wouldn’t I be fine, when I just had the honor of being stood up by Alice Munro?” She told him she was ready to leave, but she didn’t want to go without saying thank you. As they turned to head back inside, she considered telling him that she was thinking of writing her dissertation on somebody other than Alice Munro. And also, she’d say, I think it’s time we had a conversation about me and you. Besties are forever, and buddy-fucking is fine, but what are we doing here, what do you want from me, and what, all this time, have I been wanting from you? You never knew how such conversations would go, but she thought the two of them might be able to handle it, with the stress of waiting now over and the dark country roads to soothe them on the drive ahead. She’d just stepped into the house with Hadi behind her, and she was looking ahead to the kitchen where his father stood in a rectangle of light, taking glasses from the cupboard, when a voice called to them from the driveway and she froze, a tingle shooting down her back, though she knew the voice wasn’t Alice Munro’s. It was a man’s, and when she turned to look, it was, in fact, a man who stood there, gray-haired and lavishly love-handled with a sweet smile, the smile of a sensitive stranger who needs to ask something but is reluctant to bother you. “You must be Hadi,” he said, climbing the porch stairs and reaching out his hand. Hadi stood there as though unable to process the fact that this wasn’t Alice Munro. “Did my father text you?” When the man said he had, Hadi smiled and shook his hand, adding, “You really were just around the corner, weren’t you? You’d better come in.” “You’re Nessa?” the man asked, shaking her hand too. “The one who works on Alice Munro? I’ve heard a lot about both of you.” “You have?” said Hadi. “Because I haven’t heard so much about you.” “Well, maybe we can change that,” the man said, “although I worry I’m going to be a letdown after you were expecting Alice Munro.” As they went into the house together, Nessa held back from saying that she no longer worked on Alice Munro. Later, there’d be time for her to ask Hadi who this guy was, and what the hell she’d write her dissertation on now, so she just went with them into the kitchen, where Hadi’s father had already poured the drinks, and still she felt that someone was missing from the scene, that it was the kind of situation you’d understand better if it was described to you by Alice Munro. Nessa got out her phone and saw she’d received a dozen texts from her mother, the last one ending “Where are you?” Her mother, who always wrote texts as though they were letters, with capitalization and apostrophes, and who expected you, in turn, to spell out every word when you wrote “I love you.” “It’s all good,” Nessa texted her, “but there was no Alice Munro. Heading home soon, turning off the phone—telling you now so I don’t worry you.” She switched the phone off, and when she gave her attention back to her companions in the kitchen, she discovered that the man from the driveway was talking about his and Nazem’s attempts at jogging together on a Couch to 5K program, which promised nine weeks to a new you. Nessa wished that someone had told her his name, especially when he knew hers, which meant she couldn’t say, “My name’s Nessa, by the way, what’s yours?” You could probably spend your entire life trying to figure out a way of being good to both other people and yourself, adding a bit of loyalty here, a touch of betrayal there, never getting the balance right. At least for the next few minutes, she might try just listening and watching, hoping for an acuity of vision that she seldom felt she had, except when sitting alone with a story by Alice Munro. You slipped out of yourself, then, and got partway into the head of someone else. She thought she might try it in real life, listening to the man from the driveway talk, observing how Hadi nodded with his arms crossed, seeing how his father edged almost imperceptibly closer to the man from the driveway as he spoke—and for a time, it seemed to work; she felt herself both there and absent from the scene, but then the man from the driveway turned to her, and she realized that plans never panned out the way you hoped when they depended on others’ actions, not only yours. You never knew what people were going to say or do next. You never knew when they were going to call on you. “So,” the man from the driveway said, “why don’t you tell us about yourself?”"

        "year": "2021",
        "story": "During the interview, I realized almost immediately that the woman was pregnant—I guessed she was about halfway along—but she didn’t remark on it, and of course neither did I. Over the phone, we’d discussed only her 3-year-old daughter. The woman, whose name was Diane, was looking for a babysitter for the girl, whose name was Sophie, two mornings a week from 9 a.m. to noon, for $10 an hour. This was in late January 1997, my senior year at U-Dub—the University of Washington—and I’d seen the job advertised on an index card pinned to the bulletin board outside the career center, the information in tidy blue cursive. We met for the interview at a café near campus, after describing ourselves over the phone. She’d said, “I’m 5’4, and I have tortoiseshell glasses and light-brown hair cut in a bob.” Having never previously described my appearance to a stranger, I hesitated before saying, “I’m 5’9, and I have light-brown hair too, but curly. And no glasses.” When I entered the café, I looked around, and a woman with light-brown hair and glasses waved. When I reached the table where she sat, she smiled. “Kit?” I nodded, and she held her hand to her chest and, in a quiet voice, said, “Diane.” Still quietly, she thanked me for coming and asked if I’d like something to drink. “My treat,” she added, and it was when she reached for her wallet and passed me a $5 bill that I noticed the hard swell of her belly beneath a loose black sweater. I went to the counter and ordered a cappuccino, and back at the table, I dropped the dollar bill and change in front of Diane more gracelessly than I’d intended. Then I sat down again. She asked, then apologized for asking, whether I knew what I was doing after graduation (moving to Tucson with a friend, and, as soon as I was eligible for in-state tuition, applying to law school at the University of Arizona); whether I was from Seattle (no, but Olympia, so not too far); and whether I had brothers or sisters (when I said yes, seven of them, she seemed so startled that I added, as I did whenever people found this fact distractingly surprising, that they all were younger half siblings from my parents’ remarriages to other people). Only then did Diane inquire about my babysitting experience. After I described working informally for families in my mom’s neighborhood starting at the age of 13 and officially nannying the previous summer for twin infants and the summer before that for a 5-year-old and an 8-year-old, she said, “You sound more than qualified to watch Sophie. I’m trying to finish up my dissertation for a doctorate in art history. I did the coursework when we lived in New York, and now I just need to write the last two chapters. Sophie goes to preschool Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but you’d come the other mornings and, if this works with your schedule, the occasional Saturday night. Not every week, though. My husband usually works on the weekends.” Was the job mine? I hoped so. The job I already had, which was 15 hours a week in the office of a vice provost, mostly involved transcribing letters dictated by the vice provost on mini cassette tapes. I listened to the tapes via headphones connected to a machine made for this purpose, whose main body sat on a desk with a foot pump down below that I could tap to rewind the tape several seconds. To indicate formatting, the vice provost, whom I never spoke with directly, would say, “Period, paragraph,” and the words period, paragraph often accompanied me through the other parts of my life, as did the smell of the office, which was a combination of copy-machine ink, coffee, and the fake rose perfume of the secretary to whom I reported, who’d worked there for more than 30 years. The secretary was nice, and I hated transcribing, hated the office’s smell, and earned $5.80 an hour, after annual raises on the $4.75 I’d been making when I’d started as a freshman. Even if Diane hired me, I’d hold on to the administrative job—I needed to buy half a car by June—but the babysitting position seemed tantalizingly, almost suspiciously lucrative. Then Diane said, “Did you bring a résumé? I’d like to call your references as soon as possible.” “Oh, I don’t have that on me.” I chose not to mention that I didn’t have a résumé anywhere else, either. “But I can get phone numbers to you later today.” “Do you have a car?” Buying the car was the reason I’d started checking the career-center bulletin board. Together with my housemate Kevin, who was not exactly my friend and also unfortunately not my boyfriend, I was, for $2,000, going to purchase from a third housemate a navy-blue Ford Taurus with 80,000 miles on it. Kevin and I would drive it to Tucson, where he was from, and share it once we got there, which seemed to me to be thrillingly like something a married couple would do, as if we were simply vaulting over the dating phase. To Diane, I said, “I have a bike.” Diane’s brow furrowed briefly, but then she said, “I think that should be fine. We live close to campus, in Ravenna. Would you be free to come over tomorrow morning to meet Sophie, so we can see if it’s a good fit? It could just be for half an hour, but I’ll pay you for two hours.” A good fit? I thought. For a 3-year-old? Several times I’d been left to look after kids whose families I’d never met until a few minutes prior. At the same time, it seemed obscene—in a good way—to receive $20 for a half hour of work. “Sure,” I said. “I can do that.” I’d wondered if their house would be huge, but it wasn’t. It was pretty, though, the wooden exterior painted pale green, with a pitched roof and a front porch. Though it was overcast and only 45 degrees out, Diane and Sophie were waiting on the porch when I arrived. As I climbed off my bike and walked it up the brick path to the porch steps, Sophie called to me, “Becca has two guinea pigs.” “Wow,” I said. “Lucky Becca.” Making eye contact above her daughter’s head, Diane said to me, “Sophie’s friend from school. Sophie, this is Kit. Can you say hello?” “They eat carrots,” Sophie said. “You know what?” I was, by this point, squatting in front of her. “I eat carrots. But I’m pretty sure I’m not a guinea pig.” Sophie grinned. “If you have one, you have to have another so they don’t get lonely.” “Hmm,” I said. “Carrots or guinea pigs?” Sophie then shrieked—apparently with happiness—and I hoped again that I’d be hired. Inside, they gave me a tour. The rooms were all tidy, and the furniture was simple but somehow expensive-looking: a rectangular sofa with a gray linen slipcover, a coffee table of light wood that matched the wood of the bookshelves. At the rear of the house, off the kitchen, was a sun porch they’d made into a playroom, where picture books lined a small shelf, and toys were stored in canvas bins. Upstairs, of the four bedrooms, one was Diane’s office and one was a guest room with a double bed; none was a nursery. When Sophie and I returned to the playroom, Diane stayed on the second floor. Sophie turned out to be obsessed with the movie The Little Mermaid, and she wanted to act as Princess Ariel while I was Scuttle the seagull. Approximately 50 times in a row, we re-created the moment when Ariel brings Scuttle objects from a shipwreck. “Scuttle,” Sophie-as-Ariel said, “look what we found!” “Oh, look at this,” I replied as Scuttle, holding aloft the dinner fork she’d passed me, which had a yellow resin handle. “Wow. This is special. This is very, very unusual.” Sophie had taught me my lines, and when I used only one very, she always flagged the omission. “What?” Sophie-as-Ariel asked. “What is it?” “It’s a … dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies to straighten their hair out.” Then I’d use the fork to brush my hair. Each time we got to the dinglehopper part, Sophie laughed boisterously, then leaned her face in very close to mine and, as herself, whispered, “It’s a fork.” Then she’d take the utensil from my hand and say once again, in her Ariel voice, “Scuttle, look what we found!” We were still doing this—it was all we’d done—when Diane reappeared after about 20 minutes and said, “It sounds like you two have had a lot of fun. Sophie, would you like it if Kit comes back to play for longer?” It had occurred to me that she was listening from the second floor, and although I didn’t think of myself as a person who did well under pressure, I was optimistic. Sophie scowled at her mother, the first sign of petulance I’d seen in her. “That’s not Kit,” Sophie hissed. “That’s Scuttle.” I knew I was in. It was true enough that I planned to apply to law school, although going to law school was not the main reason I was moving to Arizona. I was moving to Arizona because one night in December, Kevin had said, “You should move to Tucson with me.” “Really?” I’d said. “Yeah,” he’d said. “We can be roommates.” When he said this, we were lying fully clothed above the covers on the futon that was my bed, him on his back, me on my side, with about two feet of space between us. We’d just finished watching an episode of The X-Files—I owned VHS box sets of all the available seasons—and the credits were rolling, accompanied by that spooky music. Kevin and I had never kissed, and we’d known each other only since moving into the same run-down six-person house in August. For the first month, we hardly interacted; our rooms were at opposite ends of a long hall. If my friend Cath, who’d told me about the opening in the house, was around, she and I usually made spaghetti for dinner and ate it in the kitchen, but otherwise, I ate meals in my room. If I was hungry, I bought a burrito for dinner, and if I wasn’t that hungry, I ate a bowl of Corn Pops, which was also what I ate every day for breakfast. While I ate, I read copies of the UW Daily and The Seattle Times that I’d taken from the recycling bin in the vice provost’s office. Once, in early October, just after 2 in the morning, I’d been watching The X-Files, and someone knocked on my slightly open door, and then Kevin asked, “Is that the one where Mulder finds out why his sister was taken?” We proceeded to spend half an hour discussing which episodes we liked best, by which point my face was burning because of how much I enjoyed talking to him. I then gathered my courage and said, “We could watch another one now?” “Yeah, for sure,” he said, then clambered knees-first onto the futon, lay on his back, and settled his head against one of my two pillows. At his approach, I’d instinctively scooted a few inches away, which I regretted within seconds. But scooting in again felt too obvious. So I stayed where I was but turned on my side, curling my body toward his as I fast-forwarded to the next episode. I proceeded to absorb none of it, which didn’t really matter, because I’d already watched it several times. This pattern—the physical configuration, the viewing of the program—repeated itself several times a week from that night on. It often occurred to me that the way our bodies angled complementarily in each other’s direction without touching at any point was similar to the Earth’s continents. If pushed together, I thought, our contours would fit perfectly, as if, like the ancient supercontinent Pangaea, we’d previously been attached. In those first couple of weeks, I frequently wondered if Kevin was about to become my boyfriend, until the time he brought home another girl, and I passed both of them in the hall as I returned to my room after brushing my teeth. “Hey, Kit!” Kevin said in a friendly voice, and the girl, whom I’d never before laid eyes on, said in the exact same tone, “Hey, Kit!” I went into my room, closed the door, and cried so hard that I had to change my pillowcase. Back then, I believed that incidents or moments or words people said were proof of one thing or proof of another; I believed in proof over ambiguity, even when the proof supported a disappointing outcome. When Kevin hooked up with that girl, it was proof that he didn’t want to be my boyfriend, but then, when he suggested that I move to Tucson with him—he was moving back to work for his father’s property-management company—it was proof that the secret love between us was mutual. He added, “Theresa is going to sell me her car for 2,000 bucks, but we could split the cost and both use it. And we wouldn’t have to pay rent, because we’d live in one of my dad’s units. Are you thinking of becoming a lawyer? The U of A law school is really good.” The logistics of life after college baffled me. How did a person know what to do with herself? I didn’t want to return to Olympia, because my parents’ houses were crowded and, inside them, someone was almost always sick or crying, or two people were squabbling. “Well, I wasn’t thinking of becoming a lawyer,” I said. “But it’s a good idea.” In the third week of my babysitting job, it rained as I biked over, and, because my clothes got soaked, Diane lent me a T-shirt, a hooded sweatshirt, and sweatpants. The sweatshirt was gray, with maroon letters spelling out Harvard, and when I emerged from the bathroom after changing, I asked, “Did you go to Harvard?” I had never, to my knowledge, met someone who had. “Yes, but that’s actually Bryan’s sweatshirt.” “Did he go to Harvard too?” “He was the year ahead of me. I wanted to ask: Would you be free to babysit this Saturday? I know it’s late notice.” In general, Diane was both more formal and more considerate than anyone else I’d babysat for. She’d ask, rather than instruct—would I like to take Sophie to the library today? Would it work to bake cookies with Sophie?—and when I’d pulled up in front of their house on my bike that morning, she and Sophie had been waiting outside in raincoats. “I feel terrible,” Diane said. “I tried calling you, but I think you’d already left. When it next rains like this, we can pick you up.” She also told me to help myself to whatever food I wanted when it was Sophie’s snack time. Almost all their food, I’d discovered, was organic. “I can babysit on Saturday,” I said. Instead of my biking on Saturday evening, Diane picked me up. When we walked together into the kitchen through the garage, Sophie sat with a plate of macaroni and cheese, cut-up chicken, and steamed broccoli in front of her; across the table sat a short man with receding brown hair and round-lensed wire glasses. “I don’t think you’ve met Bryan, have you?” Diane said to me. “The famous Kit!” Bryan exclaimed, and his voice was warm. “My Little Mermaid rival!” I must have looked uncertain, because he added, “I used to play the role of Scuttle, but apparently I’m not nearly as good as you.” He grabbed Sophie’s fork off the table, inspected it, and said, “It’s a … dinglehopper.” Then he laughed uproariously. I glanced at Sophie and then Diane, who was at the sink squeezing dish soap into a pot, and neither of them seemed surprised by Bryan’s ebullience. “Seriously,” Bryan said, “thanks for all your help. I’ve heard nothing but raves.” “Oh,” I said. “Sure.” From the sink, Diane said, “Sophie goes to bed at 7:30, so if you head upstairs at 7, there should be plenty of time for bath and two or three books. The restaurant we’re going to is called Buongusto, and I left the number on the message pad by the phone. The reservation is under our last name.” “We’re going to have such a crazy Saturday night that we might even stay out until 10 p.m.,” Bryan said. He again laughed that laugh that seemed to dramatically exceed its cause yet came off as endearing rather than annoying. He possessed some palpable intelligence and confidence that made his friendliness feel optional, as if he was a good guy by choice rather than by requirement. Or maybe I just thought that because I knew he’d gone to Harvard. “Kit, I drawed a tornado,” Sophie said as I took a seat next to her at the table. “Awesome,” I said. “I drew,” Bryan said. “The lotion for after the bath is on top of Sophie’s dresser,” Diane said. “Tornadoes form because warm and cold air mix together,” Sophie said. “Although luckily, they almost never happen around here,” I said. “After you finish eating, I’d love for you to show me your picture.” I pointed to her plate. “Your dinner looks delicious.” “I’ll let you take over this uphill battle.” Bryan stood. “Diane, you ready?” They both embraced Sophie, and after they were gone, she and I did our usual activities—she had a family of clothed cotton-mice figurines we often played with, then we drew pictures, then we acted out the dinglehopper scene a dozen times—plus the bath, during which she pointed between her legs and said, “It’s not called a bagina. It’s called a vagina.” “Yes,” I said. “That’s true.” After I’d read her a few books and tucked her in, I sat for a while at her request on the floor in the upstairs hallway outside her room. When I was sure that she was asleep, I went to the kitchen, fixed myself a bowl of organic vanilla ice cream with organic hot-fudge sauce, ate it, cleaned up those dishes and the ones from dinner, and sat in the living room reading the magazines on a side table: Time, then Scientific American, then Harvard Magazine. Although I knew that Diane and Bryan’s last name was Woley, I wasn’t sure how old they were. I guessed 31 and 32, but when I looked at the alumni notes for people who’d graduated in 1987 or 1988, and then in the years before and after, there was no mention of either of them. There were, however, many sentences so strange and specific that I had to reread them multiple times before even partially decoding them: “Anders McFadden writes in from Boston, ‘In March, my wife Izzie and I had the pleasure of catching up in Gstaad with Pete and Katherine “Weewee” Horstman. Fabulous skiing and plentiful libations!’” The Woleys returned at 10 on the dot, and Bryan gave me a ride home. He drove a Jeep Grand Cherokee—it was much bigger than Diane’s Volvo sedan—and as I buckled my seat belt, he asked, “You’re a senior, right? What’s your major?” “Sociology.” “Meaning Engels and Durkheim and those guys?” “Well, they’re the foundation, but I take classes more on modern stuff like the legal system and health care.” “What about the legal system and health care?” I hesitated—being asked about myself was almost disorienting, and by an adult male even more so—before saying, “My last paper was about how we define health, like ‘we’ meaning ‘society.’” “So why is a sociology major going to law school?” His tone remained warm, and I noted with some surprise that Diane must have told him of my plans. “Do you really want to be a lawyer, or are you one of those people who goes to law school because they have no idea what else to do with their life?” He then exploded with laughter, then quieted down, but when I said, “Both,” he exploded with laughter anew. When he’d settled again, he said, “Graduating from college is incredibly confusing. It’s amazing to have so many options, and it’s terrifying to have so many options. I double-majored in computer science and electrical engineering, and I use both and neither every day. The former I use more practically, but the latter underpins a lot of the way I see the world.” “What’s your job?” “I started an internet sales company,” he said. “Oh,” I said. “Cool.” “Do you ever look at the web?” “I have before.” “What kind of things do you look up?” “Well, I only looked once, but do you know who Jewel is? The singer? There’s a song of hers, and I wanted to know the words, but I couldn’t find them.” “Yeah, totally.” Bryan was nodding. “A start-up is a lot of long hours now, which isn’t ideal, with this stage in our family’s life, but you’ve got to strike while the iron’s hot.” Surely this was an allusion to Diane’s pregnancy, but he didn’t elaborate. My theory was that perhaps Diane had had troubled pregnancies in the past and was superstitious. “Here’s a dilemma for you,” Bryan said. “Has Sophie ever told you she really wants a Barbie?” “Yes.” “Diane’s adamant that we shouldn’t get her one, for the reasons you’d imagine—the sexism and whatnot. But my take is, don’t elevate Barbies by forbidding them. Just give her the damn doll and let her see it’s not that great.” I had, in my youth, owned Hawaiian Barbie, Astronaut Barbie, and Loving You Barbie (her dress had puffy sleeves and a pattern of hearts). I said, “Well, Sophie is definitely the smartest kid I’ve babysat for. She told me that we couldn’t have a Triceratops play with a Plateosaurus because one of them lived during the Cretaceous period and the other lived during the Triassic, but I don’t even remember which was which. I think she’ll be okay either way, though—if you do get her a Barbie or if you don’t.” “Kit, maybe you should be a lawyer,” Bryan said. “Because that was an impressively evasive answer.” As we turned right onto 20th Avenue, he explosively laughed before saying, “You know what it is?” I glanced across the front seat in confusion. “What what is?” He said, “It’s a … dinglehopper!” The next Tuesday, when Diane appeared on the first floor in the way that meant it was almost time for me to leave, she said, “I have a question, and you can think about it and answer on Thursday. You’ve probably noticed that I’m—” She swept her hand in front of her torso, as if saying the actual word was embarrassing. “I’m due April 22. We don’t have family here, and I’m wondering if you’re willing to be on call for when I go into labor, to come watch Sophie. Obviously, it could be in the middle of the night, but you wouldn’t have to bike—Bryan would come get you. My labor wasn’t crazily long the first time, so I don’t think you’d need to be here more than 24 hours, and I’d pay you a flat fee of $500 for the first 24 hours and $25 an hour after.” “Yeah, I’ll do that,” I said. “You really can think about it. It could mean missing class, depending on the timing.” I’d also potentially need to call in sick to my job in the vice provost’s office, but I was pretty sure I’d never mentioned that job to Diane. And besides: $500 for 24 hours? For a large chunk of which Sophie would be asleep, for all of which I’d have unfettered access to organic popcorn and pistachios and cheddar cheese? “No, I’ll do it,” I said. “It’s fine.” So Diane was further along than I’d thought, less than two months from her due date. I was relieved for her pregnancy to finally be acknowledged, and, in a different way, relieved at this request that made the job make sense. I even wondered if all my babysitting up to that point, including the previous Saturday night, had been an audition for the role of Sophie’s caretaker during the delivery—if it had been necessary for me to go from being a stranger to being trusted via the steps of babysitting Sophie with Diane in the house, meeting Bryan, babysitting solo. As far as I could tell, Diane really was working on her dissertation (sometimes Sophie and I passed her office, where she sat with her back to the open door, a laptop computer on the desk in front of her), but I knew well that concrete tasks and ulterior motives weren’t mutually exclusive. In fact, it was probably because I was a person regularly unable to say what I thought or meant or wanted that I perceived Diane as circumspect. Much later, after I myself became a mother, I perceived her less as incapable of expressing her wishes and more as both very careful and very private. I also wondered about her prescience—whether she’d cultivated care and privacy early, anticipating the eventual need for them. One Thursday in mid-April, just before I left the Woleys’ house, Diane handed me a business envelope and said, “I’m going to pay you now for when I have the baby. It’s cash. Is that okay?” Did she mean that $500 was inside the envelope? If so, it was by far the most money I’d ever had in my possession. “You can pay me after the baby comes,” I said. Diane’s expression was strange—it took me a few seconds to realize that it was probably an expression of self-consciousness—as she said, “Bryan and I don’t see eye to eye on how much a babysitter should be paid. I try to pay on the higher side, because what’s more important than the well-being of our child? When Sophie was 2, I once came back from the grocery store and her babysitter had gone to the bathroom and given her a plastic bag to play with to keep her busy, and I just thought, The fact that I even need to explain why this is unacceptable …” Diane trailed off. “If it comes up with Bryan, you can tell him I already paid you without specifying the amount. He’s a great person, a great dad, but he’s frugal.” I hadn’t previously known if she realized that she was overpaying me in general and vastly overpaying me for the delivery. In the moment, however, I was most struck by her trust—by how flattering her confidence was that I wouldn’t just take the cash and disappear. The $500 would push me over the thousand I needed to buy half the Ford Taurus. The very next day, a few minutes after 11 p.m., a housemate named Jessica knocked on the door of my room to tell me that I had a phone call. When I walked to the kitchen and lifted the receiver, a female voice said, “Kit, it’s Diane. Am I waking you up?” “No, I was watching TV.” “I’m—well, I’m in labor, actually. Can Bryan come get you?” She sounded no different, no less calm, than she usually did, and I thought of the times I’d observed my own mother on the cusp of having a baby. Once, at 4 in the morning, when I was 8 and my mother was about to have my sister Sherry, I’d awakened to her yelling up the staircase to my stepfather, “Fucking hell, Doug, my pink hairbrush, not my comb.” When I climbed into Bryan’s Jeep, he said, “It begins again,” then burst into laughter. While we rode back to their house, he was warm and chatty, thrumming with even more energy than usual, and as we pulled into the garage, he said, “Diane’s channeling her nerves into making sure she’s written down every last thing for you about how Sophie will want her morning oatmeal with 12 blueberries instead of 13, so our objective here is to reassure her that it’s all going to be fine.” “Sure,” I said. Inside, we walked up to the second floor and into Bryan and Diane’s bedroom, where Diane was zipping a small duffel bag set on an ottoman in front of a matching beige armchair. “Thanks for coming, Kit,” she said. There might have been something embarrassingly intimate about being in their room with both of them, with Sophie asleep in her bed, except that the significance of the impending baby overrode everything else. Diane said to me, “Would you mind setting the alarm clock in the guest room for 6 o’clock and then coming in and sitting there?” She gestured toward the armchair. “Sophie wakes up around 6:30, and she’ll run into our room and be confused if no one’s here. You can give her oatmeal for breakfast, and for lunch, a PB&J and fruit, and if you’re still here for dinner, there’s cash in an envelope on the kitchen table to order pizza. She likes just plain ch—oh God.” Abruptly, Diane turned, pressing her forearms against the wall and her head against her forearms. Bryan approached and rubbed her lower back. “You’re doing great, sweetie.” “Oh my God,” Diane whispered. (Fucking hell, Doug, my pink hairbrush, not my comb.) Again, I felt like either I was seeing something I shouldn’t or I was so unimportant that it didn’t matter. Bryan and I made eye contact. “We’re leaving now,” he said. “We’ll go out the back door, so come down in a few minutes and lock it again.” Just before 10 a.m., hours earlier than I’d expected, Bryan called the house to say that Diane had given birth to a healthy, seven-pound girl whose name was Emily Jane. He was going to come home, pick up Sophie and me, drop me off, and take Sophie to meet her sister. Sophie drew a picture of Ariel and Scuttle, above which I wrote the words Welcome Baby Emily. Presumably, Bryan had barely slept, but he was in high spirits, picking up Sophie and spinning her around the kitchen. “You’re going to be the best big sister,” he said. As we pulled out of the driveway, with me in the passenger seat and Sophie in the back, he said, “I know it’s a cliché, but the miracle of life is pretty damn miraculous. This actual human being exists where once there was no one. And she’s perfect!” “I like the name,” I said. “Then there’s the mind-bending question of what changes she’ll see in her lifetime,” Bryan said. “It’s totally conceivable that she’ll live to the age of 150 or 200 and travel to other planets, not as an astronaut but as a regular person.” “My great-grandma was born in 1895, and she’s still alive,” I said. “Sometimes I can’t believe she experienced the 1800s, even if it wasn’t for that long.” “Yeah, exactly,” Bryan said. “Think of everything she’s witnessed. At the turn of the century, cars and light bulbs barely existed, and now people have their own computers.” He glanced across the front seat. “Are you still planning to move to the desert for law school? If you decide to stick around here, I’ll be making a bunch of hires in the next six months.” “Well, I don’t really know anything about the World Wide Web.” An internet sales company sounded even more boring than the vice provost’s office (period, paragraph), but, so as not to seem ungrateful, I added, “Thank you, though.” “Have you ever heard the expression ‘Hire for talent, train for skills’?” “Now I have.” Though I hadn’t been joking, when he laughed his uproarious laugh, it sounded slightly different than it always had before, as if, perhaps unprecedentedly in our interactions, it was sincere rather than generously fake. “Besides,” he added, “in a company like mine, there are plenty of positions beyond programming—there’s customer service, writing copy for the website, etc., etc. Are you a good writer?” “Not really.” He laughed intensely. “At least you’re honest. But seriously, you’re a solid, reliable person, and, believe it or not, that’s rare. There are a lot of flakes out there.” From the back seat, Sophie said, “Daddy, what’s a flake?” “In this instance, I mean someone who says they’ll do something and doesn’t do it. But it can also mean a little piece of something, like cereal.” I turned around and said to Sophie, “I’m glad that I’m not a little piece of cereal! Are you looking forward to seeing baby Emily’s toes?” Sophie held up both hands and rubbed her fingertips together, as we’d practiced; in my experience, the feet were a good place for toddlers to touch a new sibling without manhandling them. In an earnest voice, Sophie said, “So tiny and so precious.” This time, when Bryan laughed, so did I. Babysitting for the Woleys didn’t change that much after Emily’s arrival; Diane usually kept the baby in the upstairs bedroom, or occasionally ran errands with her, so it was mostly still Sophie and me hanging out, walking to the park or the library. Emily cried sometimes, of course, but she was good-natured, and Diane still seemed calm and self-contained. The main differences were that there were purple circles under Diane’s eyes and more takeout containers of food in the refrigerator. And her parents came from Delaware to visit for a long weekend, but, though I heard about the visit from Sophie, I never met them. One early morning around this time, Kevin and I watched the episode of The X-Files in which, while on a case in rural Alaska, Mulder and Scully needed to examine each other’s bodies for a possible extraterrestrial-worm infection. As Kevin and I lay in our Pangaea posture—complementary, untouching—he said, “Would you rather fuck Mulder or Scully?” Immediately, my face was aflame. I didn’t look at Kevin as I said, “Mulder.” That this was the correct answer seemed obvious—Mulder was male, and Scully was female—but then Kevin said, “If both of them wanted to fuck you at the same time, would you do it?” I snuck a peek at him, but he was looking ahead at the TV. “I don’t think that’s going to happen,” I said. Kevin didn’t respond. I sensed that we were on a fulcrum, feared messing up, and suspected that not really answering would be the worst mistake of all. I blurted out, “I don’t get why threesomes are supposed to be that great, because I think the thing about sex that would be fun would be feeling really close to another person.” Immediately, I wanted to retract the words; I was humiliated by my use of conditional verbs, not to mention my sheer corniness. “But if the other people in the threesome are both hot,” Kevin said, “then wouldn’t that be fun too?” It did not occur to me until hours later, as I lay awake ruminating, that I could have asked him the same questions he was asking me. A week and a half before my graduation in mid-June, in a copy of The Seattle Times that I took from the vice provost’s office, I was surprised to see a tiny photo of Bryan Woley on the front page. The article, which had the headline “Pangaea to Go Public,” started, “Online bookstore and internet sales upstart Pangaea will publicly offer shares of its stock as soon as August, according to founder Bryan T. Woley …” Discovering that Bryan’s company was called Pangaea was even more astonishing than reading about him in the newspaper; the name felt like a good omen for moving to Tucson with Kevin, an affirmation from the universe. The next day, as Diane was letting me in the front door and Sophie cheerfully lay on the living-room floor with her legs in the air, I mentioned that I had seen the article. “Tell Bryan I say congratulations,” I said. Emily was still so little that Diane held her entirely with her right forearm, Emily’s head in the crook of Diane’s elbow. Diane smiled as she said, “Bryan told me he tried to recruit you, and I had to remind him that the Wild West of the internet isn’t everyone’s dream job. Believe it or not, when we first got out here, I was working full-time for the company too. But you know how people say ‘Packing a suitcase takes as much time as you leave for it’? Working for a start-up is like that. You’re never really finished, even if you’re putting in 18-hour days.” “A company like that seems really different from getting your Ph.D. in art history,” I said. At this, Diane smiled again. “Tell me about it,” she said. My father drove up from Olympia for my graduation, and, separately, so did my mother and my 12-year-old brother, Sean. We all skipped the massive ceremony in the stadium but attended the one for sociology majors, after which my mother took pictures of Sean and me before they left—my brother had a baseball game—and my father and I went out for 4 p.m. chicken fajitas. My father, who was generally unemotional, did not ask about my move to Arizona the following week but did say, as he paid the check, “Be careful of trucks on the highway. Some of the 18-wheelers don’t signal when they’re changing lanes.” Before he headed back to Olympia, he dropped me off in front of the group house and handed me an envelope that I opened, after he’d driven away, to find five crisp $20 bills. Inside, I ran into Kevin, his father, and his sister waiting for his mother to come out of the bathroom so they could get dinner at a seafood place. As soon as his father learned who I was, he invited me to join them, and, having nothing better to do, I accepted. When his mother emerged—she was a blonde who wore pale-pink lipstick and a sleeveless black shirt that revealed freckled, fleshy arms—Kevin introduced us. His mother squinted at me. “You’re Kit?” On my last day of babysitting, as Sophie and I drew with chalk on the sidewalk in front of the house, she whispered, “We’re having a tea party for you, but don’t tell, because it’s a surprise.” She held her index finger to her lips. Half an hour before I was to leave, Diane, carrying Emily, summoned Sophie and me to the kitchen, where we drank lemonade and ate quartered peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, sliced strawberries, and chocolate-chip cookies. They gave me a present wrapped in tissue paper, which turned out to be a copy of Dr. Seuss’s Oh, the Places You’ll Go!, along with a sealed envelope that I didn’t open. Then they walked me out to the front porch and hugged me—Emily still in Diane’s arm as Diane leaned forward, Sophie repeatedly squeezing my waist with both her arms. I had already told Sophie that I’d send her a picture of fossilized dinosaur footprints from Arizona. As I climbed onto my bike, I was almost sure that Diane was blinking back tears, which made me tear up too. “Bye, guys,” I called as I rode away. “Thank you so much for everything.” That I never said goodbye to Bryan was unsurprising, given that he wasn’t home during the day. The lesson I thought I’d gleaned from the Woleys—because I was still then a person who believed that situations provided lessons, rather than just marking the passage of time—was that two smart, dorky adults could join together and make a family, a sweet life. With other families I’d babysat for, the messiness of their lives was recognizable to me from my own upbringing, and always vaguely off-putting. Then there was the way couples fell in love in movies, beautiful women and handsome men who made witty comments and kissed passionately. The Woleys were neither disorderly nor overtly sexy. They offered a framework for an aspirational but perhaps attainable way of existing, a home of calm and kindness and seclusion. In the envelope from Diane were 10 crisp $20 bills, which is to say twice the amount that my father had given me. In Tucson, the apartment that Kevin and I shared had two bedrooms, and we spent most of our first full day moving furniture that had belonged to his deceased grandmother from a storage unit into the apartment’s empty rooms: an olive-green couch and a recliner, a wooden kitchen table and chairs. A high-school friend of Kevin’s named Miguel helped us, and that evening, while the three of us sat at the kitchen table eating pizza, Kevin informed me that there had been a misunderstanding and his parents wanted me to pay rent after all; they wanted $375 a month, which, he pointed out, was below market value for an apartment this size. I didn’t know if the disclosure in front of a third party was a strategy on Kevin’s part or just callousness. The previous night, his parents had been grilling by their pool with friends when we arrived in town, and his mother had introduced me by saying, “And this is Kevin’s little girlfriend.” Though the term ought to have offered proof, tonally it had done the opposite, confusing me. Kevin immediately began working for his dad, and I spent the days reading the Help Wanted section of the newspaper or else taking the bus to various malls and collecting job applications from stores and restaurants. On our first Saturday morning in the apartment, Kevin didn’t change out of the T-shirt and boxer shorts he’d apparently slept in, not as he ate a bagel and butter, nor before playing video games in the living room for several hours. Though glimpses of him in the hall in Seattle in similar clothing had been titillating, there was an insulting absence of vanity in this prolonged version of his self-presentation, as if I might as well have been watching him floss or pee. On my 10th day in Tucson, I got a job as a cashier at an overpriced grocery store that sold the kind of food the Woleys had purchased. To celebrate, I bought a six-pack of beer, and when I returned to the apartment, carrying it in a plastic bag, I opened the door to find Kevin’s friend Miguel standing by Kevin’s grandmother’s couch wearing only socks, with Kevin on his knees in front of Miguel, Kevin’s mouth wrapped around the head of Miguel’s penis. Here, at last, was my proof. I thought then that it was proof of my own idiocy, of the fakeness of our Pangaea, and of Kevin’s manipulative behavior, though with hindsight, the decisions we both made seem instead to be proof only of a kind of confusion common in one’s early 20s. It had already become clear that sharing a car was a logistical impossibility, and when, two weeks later, I moved into an apartment that I’d seen a listing for in the back of Tucson Weekly, I accepted $900 from Kevin for my half of the Ford Taurus and rode my bike to work. I stopped eating Corn Pops for dinner, learned to sauté vegetables, and didn’t apply to law school. One day, while making small talk with a middle-aged customer, I learned that she was a speech pathologist for kids at various public schools around the city, and as she described her job, I felt a jolt of jealousy and also a foreknowledge that was unusual in my life. Within three months, I’d applied for a master’s degree in speech-language pathology and audiology at the University of Arizona, and after working in the field for five years, I went back for my Ph.D. By the time I got a job as a professor at a not particularly well-known college in northern Illinois, it was 2008 and I was 33. This is the job I still have, though I’m tenured. I met my husband through a dating website, and the first time we had drinks, I drove 40 minutes to a bar and grill in Rockford. Now I live in Rockford and drive 40 minutes to teach. My years in Arizona were also, of course, the years during which Bryan Woley became kind of famous, then famous, then extremely famous. Without trying, I would routinely come across articles about him or see him on TV. Early on, he was considered either a curiosity for his exuberant confidence that we’d all eventually do most of our shopping online or else a harbinger of the death of mom-and-pop stores. In TV clips, he was the same as he’d been in their kitchen or the car, but on-screen, his animation and energy seemed unremarkable. I had never met another famous person and if Bryan’s name came up in conversation, mentioning that I knew him felt like an obligation, almost a compulsion. Then, in the spring of my first year in the master’s program, I was getting a beer from the refrigerator at a party, and through the swinging door that led to the dining room, I heard a graduate-school classmate say, in what apparently was an imitation of my voice, “Oh, yeah, I know them super-well. When I was their nanny, he gave me rides all the time. When they had their second baby, I slept in their bed.” While I froze in horror in the kitchen, the woman laughed, though at least it didn’t seem like she got much of a response from her listeners. It had never occurred to me that mentioning the Woleys was name-dropping; in my capacity as a fairly dull person, I thought I’d been sharing one of my few genuinely interesting tidbits. Also, I rarely lied or even exaggerated, so I wouldn’t have claimed to have slept in their bed. But overhearing my classmate got me to stop telling people that I knew the Woleys—and anyway, as the years passed, did I know them? Had my knowing them expired because of time and Bryan’s ascent? I had indeed sent a postcard of fossilized dinosaur footprints to Sophie, and both she and Diane wrote back—Sophie’s note was two sentences of huge, intermittently backwards letters about how she no longer needed her mother’s help brushing her teeth—then I got a Christmas card from Diane that first year, a photo of Sophie and Emily in their yard. Then we lost touch. Sometimes back then, when I saw Bryan on the cover of a magazine, I was tempted to email Diane and not mention having seen Bryan on the cover of a magazine, to demonstrate that I wasn’t obsessed with status, that I certainly didn’t hope to squeeze more money out of them, but why would I have been reaching out? The public view of Bryan went through a few iterations—he was kooky, he was predatory, he was prophetic, he was vindicated, he was villainous, he was respected—before, in 2017, he became the richest man in the world. By the time this happened, it had been years since I’d told anyone that I’d known the Woleys. The last person I ever told was my husband, and not until we’d been dating for months. If the news that Bryan and Diane were getting a divorce had broken, say, five years after I’d worked for them, I’m sure that I would have been devastated; I’d have thought that it undermined, or retroactively sullied, the sweetness of their family. But when I saw the headline on a news app on my phone one night, it had been more than 20 years since I’d been their babysitter. By 2018, Sophie was apparently a graduate of Harvard with a job at a museum in New York. (This? Why … oh, it’s a dinglehopper.) There were very few pictures online of Sophie or Emily, which surely was not an accident, but both Bryan and Diane looked better than they had in the late ’90s. Bryan was now shaved bald and visibly muscular and, like Diane, never wore glasses in public; Diane remained girlishly slim, with longer, stylishly cut hair. She didn’t look fake or like she’d had weird procedures done to her lips or skin; she just looked like an attractive, happy version of herself. Was it easier to age gracefully when you were a billionaire? I wouldn’t know, but presumably so. A reductive narrative had been imposed on their divorce, and that narrative certainly could have been accurate. But weren’t there other plausible narratives too? Among couples I knew, divorces were, contrary to stereotype, usually initiated by the woman, as were various nonmonogamous arrangements. And sometimes, there really wasn’t that much animosity; marriages just seemed to run their course, and even if you didn’t end up divorced, it didn’t necessarily mean that yours hadn’t. Because the Woleys’ split had some ostensibly seamy aspects that contrasted with Bryan’s general orderliness, factions of the public—comedians, social media—delighted in mocking the situation. This mockery made me feel strangely, perhaps absurdly, protective of Bryan. I understood that people were making fun of him at the available point of entry, but his leaked texts, his apparent wishes to be close to another person and for another person to find him attractive? Those texts, those wishes, were ridiculous and hopeful and vulnerable and human. The reason to criticize Bryan Woley was that he kept a million blue-collar workers toiling under the same crappy conditions that blue-collar workers had always toiled under. He had it in him to revolutionize retail shopping and cloud computing and, for God’s sake, space travel, but apparently he thought labor practices were fine the way they were. One night at dinner in the third or fourth month of the pandemic, my 10-year-old son set down the fork he was using to eat lasagna and said, “I love Pangaea.” Shortly before the meal, a multi-item delivery, ordered just the day before, had appeared on our front porch: a book about dragons for my son, toothpaste and a garden spade for me. My husband and I exchanged a glance, and I said, “Well, actually—” After a pause, I said, “Pangaea is kind of bad,” and at the same time my husband said, “Mom knows Bryan Woley. She babysat for his kids.” “If Pangaea is bad,” my son said, “why do we buy stuff from there all the time?” “Because it’s convenient,” my husband said. “Because there’s often a gap between the people we aspire to be and the people we are,” I said. “Why is it bad?” My son is a sensitive boy, red-haired and big-cheeked. Once, he asked me what veal was, and when I told him, he began to cry. “Well,” I said again. “Workers for Pangaea are expected to be as efficient as possible while they move around collecting the stuff people have ordered, and that can be hard on their bodies. One time, one of the warehouses got so hot that the workers were fainting. Or there were reports that they were so worried about not being fast enough that they peed in bottles instead of going into a bathroom.” My son looked aghast. I said, “A lot of their employees work full-time but are still considered temporary, so they don’t get health-care benefits, and that means if they go to see a doctor, the appointment is very expensive. So then maybe they just don’t go to the doctor at all.” “Mom, we should never buy anything from Pangaea again.” “On the other hand,” I said, “when I knew him, Bryan Woley was a nice guy. He wasn’t a jerk. And he recently gave $100 million to food banks.” “Well, sure,” my husband said. “Instead of paying taxes.” As he shook parmesan cheese onto his lasagna, my husband added, “Bryan Woley makes about $300 million a day, so that donation is like you giving $100 to a homeless person.” “The funny thing,” I said, “is that Bryan once offered me a job.” My husband snorted. “What, because of your coding prowess?” “That was my reaction. But they were hiring people so quickly back then, and they needed to fill nontechnical roles too.” My husband put his hands in front of his face. “I wish you hadn’t just told me this.” “Why?” “Because if you’d gotten shares of Pangaea stock in the late ’90s, even if you’d just worked there for a few years, you’d be worth tens of millions of dollars.” Was this true? Oddly, it had never occurred to me. After a few seconds, I said, “But if I’d taken that job, I’d probably never have met you, and Ian wouldn’t exist.” It was hard to tell how much my husband was kidding as he said, “Who cares? You’d be the richest babysitter in the world. Instead, you’re Pete Best.” “Who’s Pete Best?” “Exactly,” my husband said. “He’s the fifth Beatle.” This is the part I haven’t yet mentioned: The day that I saw the index card on the bulletin board outside the university career center, with the job description that Diane had written, I looked down the hall in both directions and then I removed the pin, pulled down the index card, put it in my pocket, and stuck the pin back in the board. Ten dollars an hour to look after one kid? Though I believed at the time that this act was the worst thing I’d ever done, I also didn’t see how I could behave other than ruthlessly. Almost 25 years later, I do worse things on a monthly and perhaps weekly basis. Recently, pulling out of a narrow parking spot at the grocery store, I sensed that I was too close to the car beside me, heard the brief grinding of metal on metal, and, without consciously deciding to—really, with just an instinct that I didn’t have time to deal with this, whatever this was—kept driving. Last week, I looked out my living-room window, saw a neighbor I’m not fond of, a woman in her 60s, walking past, noticed that she was wearing a cast on her left arm, and thought, Good. I then scolded myself, but again, that first reaction—it was so sincere. Both of these episodes would have been inconceivable when I was in college. And at this point, my most egregious crimes are probably those I rarely fault myself for: eating shrimp harvested by slave labor, wearing shirts made by children in other countries. As with buying products from Pangaea, I sort of know how such things reach me and sort of don’t. I intend, as I suspect most people do, to be moral, but when in the day am I supposed to research ethical sourcing of coffee grounds, and am I really expected to pay four times as much for them? Are the Woleys good and bad in the same proportions that I am, but the vastness of their wealth makes the consequences of their choices more dramatic? That Bryan is cold-blooded in his business dealings seems hard to dispute—Pangaea has indeed destroyed not only countless mom-and-pop stores but also large corporations and tiny third-party sellers—and I don’t know if this means that he once was decent and became cruel or that he was always cruel but not cruel to me, because of my proximity to his wife and children. His obsession with pleasing customers is well documented, but does he not realize that surely some of his customers and his employees are the same people? Does he ever lie awake at night and think, How the fuck did I arrive at this point? Is it relevant that, in my bed in Rockford, Illinois, I often lie awake at night and think, How the fuck did I arrive at this point? In the divorce settlement, Diane received $40 billion, which she has been giving away with notable efficiency. I doubt that either Bryan or Sophie remembers me at all, but from time to time, I wonder if Diane does; I suspect that she might, though not vividly. Then I wonder if she’s ever looked me up online, which seems even less likely. When I was their babysitter, I assumed that she’d finished her dissertation by the time she gave birth to Emily, but I later learned, in one of the few-and-far-between magazine features the Woleys cooperated with, that she hadn’t earned her doctorate until 2000. As far as I can tell, she never did anything with the degree, and I have no idea if the immensity of Pangaea, the immensity of being Bryan Woley’s wife, precluded her ability to be anything other than a philanthropist, rendering her own goals ridiculous, almost stunty. Or maybe, at least for a while, she found satisfaction in motherhood, marriage, being the private yin to his outward yang. Or maybe she is other things, and it’s just not visible. Certainly not everyone who gets a Ph.D. goes on to become a professor, and I don’t know if Diane wanted to or not. In imagining that perhaps she finds her fortune burdensome, I might be letting her off far too easily; it could be that she relishes the power such wealth provides. And yet I cannot help wondering this most of all: if my life of department meetings and strip-mall takeout and a mortgage—my ordinary life—would make her jealous."

        "story": "To those who accuse me of immoderate desire, I say look at the oil executives. Look at the Gold Rush. Look at all the women who want a ring and romance and lifelong commitment, and then look again at me. Me, I just want a person to dance the two-step with on Friday nights, a person who won’t mind if I wear a shirt with maroon sequins or, occasionally, a strap-on pregnancy bump. In return, I offer a woman who can get by on little. I keep myself spotless. My car and my nails and my résumé, I polish. I polish myself until I shine. The first thing that drew me to Len was that he had worked to be where he was and would work to stay there. Born on a cattle ranch an hour outside Gainesville, he’d made partner at an Atlanta law firm, the firm that had once represented Coca-Cola against the state. He wore a suit and tie to work even on casual Fridays. He had no southern accent. On our first date, I asked him about the accent. He said, “I did away with it.” Like it was nothing, doing away with a whole part of yourself. When I talk about polish, this is what I mean. Representing Coca-Cola is reprehensible, and I’ve told him that, but still, I admire his dedication. When I told him, on our third date, that I was trans, he said, “That makes no difference.” Another reason I love him. Not like my Nana, who had a conniption, said I was risking my job and her livelihood in the bargain, since she counted on me to take care of her. And I did lose that first job. I made mistakes. I worked a miserable job for six years just for the health insurance. But a year ago I got a part-time job, a better job, and here I am. Len didn’t care that I was trans. Now I think I should have asked for more than ambivalence, but for three years, I was happy with Len. Friday evenings, we danced the two-step at Dig Down, and he maneuvered me expertly through the crowd. Weekends, when he was feeling ambitious, he cooked crepes. He was devoted to me. His crepes were terrible. His wife, Melinda, sometimes invited me to the nail salon or for sushi. I was grateful to her for the invitations, though I always declined. We were cordial, Melinda and I. We understood how to fit together, help each other. We both believed it was a good thing, a relief, to divide up the responsibility of caring for a man. With Len, for the first time in my life, I could honestly say, “I am content.” That all ended, of course. I trace the decline to one moment four months ago. I was eating lunch with my co-worker Julie, and she asked how I was feeling at the end of my first trimester. I had most definitely not mentioned being pregnant or even wanting to be pregnant, which is something I want quietly, since it is impossible, and there’s something shameful in yearning, concretely—not a whim, but a cold, hard desire—for an impossible thing. Uterine transplants are at least six years down the road. By then I’ll be past childbearing age. I accept this, but there Julie was, acting as if I were carrying a baby, and there I was, to my great surprise, going along with it. I should have said I wasn’t pregnant, whatever she’d heard, but she smiled at me like we were sharing a new secret. She had been through two pregnancies, the second more difficult than the first. Everyone in the office knew the details. Her smile invited me to put my swollen feet up on conference tables, to send my ultrasounds to the “All” office email. Right down into my abdomen, that smile warmed me, and I said, “I feel better than ever,” and that’s how I’m in the mess I’m in now. Desire has its own rhythms. It overwhelms and subsides. At the height of my contentment with Len, I’d nearly forgotten the feeling of wanting—the pull and the thrill of it. Two years into our relationship, Len said to me, “We’re pregnant.” For a single, startled moment I thought he meant the two of us, but he was talking of course about his wife, Melinda, about the baby we hadn’t met yet, the baby who would be born to that happy couple five months later with toe-thumbs and a full head of hair. I called that baby the aphid. I cared for the aphid on Saturdays to give Melinda a break, and I enjoyed my relationship with them, which was something like that of an aunt. Melinda was a deliberate mother. She published articles on her blog about cloth diapers and raising children in nontraditional family structures. She didn’t let just anyone watch the aphid, but she let me. Maybe it was my time with the aphid that got my co-workers talking, some baby pheromone. Maybe the rumor started when I’d complained to another co-worker that I’d been nauseated in the mornings. I’d put the nausea down to starting a new plant-based progesterone or to a habit of breakfasting on Lemoncocco soda, but she’d said, “Are you pregnant?” “What do you think?” I’d said. That was a real question. Did I seem pregnant? I wanted to know. She’d just pressed her lips together into a private smile and walked away. After Julie asked about my first trimester, I started thinking about children. For three days, I thought about them. I texted Len, “Would you want to have a child with me?” “Good morning to you” I texted, “Not immediately, but one day.” “Two families is a lot” “I’m just asking if you’d want to.” When we met up that evening, I asked him again. “The logistics would be difficult,” he said. “We’d have to adopt.” “We wouldn’t have to adopt,” I said, though I couldn’t name an alternative to adoption. “I don’t think this is a conversation we need to have tonight,” he said. “I think this is a conversation we should have in a year, a few years.” I said nothing, impressed into silence by his vision of longevity. I don’t know anyone but Len who anticipates conversations they’ll have in a few years. People think contentment is a gentle thing, like bathwater, that needs only occasional replenishing to keep from turning tepid. In my experience, contentment often requires more ruthless defending. After leaving Len that evening, I defended. I went through Facebook and unfriended the yoga instructor who had posted a photo of herself nursing her 2-year-old while in a forearm stand. I unfriended the mother of two whose account had descended into outraged article shares after her husband had left her for her doula. I wrote a long Facebook post about the insensitivity of self-congratulatory motherhood. I included references to half a dozen recent articles, like “The Peak of Selflessness: Motherhood.” It wasn’t until Len called that I realized that the article about selflessness had been written by his wife. “Melinda doesn’t understand. She thought you were getting along,” he said. “We are getting along. It’s a difference of opinion. It’s not personal.” “Well, it feels personal to her.” “At any moment, Melinda could decide she doesn’t want me spending time with the aphid, and I could do nothing. How do you think that feels for me?” “Don’t call him the aphid.” “Don’t gender them.” “Melinda has asked you not to call our baby the aphid.” “At any moment, she could decide she doesn’t want me around.” “She’d never decide that.” “But she could.” “She likes you,” he said. Len often told me someone liked me. It was reflexive, a way to avoid an argument. “She thinks you’re great,” he said. “I think she’s great,” I said, which seemed beside the point. “I just need distance.” This wasn’t something I’d planned to say, but it seemed necessary to save face. He was quiet. I’d surprised him. “We thought you liked spending time with Aster.” We. A word I hated. A word that declared to the listener, You Are Not One of Us. “Melinda’s trying. She wants you to feel welcome, like part of the family.” “I’m not part of your family.” “Louie, you knew what this was when we started dating. If it’s not what you want—” “It is what I want,” I said. It wasn’t everything I wanted, but I’d long since stopped imagining that any single person could completely satisfy want in another. “We can take some time away. Like you said. We can check in next week.” I could feel the whole thing getting away from me. “Aren’t I watching Aster this Saturday?” “Do something for yourself on Saturday.” “So I’m not allowed at your house now on Saturdays?” “You just said you want distance.” “I want a family.” I waited for him to respond. “That’s not on the table, Louie. For us, for now, that’s not on the table.” So. There it was. “Let’s check in next week,” he said. I said, “Two weeks,” and he raised me to three, and I raised him, and he raised me, and then we were saying goodnight, and I was wiping the moisture from the screen of my phone and going to get Nana ready for bed, unsure if I’d see him again. It’s not easy, polishing yourself. It’s not easy teaching yourself to code or making do with cornstarch as a setting powder or going into debt for a tracheal shave. But there’s comfort in knowing you can do it, in relying only on yourself. I sat down on Saturday, when I should have been watching the aphid, and searched online for pregnancy bumps. The bumps come in a range of prices and sizes. Every one, according to the reviews, causes back pain that you need a professional to relieve. I went with the Pregnant Belly by Spirit, which shipped from South Korea and came complete with shoulder straps and an adjustable back belt. I ordered one for four to six months and one for seven to nine months. I chose express shipping. The Pregnant Belly by Spirit got good reviews for the price, though I’ve since wondered whether I should have spent more, invested in a more durable bump. When my bumps came, I modeled them for Nana. They were cold and slick against my skin. I could feel the tug of the belt, a squeeze that would escalate over hours to a backache. “That shape says you’re having a girl,” Nana said into her stew, and I was pleased in spite of myself, cupping the bump, rubbing circles into it, doting on it like people do. “Are you going to be in a play?” “People at work think I’m pregnant.” I dabbed Nana’s lips with a napkin, which came away pink with the lipstick she wears daily, even on days she doesn’t leave her bed. “And you haven’t told them otherwise?” “I’ll correct them eventually.” “Pregnancy isn’t like hepatitis. You can’t clear it up so easy. It ends in a baby.” “I could borrow a baby if I needed one,” I said, thinking about the aphid. “People will find out, Louie. You’ll embarrass yourself.” “Len and I have been talking about adoption,” I said, which was technically true. We did talk about it, though at this point we weren’t even talking that much. We sent sporadic texts—new restaurants worth trying, the dissolution of the Atlanta Silverbacks. Neither of us had suggested meeting up. Perhaps he was waiting for me. I was waiting for him. I felt a punch of sadness that Len wouldn’t see me in the bump. “Takes longer to adopt a kid than to grow one,” Nana said. “If you need an excuse for medical leave, why not hemorrhoids, something nobody’s going to ask you about?” “This isn’t about leave. It’s a misunderstanding, that’s all. It got out of hand.” She picked up her bowl and slurped the last of her broth. “Well, you better get it back in hand, Louie. Pregnancy is a temporary condition.” This is the way we spend our evenings, Nana and I. I was self-conscious my first day at work in the bump. I worried people would find the bulge at my abdomen too sudden, would sense it was a prosthetic and declare me a fraud. But no one mentioned the bump. In the developers’ meeting, as we worked our way through a demo I’d helped debug, the head developer insisted I take the chair with extra back support. Julie nodded every time I passed her cube, little knowing nods that felt like friendship. She invited me to her Code Like a Mother support group. I declined. I was not a mother-to-be. The bump wasn’t about motherhood. My pregnancy was an end in itself, the enactment of a ritual, and I approached it that way, as something real but apart, without the purpose of a usual pregnancy. I had an urge to explain this to everyone, but I didn’t. They wouldn’t understand. By the end of my first month with the bump, my backache was chronic, and the bump felt as familiar to me as my own breasts. It looked used, well loved, the silicone at the top-left edge repaired with a patch designed for inflatable pools. Weekly, I cleaned the bump with baby soap, patted it dry. Where the silicone rubbed, my skin blistered like feet in heels, blisters I soothed with Nana’s ointment. This felt like a painful, necessary process, bringing me closer to the bump, opening my insides to it. I wore the bump even to bed, sleeping on my side, curled around it. I felt more at ease wearing it, more myself. In month five, Julie wanted to throw me a shower. Julie’s a great one for celebrations. She buys cheap soccer trophies, scrounges them from yard sales, and gives them away at staff meetings. Any excuse to fill a Thursday afternoon with cake and reusable bubble letters, and Julie seizes it. I told her I’d rather not have a shower. She said she understood, but later she emailed me a link to a website with various baby-shower themes. In the subject line, she’d written, “Which one?” I didn’t respond. She sent me an email reminder for the week’s Code Like a Mother gathering, which promised nonalcoholic schnapps and prenatal yoga. That evening, as I bathed Nana, hunched over the bump, over the tub, I said, “It’s almost like your great-grandbaby.” The bump would have been her great-grandbaby. In the bathtub, Nana made a derisive sound. She dodged the cup of water I attempted to use to rinse her hair. I held the back of her neck to still her while I rinsed. When she climbed out of the tub, she put her hand on the bump. At first, I thought she just needed to steady herself, but it wasn’t a steadying touch. It was a loving one. I toweled her head, trying to dissuade the thin strands of her hair from twisting into a cowlick. “I’d name it after you,” I said. “If it was a baby.” She pulled her hand back from the bump. “Don’t you start thinking that way.” “If,” I said. I thought of the bump only as the bump. I understood the risk, the delusion—and worse, the grief—inherent in thinking of it as anything else. “I wanted another one,” Nana said, wincing as I patted down her arms, though I was gentle. “After your father, I wanted a second one. We tried and tried.” She touched the bump again. “Nothing worked?” “Back then, there weren’t so many options. You could eat almonds. You could lie for hours after sex with your pelvis tilted back and a warm compress on your stomach. I did what I could, and that was that.” “I’m sorry.” “I’m glad. I’m glad we couldn’t try and try like people these days, couldn’t go broke trying, couldn’t give whole years to it.” I felt a familiar skip of uncertainty, wondering if this was a criticism of me. “There’s nothing wrong with options,” I said. “I wouldn’t know. I’m just a country Cajun.” This was a line Nana used when she wanted to duck an argument or some responsibility, like she’d been plucked against her will out of Louisiana, dropped into a city she couldn’t possibly understand. She used it to avoid recycling and doctor appointments and public transportation of any sort. “I’m just a country Cajun” seemed self-effacing but in fact worked as a defense, a statement of withdrawal and superiority, implying that we couldn’t understand each other, because I wasn’t a country Cajun. To Nana, I wasn’t Cajun at all. “We could go back to Louisiana,” Nana said, her voice sly. “That would be one way to escape this pregnancy charade of yours.” “It’s not a charade.” “We could go to Louisiana. You could tell everyone you want to bring the baby up around family.” She wanted to move back. She wanted to visit her husband’s grave. She wanted her funeral service held at the Rose Church, where she’d gone to Mass all her life. She wanted her remains interred in the mausoleum where her mother was interred. I wasn’t moving to Louisiana. If I moved, I was heading to the West Coast, where tech companies have enough trans employees to host their own support groups. I said to Nana, “I don’t want to leave the city.” I rubbed ointment on her pressure sores. “I have a whole life here—a job, Len, friends at work, opportunities.” “There’s no opportunity that will turn that bump into a baby.” I paused, the ointment tube open in my hands. “What if it were true,” I said. “You can’t get pregnant, Louie. You know that.” I capped the ointment, took Nana’s nightgown from the hook, and slipped it over her head. “I’ve heard about a man born with a uterus,” I said. “A cis man. It’s not like it never happens.” “You know you can’t get pregnant,” she said again. “But if I could, what a thing.” “You’re caught up,” Nana said. “Preoccupied with what you want.” “I could be spending my evening in a thousand different ways,” I said, “and here I am taking care of you.” Nana didn’t reply. Nana was preoccupied with what she wanted too. After Nana’s bath, I texted Len, asking if he’d like to meet up, then I logged on to my work email and accepted Julie’s invitation to Thursday’s Code Like a Mother meeting. I wanted it to be true, what I said to Nana. I wanted to feel I could spend my evening with Nana or on a date or holding downward dog in a line of six women who were my friends. Julie responded immediately with a GIF of a child jumping up and down, punching the air. Len took 12 hours, but then wrote back, “Saturday?” Julie’s Code Like a Mother meetings took place at five in a windowless break room, the tables pushed against the walls to make space for yoga mats. The MotherCoders were six cis women in their late 30s and 40s, each recruited by Julie. The woman leading the yoga class had studied for 12 years at an ashram in California, paying for her teacher training by working remotely as a hacker for an American finance company. I was the only one there with a bump. The hacker-yogi referred to me by saying, “Those who are expecting.” At first this annoyed me, but after a few minutes I started to think about my expectations: Being brought on full-time at work. Dating someone who wasn’t Len, someone who wasn’t married. Living with that person in a house without Nana, after Nana. When the hacker-yogi told us to visualize our intent for the practice, I closed my eyes and tried to really see those things, but the bump rose instead, came up before me like a snow moon on the horizon, huge and luminous, blocking everything else from view. I opened my eyes to study the real bump in the narrow mirror that the hacker-yogi had brought so we could monitor our form. I watched myself move, and I experienced one of those precious moments in which I felt simply attractive—my clavicles delicate, my eyelashes long. Even my rosacea, which had flared as I sweat, gave me a glow. The bump moved with me, part of me. Not a false thing. A thing that served its own purpose, parallel to pregnancy, not a ghost of it, a different thing altogether. At the hacker-yogi’s instruction, I bent into a forward fold, and it was then that something popped. At my shoulder, a pop. I expected pain, but there was no pain. Just the pop and a sudden looseness at my abdomen—and certainty, a mother’s certainty, that it was the bump. Sure enough, I felt the silicone peel away from my ribs, my body instinctively sucking in a breath, which caused the silicone to peel away more quickly, sudden air sharp against skin that had been so long covered, and then the bump tipped forward, protruding oddly against my shirt. I clutched it, pressed it flat, and ran for the bathroom. I made it, just, and locked the door behind me. At the sink, one shoulder strap tore away completely, and the bump flapped forward, pocketing itself in my shirt—a sad, separate thing. I took it off. The bump settled into the concavity of the sink. I envied the sink for so easily cupping it. How long did I stand there, considering the shape of my body, bumpless? Long enough that Julie was worried. “Louie,” she called, knocking. “Louie, you okay?” This is the moment I come back to, the moment I’d change. Writing it down like this, I am changing it. I’m walking over to that bathroom door and I’m swinging it open. Julie is looking between me and the bump—me, the bump. I look at Julie’s face. Sometimes I see confusion there. Sometimes Julie watches me as I collapse in a jumble of pieces. Sometimes Julie takes up the bump without a word and helps me knot the broken shoulder strap to my bra, securing the bump, and when we’ve finished, she says, “Swiss bumps are sturdier.” Sometimes Julie laughs and laughs, and the other MotherCoders come and they laugh, and Julie takes the bump and tosses it up in the air, and the bump, miraculously light, arcs toward the ceiling and down, and then the hacker-yogi volleys it up again, and then the other women, and I run back and forth, trying to grab the bump, because every time they volley it upward, I feel the punch of their knuckles right in my abdomen. Sometimes, looking at my abdomen, Julie begins to scream, and I look down to see my shirt soaked with blood. I lift up my shirt to find a gaping wound, my abdomen skinless and bleeding, as if the bump has been sliced clean away, and I tell Julie to help me, bring me the bump, bring me a needle and thread, I will stitch the bump back to me, but Julie won’t come closer, so I’m left to stem the bleeding with the rough paper towels from the dispenser. I run through the whole roll. Of course, this didn’t happen. I didn’t open the door. “I’m okay,” I called to Julie. “Are you sure? Should I phone someone for you?” I tied the strap of the bump to my bra, the knot obvious beneath my tight shirt. It didn’t need to hold forever, just long enough to thank Julie, get to my car. I exited the bathroom. Julie immediately pressed me into a hug, which put her up against the bump. I felt it shift, slip a quarter inch against my skin, and I thought Julie would notice, but Julie just said, “You’ll be fine, you know.” I repeated those words in the front seat of my car, having waved off Julie’s offer to escort me to the parking lot. “You’ll be fine,” I told the bump, cranking up the air conditioner as high as it would go. I drove home with one hand on the bump, cradling it against my body. The bump clung to me, but not like a child. I was no seamstress, but I could patch. I could mend the bump. I took Friday off work, borrowed what I needed from Nana’s sewing kit, and retreated to my room. The mending was a private thing—not shameful, but best handled alone, like applying cream to an abdominal rash. Besides, I wanted to spend the day with the bump, just the two of us. The bump wasn’t what people thought, and that made it vulnerable. I wanted to keep the injured bump away from even Nana. I threaded a size-11 needle and pieced the shoulder strap together with a mattress stitch, the stitch that surgeons use to minimize scarring when they piece together skin. I worked steadily, enjoying the task, and I discovered when I finished that I had done well. The bump was whole, the stitches barely visible. I was to meet Len on Saturday at seven at a no-frills beer-and-wings joint, within walking distance of his house and a quick drive from mine. A significant choice, this restaurant. By suggesting it, Len had communicated his desire to make the reunion between us a nonevent. I parked on the street and sat, absently rubbing the bump, considering my options. Impossible. It was impossible that Len didn’t know about the bump. At 10 after, I got out of the car with the bump, walked to the door of the restaurant. I saw Len, seated, waiting for me. I stood on the threshold, but I couldn’t enter the restaurant with the bump. I couldn’t explain the bump to him. He would think it was about Melinda and the aphid, about himself. He would think it was pathetic. I returned to the car. Len texted, “Where are you?” I crouched in the seat as if I were engaged in some secret, sneaky behavior, like changing my pants or fucking. I slipped out of the bump’s harness. Len texted, “You coming?” I buckled the bump into the back seat. Not to protect it, but because I couldn’t leave it loose in the seat with all the other forgotten, unwanted items collected in transit. Without the bump, my sweater hung almost to my knees. Agonizing flatness. Barrenness. I nearly climbed back in the car, plastered the bump back to my body, and drove away. But Len, too, needed me, was waiting inside for me like a boy and would feel a boy’s embarrassment if I failed to show. “I’ll be right back,” I said to the bump. I tapped the window twice in farewell. Len looked up, relieved, when I paused at his table. “Thought you’d stood me up,” he said. Dinner was talk of his job and Melinda and the aphid. I tried to tell him about my life, but every story I began led me back to the bump and so had to be left unfinished. After dinner, he suggested we walk along the Beltline. That would mean hours more away from the bump, hours more spent flat in public where anyone, someone from work even, could see me. I suggested he come back to my place instead. If I was to be without the bump, I would rather be at home, unseen. I led him to my car, walking quickly to arrive before him. I checked on the bump, unclipped the seat belt fastened around it, which seemed, in his presence, to be indefensibly precious. I tossed a blanket over the bump, hiding it from him. I didn’t expect him to notice the bump. He never noticed anything in the car except the speed I was driving and if the cup holders were full, which would inhibit his drinking of an after-work beer. But on that drive, he decided he needed more legroom, and when he tried to put his seat back, the mechanism jammed, and he insisted over my protestations on taking his seat belt off, while we flew 75 down the highway, to figure out what had jammed it. I put both hands on the wheel and said, “I slam on the brakes right now for any reason, and you go through the windshield. Is that what you want?” “What’s this?” He dug around behind his seat until it slid back all the way with a jolt that made him slip sideways onto the center console. “What’s this?” he said again, sitting back in the passenger seat with the bump, tired and worn as a child’s doll, cradled in his hands. It felt like he had his hands on my belly, inside my belly, like he was mucking around with the organs in there. “It’s a pregnancy belly,” I said. I didn’t blush. “Yours?” “Whose else would it be?” He laughed. “I’ve always wanted to wear one of these. Melinda told me to get one when she was in the thick of it.” “I don’t want you to try it on,” I said, attempting to head him off, because he was already slipping the patched shoulder strap over his arm. “She didn’t think I was sufficiently empathetic, Melinda.” “Don’t try it on.” He was working the old, beloved belt apart, looking at the fuzzy, mashed Velcro. “You just strap it around your middle?” “Please don’t put it on.” “Why not?” “It’s not for you,” I said. I took it from him, tried to shove it under the back seat, out of reach. The car swerved, and he braced himself against the dash and said, “Watch the road.” He recovered the belly from the back seat. “It’s broken,” I said. “That’s okay. We’re just having fun.” I sat silently, eyes on the road, while he strapped the belly over his button-down shirt. It looked absurd there, bare, cut off from the body. He stretched and folded his arms behind his head, pleased with himself. When we pulled up to my apartment and stepped out of the car, he said, “Take a photo? For Melinda.” He fished his cellphone from his pocket, reaching awkwardly past the bump. “It’s dark,” I said, but he posed—leaning against the car sideways, so the bump was visible, flashing a thumbs-up. A couple walking by grinned. Silly. They thought we were being silly the way people infatuated with each other are silly. I nearly reached over and tore the bump off him. Instead, I took his photo for Melinda—the bump, and his grin, and behind him the car and the night, a live photo in which the bump almost seemed to move. Inside, Nana was playing double solitaire with a neighbor friend. Len, who was exasperated by Nana, who had told me multiple times that I should move her into assisted living, strutted past the women, hamming it up. They paused their game to grin and congratulate him. They wished they’d had a man who’d take turns. And who, they asked, was the father? In my bedroom, he showed me Melinda’s response to the photo of the bump—three laughing-with-tears emoji. When the ache of the back belt got to be too much, Len took the bump off and handed it to me. I went to put it away in my closet, but he said, “Don’t you want to wear it? Isn’t the whole point of having it to wear it?” “I don’t want to wear it tonight.” “Come on. I want to see you in it.” Once I, too, had wanted him to see me in it. I remembered wanting that, a remembering so strong I could nearly convince myself that I wanted to wear it tonight, that this whole thing had been my idea. I put it on in the bathroom, door closed, extra careful with the shoulder strap. When I came out, he whistled, and I almost took it off again, but he put his hands on the bump, and I could feel the vibration of his touch through the silicone, as if my nerves had extended into the bump, as if he were touching me. I wore it as we watched two episodes of Girls Get Arrested. Downstairs, Nana’s friend ran the disposal, saw Nana to her bedroom, let herself out the front door. I felt different in the bump—because it was broken or because I was in front of him. It no longer felt a part of me. It was a prop, something to make him laugh, something for him to look at, and I wore it as we had sex, me telling him, “Be careful. It’s fragile,” but still by the time we’d finished, the shoulder strap had popped again and a tear had started in the back belt, and only the adhesive of sweat and silicone kept the bump suctioned against my body, and I got to thinking about the way this all would end. I’d always known how it would end, but as I lay beside Len, the knowing became definite. I would take a week off in my seventh month. I would return with a flat abdomen and circles under my eyes. No one would ask what happened, ask me to confirm. Julie would circulate a card—something vague and reserved—Our sympathies. I tried to position this as a hopeful scenario. Still, I felt not hopeful, but overwhelmingly lonely, a loneliness intensified by Len having gone to sleep on his stomach beside me. I stood, holding the bump against me with one hand, and went downstairs, bent, clutching my abdomen in a sort of agony, as though holding on to a limb irreparably hewn from my body, unable yet to admit it was gone for good. I made my way through the quiet house to Nana’s room. There, I allowed the bump to peel away from my skin, hit the floor with a gentle bounce, inert, useless as a beetle on its back. I said, “Nana? You asleep?” She hmmed, groggy. “Who’s that?” “It’s Louie. It’s your grandbaby.” “My grandbaby. I must be getting old.” She was always disoriented at night. Her mind returned to her childhood. She scooted to the side and lifted the blanket for me, and I slid in beside her, on top of the crinkly absorbent pads. She said, “Where have you been, Gooch? You’re pretty late getting home, aren’t you? You better have a story or I’ll tell Mama you’ve been with the boys.” I turned, and I cupped her, and I sobbed three sobs, which she felt in me, and she stroked my arm with her cold, corded hand, and she said, “One of them break your heart?” with the keen interest of a younger sibling. I shook my head. It wasn’t heartbreak. It was grief. “Mama told me if you make too many tears at once, your eyeballs will float out of their sockets,” Nana said. In my sixth month, Julie did throw me a surprise office shower with bubble letters strung together to spell congratulations. I wore the second, larger bump. My co-workers navigated around the bump to hug me. I was happy there, with them. It didn’t feel like pretending. We might have been celebrating anything."

        "story": "Because Jack didn’t drive—not stick, not on the left side of the road, not at all, ever—Sadie piloted the rental car from the Dublin airport to the wedding, grinding gears and scraping along the greenery and—for a few miles—creeping behind a tractor on a winding road. It was 10 p.m. and raining. If Ireland were emerald, she couldn’t say. She would risk nothing. The tractor was a comfort, lit up with white lights. She planned to follow it as long as she could. ’Til dawn if necessary. “Pass him,” said Jack. “You pass him,” said Sadie. “I’m not driving.” “That’s right,” said Sadie. Not their wedding, but Jack’s middle sister, Fiona’s. Sadie would meet the entire family, simultaneously—Fiona and her Dutch about-to-be husband, Piet; Jack’s youngest older sister, Katie, and his oldest older sister, Eloise, and their families; and, of course, his parents, the significant Mister and Missus, Michael and Irene Valert. Jack was the youngest of all of them, the only one born in America—not American, he insisted, despite being mostly raised there. Everyone else in his family was English. He was, too, though he couldn’t pass. Sadie drove as an act of heroism, though at any moment she might swerve off the road, into a ditch or off a cliff—she wasn’t sure, she couldn’t see. In Boston, where they lived, she almost never got a chance to drive, to perform this act of casual generosity. When she did, Jack was full of gratitude and compliments, passed her snacks and drinks, read to her from magazines. They were still in the early days of their life together. This was their first wedding. “You’re a little close,” said Jack. “To the side here.” He didn’t drive, but his body acted as though it knew all about it. It braked and seized up and readied for death. The rental car was small, bright blue, a brand and model Sadie had never heard of, with some sort of winged, scaly mythical creature in the middle of the steering wheel. The wedding would be in a large Irish house near the town of Clonmel. There was nothing for it but to drive. The good news was that the house belonged to Fiona and Piet, who’d bought it for a song after its occupant had died in one of its many rooms, so the whole family could stay there for free, and once there, they could drink without worry. That of course was also the bad news, all those hours she would have to perform as herself in front of Jack’s family. They had flown all day, through the air and through time zones, and now it was the middle of the night. “We’ll miss supper,” said Jack. “We’ve missed it.” “We’ve missed it. That’s all right.” The Irish winds pushed at the little car and Sadie leaned forward, as though the road itself were a map she couldn’t read—no, not as though. It was. “How are you doing?” asked Jack. “I’m fine!” she said in a cheerful voice. The voice of her mother, she realized, who was cheerful when things were dire. From her mother she’d also accepted, unthinkingly, the advice that you should always buy the full car insurance when driving on the wrong side of the road, so she had, thank God, because the car was already scratched down one side and would probably lose a side-view mirror. The tractor slowed them down, but so did Sadie’s sense that in the dark, Ireland was making itself up as it went along, Jack giving directions at the last minute, sometimes consulting a map and sometimes an old envelope upon which he’d written notes. Finally they arrived and pulled up the long drive. They could make out the dull shape of the dark house amid the trees and mist. “It’s a mansion,” said Sadie. “It’s a Georgian cube,” said Jack. Outside the car, the rain was friendlier than it had been on the car windows—over friendly, wet and insinuating, running its fingers through their hair and down the backs of their collars. They left their luggage in the car and ran for the front door, which had a mammoth Dickensian knocker, ready to morph into somebody’s face, but whose? Jack shouldered the door open. Then they were in a dim foyer illuminated by a night-light: a black-and-white Vermeer floor and five doors. It felt like a puzzle. There was a lion behind one of those doors, Sadie was sure, and a happy future behind another, and a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni behind a third. The Rice-A-Roni door opened to reveal a small woman holding a flashlight, dressed like a stable boy, or in what Sadie imagined a stable boy might wear, corduroy pants tucked into rubber boots, a sweater that surely had been handed down by a careless person with a lot of money: brown cashmere with unraveling cuffs. “This way,” she said in a stage whisper. “Hello!” “Hello!” whispered Jack. “We’ve put you in the snug, just for tonight,” she whispered. “Hope that’s all right. Tomorrow some family is shifting to the hotel downtown to get ready. You can take our room then.” They followed her to a tiny room in the middle of the house that was almost entirely taken up by a bed. “Air mattress, but it’s a good one. The electric blanket’s on. Poor things,” the woman said. “You must be shattered.” “We are,” said Jack. “We’ll meet properly in the morning,” the woman said. “Lenny, your hair’s hilarious. It’s quite big, isn’t it?” He raised his hands and felt his head. “This is Sadie,” he said. “It’s lovely to meet you, Sadie. See you in the morning.” The woman went out a door opposite the door they’d come in. The house was silent all around them. “Why’d she call you Lenny?” asked Sadie. “Because it’s my name.” He gave the air mattress a kick. “My actual name. Leonard. You know that. My family calls me Lenny. I hate it.” “I knew it was your name but I didn’t know it was your name,” she said. “I hate it,” he repeated. She felt wild with various discomforts. “I need to pee.” They were in a room with three doors: the one they’d come in, the door through which the woman had left, and a door to the outside with windowpanes. The rain seemed to patter at all of them. “It’s too confusing,” said Jack. “Go outside.” “Go outside?” She opened the door they’d come through, only to be faced with half a dozen other doors, all closed. She might find a toilet behind any of them, or a sleeping stranger. Already Jack had opened the back door. “Well, I’m having a slash outdoors,” he said. “Easy for you to say.” “G’wan,” he said. “G’wan, g’wan, g’wan.” Could be worse, she told herself. She was wearing a dress, so she took off her coat and her tights and her underpants and went out in the rain. It was cold but she was cold; she could hardly get any colder. “You done with your slash?” she asked. “Done.” “Here, give me your hand. Is your entire family here?” “I imagine.” “Are they watching me pee in the rain?” “Without a doubt.” “Who was that lady?” “That lady was the bride. Fiona. Did I not say?” “You did not. Okay. Done.” Inside Jack found a little lamp to switch on, clamped to the edge of a stepladder. The walls were vivid green, and he looked like a Toulouse-Lautrec lady, lit from underneath, glamorous, sure to die or go blind or mad. The idea of an air mattress and an electric blanket had sounded like a disaster to Sadie, but she put her underpants back on and took off her wet dress and used it to dry her wet knees and then, cold to the bone, she slid in. She’d never slept under an electric blanket. It was warm, and a comfort, and she felt like a little abandoned animal whose mother had died but who might yet be saved by technology. Incubated. That’s how she felt. Maybe she would be electrocuted and maybe the air mattress would spring a leak and they would sail around the room as it emptied out. For the moment, she had never felt anything more exquisite, this warm little raft heading out to sleep. Hours later she heard the noise of children, and then a barking voice saying, “No, Thomas, no, they’re asleep; no, Pie, come here, you’ll play piano later.” The daylight was sodden. The rain had stopped, but she could hear water dripping. Next to her was a paint-splattered upright piano. The electric blanket was cold. The air mattress had lost a little air, but they were still afloat. “Ireland,” said Jack. “Still?” said Sadie. “Yes, and for days.” She fell back asleep. When she woke next, she heard voices behind all the doors, left, right, at the head of the bed. She was in her underwear, locked in a secret room surrounded by Jack’s family. By God, she should have passed that tractor, been braver, driven right through Clonmel to Dingle Peninsula, on the other side of the country. Dingle. What a name for a beautiful place. She had never been there, but a high-school friend had once sent her a postcard from the beach of Inch. “Jack,” she said. Jack wasn’t there. He was already out, goddamn him. She said to herself, in a whisper, “Lenny.” No curtains at the back of the house. But he’d spread out her dress on the ladder, and it was halfway dry, so she put it on and stood next to the mattress—she had to tick her toes beneath it to fit—and listened for his voice. There it was, and the sound of pouring coffee. Or pouring tea. She hoped it was coffee. He was talking to other people. She couldn’t possibly go out there. Perhaps if she went out the door to the hallway, she could find her way to the car and her luggage and her toothbrush. Behind the door was the black-and-white hallway, and at the front end of it, a barefoot man looked out a window. He turned to her. He wasn’t English—something about the spikiness of his haircut and the severity of his square steel glasses. He had a sandwich in his hand. “Hallo,” he said, and then, in a calm European voice, “Did you mean to leave the car door open?” “What? No!” “There is a cat and a dog,” he said. “Inside your car.” Her shoes were still by the door, moist as oysters. She put them on. Awful. “A cat and dog,” she said. It had been raining cats and dogs; she believed he’d spoken metaphorically. But he hadn’t. The driver’s-side door was open, and a Shetland sheepdog jumped out onto the drive. Already a Siamese cat was picking its way along the cobblestones toward the front garden. “So you see,” said the man, who had followed her in his bare feet. He closed the car door for her. “I’m Piet.” “Sadie,” she said. “Are—is that your dog?” “Neighbors, maybe? I don’t know. Not yours? You didn’t bring us a cat and a dog from America?” In the daylight she could see that they were at the top of a hill, other hills in front of her in various degrees of fog and sparkle. “Do you think they spent the whole night there?” Piet nodded. “I like to think so, yes.” “Like a children’s book,” she said. The humiliating feeling of having been so exhausted that she’d left the door open in a rainstorm evaporated. Where else would the animals of Clonmel take shelter? It must be a good sign. An odd and happy marriage, after all. But whose sign was it? Piet ripped his sandwich in two and handed an unbitten portion to her. “Breakfast,” he said. Dizzily, she bit into it. She had been expecting ham, but it was sweet and delicious and crunched under her teeth. “Strawberry,” said Piet. “Butter, sugar.” He felt his chin. “I suppose I am getting married and should shave.” “The wedding’s here?” “The wedding’s at church,” he said philosophically. “I could be married on a rock, by a buzzard or a bear, but not Fiona. She believes in God. ‘God is everywhere,’ I told her, ‘don’t you think?’ But I am an atheist, and so my opinions on God do not matter.” He carried her bag into the house and pointed her to the bathroom, which had a toilet unconvincingly attached to the wall and a claw-foot tub belly-up in the corner, awaiting its installation. The sink worked. Her toothbrush had rubbed up against something soapy in her cosmetic bag, and it tasted of mint, perfume, and incompetence. She changed into a clean dress, a pair of leggings, clean socks; stowed the suitcase in the snug; draped her dirty, damp clothing over the top; and went around the long way to follow the sound of voices to a kitchen. There was Jack leaning against a yellow enameled stove, surrounded by English people, all of them dressed like stable hands. He was still in yesterday’s clothing (sleeping in it had achieved the correct level of rumpled). The room smelled of cigarettes and sausage. She studied Jack’s face for some evidence of guilt over abandoning her. Instead he said, “There she is!” She went to him but he did not—as he would have in America—put his arm around her. “Sit,” he said to her, his voice full of kindness; she could tell how happy he was to see her. “Sit, sit. What can I get you? Let me make you some coffee. This is Sadie,” he said to the assembled English. They were all women, with the exception of one small boy, who abruptly opened the door to the snug and began to bang on the piano, and a man with giant hands, who was putting dishes away in a cupboard. These were people who called Jack “Lenny.” They looked just the sort. “Sadie, you’ve met Fiona, and here’s Katie and Eloise, my other sisters. That’s Katie’s husband, Paul.” Together Jack and his sisters looked like the full toolbox: hatchet, knife, spade, trowel. Sadie, having been sat, understood that she was not to make physical contact with any of the people present. She was about to say hello when an older man came through a door in the corner of the room, shaking water from his hands. Jack’s father—it had to be—with Jack’s thick curls, though whiter and tidier. He was a tall man, serrated—Sadie felt cut already, as she would always feel around him—with extraordinarily blue eyes that he must have been vain about. He wore a sweater one shade darker, peacock, to bring them out. “Still there!” he said in a jubilant voice. “For fuck’s sake,” said Jack. “It’s not!” said the woman who’d let them in. Fiona. The bride. She was washing dishes and smoking a cigarette. “It can’t be.” “Well done, Lenny,” said their father. “What?” said Sadie. “I think it’s a lovely present that Len has brought,” said Jack’s father. Then he winced. Paul at the cupboards noticed the wincing. “Pie,” he shouted into the snug. “Stop torturing that piano.” The piano stopped for half a second, then started again with more deliberation. “A work of art, really,” said one of the sisters. Sadie looked at Jack. He shook his head. “A very honored wedding guest,” said Fiona. “Do fuh-kawf,” said Jack, in one of the exaggerated English accents he sometimes slid into. He had dozens of them, similar but for subtly different uses, like the blades of a penknife. He added, “Would you?” “The lingering log of Len,” said Jack’s father. Then the little boy was back, and said to Sadie, with the same jubilation, “It’s a turd won’t flush!” He set his hand on Sadie’s knee. She had never been so glad for a human touch in her life. The assembled Valerts laughed, silently. It was a laugh Sadie recognized from Jack: To make noise would ruin the joke. “It is tenacious,” said Fiona. “It’s quite a tenacious turd.” “Oh, that’s right,” Jack’s father said to Sadie, as though noticing her for the first time. He regarded her with an intensity she couldn’t interpret. Kindly? Aggressive? Flirtatious?  “Americans don’t appreciate the scatological, do they?” “We do,” said Sadie, thinking, I don’t. The kitchen table was at an angle to the walls and it gave her a headache. She could feel the sugar from the strawberry sandwich in her molars. How far was town? Could they get out of there? She looked up at Jack. “Coffee?” “I’ll make some.” “This is my father,” said Fiona, squinting at the smoke from her own cigarette. “Daddy, this is Sadie. I’m sorry you won’t meet my mother.” “No?” said Sadie to Jack.  “She’s unwell,” said Michael Valert. “Rotten timing.” It was his eyes that confused things, so startlingly blue that they seemed to hold every emotion and its opposite. “You must be absolutely shattered,” he told her. “Not too bad.” “All that driving. I’d be shattered. I am shattered.” “S’shame,” said Jack. “About Ma.” “Can’t be helped,” said Fiona. “We’ll video.” Jack set a cup of coffee on the table. The little plastic jug in front of her was marked milk. “Cream?” she said to Jack. He shook his head. “I’m going to help Piet set up the tables for the reception. You all right?” She nodded. She understood that she would be, in some way, abandoned to these English people. “What can I do to help?” she asked the room at large. “Nothing to do,” said Fiona. She dropped her cigarette down the neck of a beer bottle on the counter, which was already filled with cigarettes. “The Dutch have it in hand.” “We’re going for a walk, if you’d like to come,” said Eloise. “That sounds nice.” “You can borrow a pair of boots and a raincoat.” As Sadie passed Michael Valert, he said, “It’s a large turd. Impressive. You must be feeding him well.” The boots wouldn’t go over Sadie’s thick calves, so she put on her wet shoes, a pair of rubber-soled Mary Janes. The coat wouldn’t button over her hips, so she wore it open. By “we” Eloise had meant herself and a small, wild-eyed, disheveled terrier who looked like the dog in The Arnolfini Portrait and whose name was, apparently, Shithead. Sadie followed the two of them out the door, across a field, and then, alarmingly, up a hill. “It’s an amazing house,” said Sadie, to prove to Eloise that she wasn’t too out of breath to talk. “Why Ireland?” “Why indeed. Apparently they like the Irish. I think they’re mad to have bought it.” “Why?” “It’ll take them donkey’s years to fix it up. Not to mention the cost. They’re not very practical. Here, let’s go this way.” Eloise opened a gate that said Beware of bull. “Come on.” Sadie pointed at the sign and said, “Bull?” Eloise’s hat was large and tweed. It had fallen over her eyes; she knocked the brim up with her fist and scanned the field. “Look,” she said. “He’s over there. Come on! Don’t be wet.” “I’m—they move fast, don’t they?” “He won’t bother us. Come on, Shithead,” she called in a sweet, threatening voice. “Shitty! Shitty.” The dog crossed first and they followed, and then climbed through some barbed wire, which caught in Sadie’s hair. She could feel the soggy shoes tugging at her leggings, the waistband of which had fallen below the equator of her bottom. She slid in the mud. At the moment she thought Eloise was purposefully testing or torturing her, but eventually she would learn that this was simply every walk in the country with every English person she would ever meet: mud and injury and a disregard for safety and private property. “What do you do?” she asked Eloise. The hat was down again; she knocked it up again. “Really? I’m a doctor. Len didn’t tell you?” “Of course!” she said, though he hadn’t. “I meant what kind of doctor.” “Nephrologist.” Sadie looked at her watch. “What time is the wedding?” “Five.” “It’s one.” “’Tis,” said Eloise. “Does Fiona need help? Getting ready? If your mother’s not here.” “The Dutch will do that. They’re very good, the Dutch. Why, are you tired? We can go back. Lenny’s told me all about you.” “Oh,” said Sadie. “Sorry your mother’s not here.” “She’s got gout.” “Really?” “You think she’d lie?” “No. I just—I guess I didn’t realize women get gout.” “Runs in families,” said Eloise, and Sadie realized there was nearly nothing that Eloise did not deliver as a threat. “This way.” They seemed to be angling back down the hill. She thought it was a hill; it might have been a mountain. “Lucky it stopped raining.” “Ground’ll be wet for the wedding.” “Are there roofs over the stables?” “Yes,” she said. “But for the dancing there’s not.” “There’s dancing?” “The Dutch will want to dance, surely,” said Eloise. “And you. Americans are always dancing, aren’t they? Shitty!” called Eloise, in a headmistress voice. “Shithead! Get over here.” Then, carelessly, “I hope you weren’t bothered.” “Oh gosh, no,” said Sadie. “By what?” “My father. He has a childish sense of humor.” At the house, they went in a door at the back, yet another one. Eloise bundled the dog in a dirty pink towel the color of a tongue, then tucked him under her arm. “Do you want a tour?” “Sure.” “We’ll take the back stairs.” Like servants do, thought Sadie, who’d read enough books about English girls in peril to wonder whether she was about to be shut in an attic. Some rooms were still derelict and some under construction, but absolutely nothing was finished. Until recently, the house had been owned and occupied by a single old man, who had died alone in one of the bedrooms. Somebody, perhaps the old man when he was a young man, had painted all of the walls with vivid tempera paint, which gave the rooms the intense look of Renaissance frescoes—brand-new, ancient, like marriage itself—and which would, come evening, rub off against the clothing of wedding guests who got too close. The old man’s bedroom was blue. Lapis lazuli, thought Sadie. Had his family died? His wife, his children? But the old man had never married; it had been his parents and brother and sisters who had died or disappeared, one at a time. No man who’d ever been married could have died thus: alone but perfectly happy in his bed, a portrait of the Virgin Mary hung at an angle so he didn’t have to hurt his neck to look at her. “Sad to die alone,” said Sadie. “How do you know?” asked Eloise. She set the dog on the ground. He sniffed at the threshold of the room but didn’t go in. “I’m longing for it. But instead I will be surrounded by my children and grandchildren.” “Oh!” said Sadie. “You have children.” “Grown,” said Eloise. “Elsewhere.” Then, in an exaggerated English accent, though her own accent was already extremely English, “Gawn.” Sadie noticed her suitcase in the corner of the room, Jack’s next to it. Her bag had been repacked, closed up. She hoped Jack had been the one who’d done it. She suspected he hadn’t. The tub in the upstairs bathroom was only partially installed; it was waiting for an exterior wall to hide the fiberglass form. There were unsecured sinks in odd places. The floors were wood, dusty, the varnish worn away. Everything felt precarious but also beautiful—an excellent place, thought Sadie, for starting a life together. “What did you get as a present?” Eloise asked. Sadie was happy to say. It had been her idea. “A guest book,” she said. “For the house.” They had ordered it from Smythson, leather-bound, with the name of the house—Currock House—stamped in gold on the cover. “What?” said Eloise. Sadie didn’t know what misstep she’d made. Were you not supposed to reveal wedding presents before the wedding? But Eloise had asked! “That’s what I got,” said Eloise. “You’ll have to get something else.” “Well,” said Sadie. “Lottie’s invited,” said Eloise suddenly, as though the matter had been settled. “I’m sure Lenny said.” “The clown?” At that, Eloise laughed. It was a disconcerting laugh; you could see her tongue move with every peal, a rapid clapper in a bell. “Not a clown, no.” “Oh, that’s right. Puppets. Right?” “You don’t know about Lottie! He worshipped her. But I’m sure he’s told you.” He had mentioned Lottie—that she was older than he was, that they’d busked together on the streets of London. Not a girlfriend; just a woman. He’d been a teenager when they met. When Sadie thought of it, their act was in the jittery black-and-white of long ago. But he’d never spoken of worship. Her ankles were sore. She wondered if there was somewhere to take a nap, or even time enough. “You must make him tell you about Lottie,” said Eloise. “It’s important.” “All right,” said Sadie. She crouched to pat the dog. “Hello, Shithead.” “His name,” said Eloise, “is Seamus.” “Oh! I thought—” “Shithead’s his nickname,” said Eloise, fondly, to the dog. The wedding was at five, with a reception to follow. Most of the party went to the hotel in town to get ready, but the broke relatives—Sadie and Jack, Katie and Paul and their twins—stayed behind. Sadie and Jack got ready in the blue bedroom, where the old man had died. “Where’s my bag?” said Jack. They had not been together long enough to pack in the same suitcase. “Here. Is your family always like that?” “English? Yes.” “Obsessed with shit.” He laughed. “Right. English. That didn’t bother you, surely.” “I’ve had anxiety dreams that were more relaxing. Shame about your mother’s gout.” “Gout? No gout. Where did you get gout?” “Eloise said.” “Yes, she would. No: The problem is that Fiona converted to Catholicism and is now marrying an atheist.” “Which is worse?” “Hard to tell.” “How’s being Jewish?” she asked. “If she’s against Catholics.” “You’re not Jewish.” “I am Jewish. Are you in the wedding party?” “No.” “What’s with the suit?” He was stepping into striped pants. “It’s my morning suit. It’s what you wear to weddings.” “You own that suit?” “Yes,” he said. Then, “Your mother’s Jewish.” “Yes, my mother’s Jewish, so I’m Jewish.” “Says who?” “Jews the wide world over. Didn’t you know that? Matrilineal, mate.” “Huh,” he said. “Don’t call me mate. No, I think she’d be fine with that. You didn’t choose it, after all.” “But what if I did?” “Sadie,” said Jack. “What about Lottie?” “She wasn’t Jewish.” “Did you know she was invited to the wedding?” At that Jack smiled, but he also began to arrange his hair, his major vanity, the dark curls that he wore swept off his forehead. “No, she’s not,” he said. “Eloise said she was.” He laughed with some relief. “Don’t believe what Eloise says.” “She says you worshipped Lottie.” “Bollocks I did.” “I love it when you speak British. And you didn’t sleep together.” “Not often.” Sadie laughed, but Jack didn’t. “Not often,” he said again. “Near the start or near the end?” He took his hands from his hair. “Right near the middle,” he said. When they drove up to the church, they were already rushed. “Why does the car smell of wet dog?” he asked, and Sadie thought, Was that today? It seemed like weeks ago. She hadn’t had a chance to tell him the story, which she knew would delight him; it had slipped her mind. She parked the car. “Does it?” “Remember the emergency brake,” he told her. “I always do,” she said, though she’d forgotten. Inside the church they were hustled up to a front pew by a Dutch person in a red-denim blazer. Nobody had to ask bride’s side or groom’s: The English were the ones in floral prints and hats and morning suits, and the Dutch were the ones in long braids and primary colors. Sadie turned to see if she could pick out Lottie among the guests, but all she could see were hats, an armada of them. The wedding, being a wedding, passed without incident. Afterward, they had drinks in the checker-floored foyer of the house, with plates of pâté and toast handed around. The tempera paint on the walls rubbed off on people. The twins’ hands were blue. Shithead’s port side was green. The guests who got too close to the yellow walls came away looking pollinated. “My mother would hate this,” said Jack. “Better she stayed at home.” “Do you like weddings?” said Sadie. “No,” he said. Then, “Lucky for us we’re already married.” Sadie laughed ruefully. “That drunk guy,” said Jack. “From the bar. Our first date. Didn’t he pronounce us man and wife?” “I don’t think he was credentialed.” “He might have been a ship’s captain. Do you like weddings?” She thought about it. The answer was no, but she thought she might like marriage. “I don’t know,” she said. “They’re all right. No,” she said. “No. I don’t.” “I didn’t think so.” She was crying then. “Oh, no!” he said, startled. “No! What’s the matter?” The matter was she felt, all of a sudden, the force of the Valerts, and understood them as quicksand, and didn’t know whether she should get herself out or try to rescue both of them. Eloise, the father, even darling Fiona, even Katie and Paul’s twin sons, with their Rod Stewart haircuts and old-man outfits that matched those of Jack’s family. She’d understood matching clothing—tracksuits, Disneyland sweatshirts, striped pajamas—as a particularly American insanity. She didn’t like the international version any better. “I’ll ask you one of these days,” he said, fond and irritated. “When I get some things straightened out.” She was astonished that he understood so little. After all the rain, they had a beautiful night. The ground was muddy, but the stables were paved and covered and strung with fairy lights. There was no dancing—dancing had been canceled, because it had been planned for the field and the field was muck. “Like the Somme,” observed Michael Valert to Sadie, daring her to get the reference, which she did not. There was no seating plan, just long tables laid out. It had been a small wedding. Eloise was weeping. She had seen the guest book that Jack and Sadie had bought. “It’s nicer,” she said to her father. “No, it’s not, I’m sure it’s not.” “It is!” she said. Then she was crying into his shoulder, and Fiona was there, too, and they were all comforting Eloise, whose grown gawn children hadn’t come. “It can be a different kind of guest book!” said Fiona. “Yours is lovely.” She looked at Sadie. “They’re both lovely!” Michael Valert had to play emcee at dinner, because Piet’s best man was a small, shy Dutch woman named Kick who’d refused. Jack and Kick went off to smoke a cigarette, but Michael Valert didn’t care. He assumed his position at the microphone, and offered a toast that referenced, among other things, the morning shit that hadn’t flushed, a number of jokes about the Dutch, one about the French—it turned out that Eloise’s long-ago-divorced husband had been French—and one about an unarmed American, who, Sadie realized with surprise, was her. “To the bride and groom!” said Michael Valert. She was at a table with the unmarrying sisters. The blond twins played mumblety-peg with a butter knife and their sweet, blue hands. “Which one’s Pie?” Sadie asked. “They both are,” said Eloise. “Easier that way.” Instead of a cake, there were three Dutch cheeses in graduated sizes. Where was Jack? Michael Valert announced into the microphone, “The bride and groom will now cut the cheese.” Now that, thought Sadie, was funny, and she burst into delighted laughter. That was how she discovered that the euphemism was only American, and she the only American there. Jack was American, too, of course, no matter how he denied it, but Jack was elsewhere. When Sadie realized that everyone in the stables was looking at her, she began to laugh harder. Her laughter was not silent. She could hear herself shriek. “What is it?” hissed Eloise, and Sadie could only manage to say, “It means f-f-fart.” Across the stable, Michael Valert stared at her with his exceptionally blue eyes, as amplified as his voice had been, and for a moment she felt ashamed, but then, as though her soul had been turned over with a spade, the shame turned to absolute joy. She could have stood and sung, she thought, though she could not sing. Indeed the bride and groom had cut the cheese. Fiona’s dress was scallion green, and glorious. The Dutch had put too much gel in her hair. That night they slept in the room of the dead man—what if he’d died in this bed, asked Jack, and Sadie, brave for once, said, “People have died everywhere, you can hardly avoid it, come here”—and tomorrow they would drive to Dingle Peninsula, and she would think, over and over, I am going to drive off this road and ruin everything, but she never did, and she told him about the cat and dog, and explained to him that she thought his father had purposely made a funny joke—the bride and groom will now cut the cheese!—and then they both laughed so hard that she had to pull over to the side of the road, and when they recovered, they drove out to Inch, where they were the only people on the beach, and so quickly and laughingly had sex on the damp sand, there was not a place in all of Ireland that wasn’t damp, but what else do you do when you are all alone, and liberated? For now, when Jack came back to the table, he found Sadie laughing so hard that she couldn’t speak, and his family arrayed around her. She was crying with laughter, and every time she tried to explain, she laughed harder, and his family looked more appalled. “What is it?” asked Jack, who felt suddenly the depths of his love for her, like Pavlov’s dogs, all of them in love with Pavlov. “Why is that woman laughing?” Michael Valert said into the microphone. “Tell her to stop!” said Eloise. “Make her stop!” But he couldn’t, and she couldn’t either.

        "story": "He waits three weeks for his father to respond. During that time, whenever he checks the mail, the dog follows him. She eyes the birds on the telephone wires. Then the migrant workers in the fields. One day, the payphone near the mailboxes rings. He hurries to the booth. But it is a woman from Vladivostok conducting a survey of the Korean communities in the Russian Far East. The surveyors have been calling ever since Russia’s first president was elected. He usually hangs up, but today he doesn’t. The dog lies down beside him as he answers all her questions. No, I don’t work on the barley farm. No, we rent the house. Yes, the electricity goes out often. Yes, the water tastes tinny. Yes, we have a store for basic groceries, but the nearest town is an hour south. Yes, he lies. I go to school. No, I don’t use the payphone often. “Why?” the surveyor says. “Because you have to pay.” He hears her writing. Listening to her voice, he tries to remember the voice of his father. “What’s your name?” the surveyor asks. “Maksim.” “How old are you?” “Sixteen.” “How many people are in your household, Maksim?” Maksim begins to count the people who live in the row of houses next to the farm until he realizes the woman is referring to only his family. Maksim says, “Two in our household,” knowing that is no longer true. He hangs up. The noise startles the dog awake. The dog follows Maksim back to the house, and once he is safely inside, she bolts into the field toward the far woods. She is no one’s dog, but for the past few weeks she has followed only him. He leaves the door open for her. His uncle would have never allowed that, but his uncle is three weeks dead, so what does it matter now? Maksim is like the dog. He does what he wants. He wears what he wants to wear and eats when he wants to eat. He doesn’t make up the mattress on the floor, and it doesn’t matter if he knocks over a glass, waking himself up from a dream he keeps having in which people are speaking to him in different languages he has never heard before. There is no one to explain the dream or to chastise him or to tell him to go to the corner store and see if there is work so that he can earn some money for the house. There are only his uncle’s things everywhere: his baseball cap on the wall hook, his tin mug and his stack of car magazines in this one-room house Maksim has lived in for longer than his father has been away. There is the door always swinging open from the wind that comes at the end of summer, and outside the barley that hasn’t had rain in a long time, long enough for Maksim to know that it has been a bad year; a bad year after several and there is talk of the migrant workers not returning. Through the doorframe, he can still see the tire tracks of his uncle’s taxicab. The company came the other day and towed it. As his neighbors watched, the truck driver tossed a road map to Maksim and told him it had been in the taxi’s glove compartment. Maksim waited until he was alone before opening the map, wondering if by chance something else was folded in it, some secret message for him. But it was only a map, one his uncle hardly ever used because he knew the roads. In the mailbox yesterday was a letter telling Maksim that his uncle owes money for the cab. Next month, Maksim will owe rent for the house. For the fourth time this week, he heads out to the corner store to ask the owner if he can do anything today. The owner ignores him and opens boxes of instant ramen as the newscaster on the television describes a skirmish at the border with Chechnya. Then the man tosses Maksim a ramen pack and says, “Why do you all keep eating only this shit?” Later, Maksim opens the map again, but Chechnya isn’t there. Sakhalin Island is there. East of where he is, next to the Sea of Japan. It is 950 kilometers long and 160 kilometers wide. It is like a giant, leaping fish. He draws a route from the mainland coast to the island coast, 100 kilometers back and forth, he reckons, and then spots a town called Terney on the mainland that he can get to in a few hours. Maksim doesn’t know if his father still works on Sakhalin or if he got the letter telling him that his brother, Maksim’s uncle, is dead. He doesn’t know what his father’s favorite food is anymore. Whether he is fat or thin or speaks in Russian or Korean most days. Maksim’s father left for the island five years ago. Or was told to leave. Maksim has not seen him since. The wind blows in. He cooks the ramen in the microwave, staring at the calendar marked up with his uncle’s handwriting, unable to decipher it. Today is the last day of August. The month ends. The mailbox stays empty. Two days later, shutting the door behind him, Maksim walks to where the migrant workers are climbing onto the bed of a pickup truck and asks whether he can catch a ride with them. The workers are Koreans from Uzbekistan, and they have been coming here for years. They are heading east, he knows, to another farm, before they head south for the winter. Maksim is standing on the road with a backpack on his shoulders. He is wearing a denim jacket and his uncle’s baseball cap. Maksim holds out some money he had been keeping under his mattress, but the Uzbek closest to him says to keep it. In Korean, the Uzbek says they were sorry to hear about Maksim’s uncle, that the man used to give them free rides. Then the workers help Maksim up and ask where he wants to go. “Terney,” he says. As the truck begins to move, the dog leaps up onto the bed. The Uzbeks laugh. The dog looks up again at the birds on the wires as they all leave the farm. “Your father still on the island?” The Uzbek beside him is shouting over the wind. They are speeding through a forest with a high canopy. “Is he still at the camp?” Maksim isn’t sure what they think of his father, so he just nods, holding the dog as the truck shakes. Maksim’s father is a prison guard. Or the last time they spoke he was, working at the prison on the island. The older people call it “the camp” because it was a labor camp run by the Japanese, when the Japanese claimed the southern half of the island. They rounded up thousands of Koreans during wartime and brought them there to log, pulp paper, mine coal. Maksim’s grandfather had been one of the laborers when he was in his 20s. When the war ended, many of them, including Maksim’s grandfather, never went back home. They took a boat west, first to Vladivostok, then eventually headed inland, north, where they settled. That is their family story. That is the story of almost all the families who rent on the farm. Maksim has always been aware of the strangeness of his father going to work where his own father had been imprisoned. He once asked his uncle about it, but his uncle only said, “Better your father there than here,” and left it at that. They ride the rest of the way in silence. The forest turns into meadows and then into hills and dunes. Then, suddenly, the smell of the sea. Seabirds. When they pull into Terney, the Uzbek he was talking to hands him a piece of paper with an address near Vladivostok. He tells Maksim that they aren’t sure there will be work at the farm next year—and that if things don’t work out for Maksim, he should come to them. “We will see each other again,” the Uzbek says. The dog leaps down, following Maksim. Together they enter the hill town, heading directly to the coast. The afternoon air is sandy and cold and full of a heavy sound he doesn’t yet realize is the movement of water. He has been on the road for only two hours and already he feels a world away. He grips the straps of his backpack and feels a rush of relief that the dog is here. He ducks under clotheslines. The dog steals some water from a bucket. Other dogs eye her, then vanish into alleys. He avoids looking at the windows. It occurs to Maksim that he doesn’t know the route his father took to the island. For many years now, he has imagined him in a guard uniform gripping a club and has wondered how the club has changed the way he strikes men. Maksim’s greatest fear as a child was that his father would one day use a kitchen knife. He finds a path to the beach. The dog is elated. She bounds into the water and back as Maksim walks on the sand, listening, watching. He comes upon some wooden houses, a restaurant, and then a garage in which surfboards lie stacked on a rack. He returns to the restaurant. A gray-haired woman stands behind the bar, wiping the counter. Her eyes have a steadiness that makes him feel at ease, and so he asks, in Russian, whether she knows of anyone with a boat. She considers him and then points out toward the cliff and says that if he keeps going, he’ll find the fishermen. So he keeps going. He walks past some large rocks sticking up out of the water like miniature islands. When he reaches the base of the cliff, he spots the motorboats pulled up on the beach. In the shadow of the cliff is a cluster of shacks. The ocean sound is louder here, and everywhere. If someone were behind him, he wouldn’t know. He turns. When he turns again, a group of people is approaching him from the shacks. “That your dog?” “She’s no one’s dog,” Maksim says. “Then I guess we can take her,” a man says. Maksim is silent. The dog stands rigid and is also silent. A woman is standing behind the group of men, smoking a cigarette, looking bored. Maksim asks if these are their boats. When the men don’t respond, Maksim asks if one of them could take him to Sakhalin. “I can pay,” Maksim says. Another man asks if he is Japanese. That the Japanese keep coming here with their surfboards and Jet Skis. “We don’t want your Japanese money,” they say. But then a moment later they say, “Prove you’ve got the money.” The dog snarls. Maksim quickly turns and hurries away. He counts to 30. For every number he takes a step. Twenty-eight … step … 29 … step … He spins around, his hands clenched. The group hasn’t moved, but they’ve lost interest in him. Now he is alone. He and the dog. He approaches the large rocks he passed and begins to walk out into the water. From the shore, the dog watches. The rocks are slippery, but Maksim keeps going, treading carefully. He goes as far as he can without the waves splashing all over him and squints out into the vast nothing, searching for the island or even Japan. Maybe he will try heading farther down the beach in the opposite direction and ask someone else. Or maybe he will try another town on the coast. He thinks of his uncle trying to teach him to swim one year but can’t remember which beach they were on. Only that his uncle ended up swimming on his own and Maksim stayed on the sand, following him. He thinks of moving here. Working at a restaurant. Buying a club and beating those fishermen one at a time, the others tied up and forced to watch. He smiles. He hops back toward the sand where the dog is waiting, wagging her tail. Otherwise, the beach is empty. Stars are now visible and the sunset water is thick and undulating. He feels the strange pull of it. He asks the dog, “What next?” He finds himself back at the restaurant. He steps onto the deck and peers in. The glass doors are locked, the lights off, and no one is inside. He sits on the steps facing the water and reaches inside his jacket pocket. He pulls out a pack of cigarettes that belonged to his uncle and smokes one. It helps his hunger. Then he realizes he has not fed the dog, has brought nothing for the dog. What a stupid thing to forget. He opens up his backpack as though food might magically appear. But by now, the dog has fallen asleep, and Maksim tucks his feet under her body to keep warm. He matches his breathing with the dog’s. His eyes begin to close; the ocean comes and moves over him. He jerks awake to someone lifting the brim of his baseball cap. The woman from the bar is leaning down. He has no idea what time it is—late enough that the water is lit by the night. He can see her there in the silver light. Then he wonders why the dog didn’t bark and turns. “Where’s my dog?” “No dog,” the woman says. “Did you find your boat?” He shakes his head. He searches around him for tracks in the sand. “You could try looking for a boat again in two days.” “Two days?” “Rain tomorrow. Fog. Not good to see the sights, yes?” “I’m not seeing the sights,” Maksim says, and gets up. Again, she considers him. “Come on,” she says. He says he needs to look for the dog, but she says, “The dog will come back.” She brings him inside the restaurant to the bar. She hands him a blanket and a glass of water and brings out a bowl for the dog, which she leaves outside. He asks if she has any food for the dog. She takes out a jar full of pretzels and peanuts. “That’s for you both,” she says. He twists open the gray lid and eats fistfuls of the snack. The salt wakes him. He drinks more water. She opens two beers and gives him one. He drinks it fast enough that it goes to his head. She sips hers and watches the television. Yeltsin is talking about Chechnya. She glances at him, presses mute, and switches the channel to a soccer game. “I’m Sofia,” she says. “Maksim.” “How old are you, Maksim?” He lies. “Eighteen. You?” She chuckles. She tells Maksim it was her husband’s restaurant, but doesn’t go on. “I wouldn’t mind working at a restaurant,” Maksim says. “You might,” Sofia says, and taps her fingernails against her beer. He walks to the deck, looking for the dog. For the first time, Sofia asks what he is doing here, and he explains. He takes out the money, too. Sofia counts the money, returns it to him, and then says, “I know someone with a boat.” “You didn’t say that earlier,” Maksim says. “I didn’t know you earlier,” Sofia says. He tries to give her the money again but she refuses. On the television, a goalie dives and catches the ball. Sofia tells him to get some sleep, that she will see him tomorrow, and she turns the lights off and steps out. Maksim lies down against the bar. The floor is sticky and smells of old beer. But a tiredness that is much greater than the trip today settles inside him. He concentrates on the ocean swell, thinking again of his uncle in the water. The dog does not come back the next day. Sofia arrives in the morning and brings him to an old, tiny fishing trawler on the dock. She says it is her nephew’s boat, and that she will take him herself. He hasn’t told her that he has never been on a boat before. A curtain of fog has settled on the coast. The air sticks to him. Soon, they are off, pushing away from land and heading east into the Sea of Japan, into a fog that grows denser the farther they go. He sits on the floor beside her, his knees to his chest and his eyes closed, waiting for the nausea that has hit him to pass. The trip takes hours. At first he keeps his eyes closed. Then he grows used to the rhythm of the boat and the engine noise, and as the nausea recedes, he stands, peering over Sofia’s shoulder. He cannot see the island, because of the fog. Then glimpses of it appear, and he spots the port and the tall green hills near the water. The port is busier than he thought it would be. He can see fishermen on the dock and a cargo ship a little farther down, everything vanishing and then reappearing in the fog. They find an empty space for her to dock quickly. She asks how long he needs. He hasn’t thought about that. But he feels a new energy as he picks up his backpack. His heart beats fast. “I can’t stay here,” she says. “So I’ll come back tomorrow at noon. And if you’re not here tomorrow, I’m calling the police. Deal?” He nods. He almost asks her to come. He jumps off and turns. “My dog,” Maksim says. “Yes,” Sofia says. “I’ll find the dog.” He tightens the straps of his backpack and hurries through the fog down the dock. Seabirds have flocked to the main street, eating crumbs in the middle of the road. Every time a car races out of the fog, the birds startle and scatter. Maksim takes a trail up a hill. He knows the prison isn’t far from the dock; he wants to reach high ground, above the fog. But the higher he goes, the less he can see. A wind gusts over him. Rounding a bend, he stumbles upon two men kneeling beside a boulder. One of them is placing something into a duffel bag. He retreats, unsure if they have noticed him, but the language they are speaking to each other catches his ear. He has never heard it before. Then he hears the men calling him over. In Russian, Maksim asks if they know where the prison is. “You turning yourself in?” The man closer to him grins. “My father,” Maksim says. “He’s a guard.” The man’s grin doesn’t break. He says the trail will end soon, at an intersection where three roads go three ways. “Take the far right,” he says. “It’ll get you there. But stay on the curb. People speed here.” Maksim thanks them. Before he goes, he asks what language they were speaking. Instead of answering, the man says, “You are Koryo Saram, yes?” Koryo Saram. Person of Korea. “Yes,” Maksim says. “We were here long before you, my friend.” The man keeps grinning. “So long,” he says. His companion lifts the duffel bag and they both take the trail down and vanish into the fog. Maksim finds the three roads, takes the far-right one. He keeps to the side as the man said, following an empty field that reminds him of the farm. Almost half an hour later, the prison appears: high walls, barbed wire, and a tower. By the main entrance stands a booth with a guard inside. When the guard notices him, Maksim says his father’s name. He says his father is also a guard and that he is looking for him and that it is important. He says if the guard doesn’t believe him, he should ask around. The guard puts down the magazine he has been reading and leans forward. “You’re Vasily’s boy?” Maksim nods. The man checks a clipboard and says Vasily’s shift hasn’t started yet. “He’s home,” the guard says. “Go there.” Maksim doesn’t know where that is. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. The guard hesitates, then says, “Walk back to the road. Take a right and keep walking until you reach a hill where a cluster of houses overlooks the prison. If it weren’t for the fog, you’d see the houses from here. You’re really Vasily’s boy?” Maksim doesn’t answer. He has been on the island now for over an hour. He pictures Sofia’s trawler well on its way back to the mainland. The more tired his legs grow, the more the fog is like an ocean and the land is floating on it. He reaches the houses. They are well built, with sturdy, new roofs—the kind he would like to live in one day. He wonders which one is his father’s when almost at once, Maksim spots him behind the window of the first one. Vasily then steps out the back, lights a cigarette, and turns toward the road. “Maksim!” They stand facing each other. Maksim’s eyes do not leave his father as Vasily sits on a bench beside a picnic table in the backyard, facing the prison below, though it is barely visible right now. Five years. All those days seem to collapse. He cannot remember a single one. Maksim sits across from him on the other bench. From here, he can see the back of the house, where a woman is staring at them through the doorway. She is wearing a bathrobe and when she steps out, his father tells her to go back inside. She doesn’t listen. She is Vasily’s age and has very long hair that she has washed and blow-dried. The cigarette smell around them mixes with the smell of her shampoo. She says, “That your boy?” but Vasily doesn’t respond. Maksim doesn’t either. He is looking at his father, who is clean-shaven for the first time he can recall and wearing a pressed shirt. “He doesn’t look like you at all,” the woman says. “He’s better looking than I am,” Vasily says. “That’s the truth.” “You staying for a bit?” his father says. The woman leans toward Vasily’s ear. “I don’t want no boy,” she says, and walks back inside, taking the shampoo smell with her. “You hungry? You want a beer?” his father says. Then he says, “How old are you now?” A wind pushes over them, bringing the fog, erasing his father for a moment. “It’s a nice house,” Maksim says. “It’s a good job. A steady one. Like I told you.” “You’ve lived here the whole time?” Vasily shakes his head: He used to live farther away in an apartment complex. The houses here were built by the new government. A lottery was set up for guards who were interested; he was one of the winners and moved here last year. Maksim pictures his father winning a house. He tries to think if they ever won anything. “That’s some luck,” Maksim says, and his father takes a drag of his cigarette, shutting one of his eyes so the smoke doesn’t go in. “I remember that hat,” Vasily says. Maksim takes off his uncle’s baseball cap and places it on the tabletop. “He knew nothing about baseball,” his father says. “He just liked the hat.” “He knew a little,” Maksim says. His father looks down as though he is recalling something and then asks how the house is, who is living there these days on that farm road, and Maksim considers how to answer. He wants to say there have been bad years at the farm. The corner store isn’t making enough money to hire him, and he can’t pay next month’s rent. He wants to say he isn’t sure he will be there anymore and is thinking of going somewhere else, except he doesn’t know where to go. “Did you get the letter?” Maksim says. “I did.” “You didn’t come to the funeral.” “I didn’t know if he would’ve wanted me there,” Vasily says. “I didn’t know if you would’ve, either.” Maksim breaks away from his stare, turns to the hillside. He points down below. “Was any of that the camp?” he says. “The what?” “The labor camp. Grandad.” His father doesn’t know. “Do you think of him?” Maksim says. “When you’re working in there? I would think of him all the time. If I was working there.” “Then I’m glad you aren’t working there,” Vasily says. After a pause, he softens his voice and says there’s too much going on inside the prison to think of much. “Do you know why Grandad ended up where he did?” Maksim says. “Why he stayed in this country?” “Yeah,” Vasily says. “He got on the wrong boat.” He can’t tell if his father is joking. Then his father laughs. Maksim is startled. He can’t remember the last time he heard his father laugh. It is like ash being thrown over a small fire inside him. “Do you remember a dog?” Maksim says. “At the farm?” “I’ve got no use for dogs,” his father says. “It’s a Rhodesian ridgeback. The breed came from Africa. The workers told me that. I caught a ride with them.” “What’s Africa got to do with me? Or you?” “I’d like to go to Africa,” Maksim says. Vasily stubs out his cigarette. “You came all this way to ask if I got your letter, to talk about your grandfather, and to tell me you’re going to Africa?” “No,” Maksim says. “I came to say two other things.” His father waits. Maksim’s throat tightens. He looks down and grips the edge of the tabletop. He says, “I don’t know if you were planning on coming back to check on me. But if you were, I don’t need you to.” “You don’t need me to, yeah?” his father says. “Yeah,” Maksim says. “I’m okay. I’m okay on my own.” His father reaches across and Maksim flinches. His father laughs some more and then, to Maksim’s surprise, he reaches across more carefully and takes Maksim’s hand. He takes his hand gently, as though they are praying together. Maksim fixes his gaze down at the fog slipping in under him. The way it floats there around his legs like something ancient and alien. “Do you use a club?” Maksim says. He says it quietly, but Vasily hears. “What?” “At the prison. Do you use a club?” He feels the pressure of his father’s hand against his own. He waits for the break in the silence, for his breath to be knocked away, for that sudden crack in the world, and it is like he wants it to happen. He doesn’t understand why he would want that. It is like the way the dog bounds across the barley fields into the woods, as though being drawn there by something the dog can’t control. But nothing happens. His father does nothing. He lets go of Maksim’s hand, and the wanting vanishes as quickly as it came. All of a sudden, the air fills with a foreign noise. A siren. An alarm. It fills this corner of the island. Maksim thinks perhaps it is an airplane, but then bright lights flicker down below at the prison. From inside the house the telephone rings, and the woman appears, waving the receiver. His father goes inside. He comes back out a few minutes later, buttoning up his uniform. “Someone broke out,” he says. “It’s all right. It’s nothing to worry about. It happens a few times a year.” Maksim watches as below a pickup truck comes out of the prison and approaches the house. “You know who it is?” Vasily says. “It’s always those Nivkhs. They break the law and get punished for it and they think they can just walk out. Because they think it’s their island and they can do whatever they want. We try, you know? We try to be good to them. We even hire some as guards. Then all they do is break one of their friends out.” Maksim has stopped listening to his father. He is thinking of the two men he ran into on the trail. The duffel bag. One of the men grinning at him. The cadence of their language. Nivkh. The truck pulls up out front. Maksim walks around with his father. Vasily goes on: “Do you know? All they ever do is go home. The world changes, it will always change, and they will always stay the same. Why do you think that is? Stubborn fools.” Before Maksim can say anything back, his father says: “Maksim, what was the second thing?” “The second thing?” “That you wanted to say to me,” his father says. “You said you came to say two things. What is the second thing?” Two guards with rifles are in the cab, staring at Maksim. “Is there anyone else?” Maksim says. “Anyone else?” “In our family,” Maksim says. “Is there anyone else, somewhere else?” “Hell if I know,” Vasily says, and jumps onto the bed of the pickup. The truck speeds away. The woman is by the front door, but Maksim ignores her. He feels a lingering heat where his father held his hand, focused there in his palm. He keeps feeling it as he passes the prison and gets back on the trail. At the port, he searches for Sofia’s trawler, in case she never left. Some fishermen are staring up at the hills, at the noise. It is then that he realizes he forgot his uncle’s baseball cap on the picnic table. For a moment, the air goes quiet. He sees nothing in the fog but panning light—the dog in the field, his uncle swimming. He reaches out. Then a car rushes by, swift and dark, almost touching him as the alarm continues to sound, louder now, across the island."

        "year": "2021",
        "story": "He had adopted this insane new beauty practice of rubbing Preparation H on the bags under his eyes. He was trying to scrub that puffy, confused, alcoholic look right off his face—it burned to all hell but goddamn if it didn’t work. There had to be some kind of fancy, faggy, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory something or other at a boutique in San Francisco that, like, smelled nice and blended into the skin in a less severe way. But these days he could barely make it to the corner store, much less downtown San Francisco. The trolley cars bothered him, the European tourists giving him that What are you doing here? look on the street bothered him, effort in general bothered him—put all these factors together and what was left was a tube of hemorrhoid cream purchased at the Grocery Outlet for $1.50. He still smelled like alcohol in the morning, but at least his face didn’t look all fucked-up. The small victory would have to do. The past couple of months he had started sleeping with his feet hanging out of his second-story window. It helped to correct his restless moving around in bed, and now he could hear the cars out on the highway in the night. He started to have dreams that he was peacefully underwater, but he knew his brain was reinterpreting the cars roaring past. From a distance, the hum of the highway sounded like waves crashing into land. In his bed, he would pull the covers over his head and imagine being in the ocean. Alone and at peace. The fall had been a hard stretch. He was an actor and had gotten a job that summer as the lead of this god-awful play, some drama about a murderer in a mining town during the Gold Rush. It bored him to tears and he hit the bottle real hard one night before the show, ended up blacking out onstage and being removed from the play the next day. It was not the first time this had happened. He relayed the story to his friend Mark over the phone. “I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of a bunch of prominent white neoliberals,” he offered. “Again?!” said Mark. “Again. The stage manager was this hippie who told me I would never work in this town again! I broke down and cried.” Real tears—he could feel them leaking through the film of the Preparation H. Mark kept his cool. “I mean, that’s nice of her to threaten you and all, but keep in mind you never really worked there before—who gives a flying fuck?! Meet me and the boys for lunch.” He and Mark were brothers of sorts. A decade and a half ago, the two of them had been cast in a TV show on a fledgling gay channel, about the lives of four single Black gay men in L.A. It was a big to-do—audiences loved it, and he basically played the Black version of all the white queens he hated. He had been working on some horrible avant-garde play in San Francisco when his agent called him with an offer for the part of Jonathan—muscular, 33, a nonurban Black hippie wallflower type. Easy enough. He had been having problems landing acting gigs that didn’t read as “urban”—every role called for a strong masculine Black man with confidence and all the answers, and he couldn’t fake that even for a paycheck. The role of Jonathan felt tailor-made—after all, he’d grown up in Encino. The show was so uniquely Black (or as “Black” as white West Hollywood tastes would allow) that no one noticed the characters for what they were: really shitty muscle queens from L.A. He hoped at first that they would mirror the Spice Girls and each have some form of distinct personhood (he wanted to be the dark-skinned “woke” one), but no such luck. Instead they were four leads who all mirrored one another like quadruplets; the running catchphrase of the show (said in unison) was “Ew! He’s fat!” (Cue laugh track.) He’d made semi-decent money from the sitcom for the price of his soul and done what all reasonable G-list “celebrities” did: stumbled into cocaine and alcohol addiction. The show was over before the third season and he kept on drinking. He moved back to San Francisco, broken as all hell, and chased jobs in regional theater. During harvest season, he worked on the pot farms up north. Mark had also moved to San Francisco recently—he was working as an agent now, developing talent. I hate the idea of meeting these faggots for lunch, he thought, getting ready to do just that. He despised Mark’s habit of always dragging boys he was fucking to brunch for an awkward meet and greet. Especially today. Still—it was time to go meet these faggots. Upon arriving, he quickly ordered an Irish Health—Jameson whiskey and green tea on ice with simple sugar (and a splash of Baileys, if you must). He slammed it and then ordered a double of the same, feeling better. Mark showed up with two queens he’d had sex with the night before. One boy was a blonde and the other had a birthmark on his face. Mark was dominating, as always. He had a way of taking a conversation and boiling it down to its essentials—his stories always led back to sex and/or violence. At this particular brunch he was explaining how he had recently been robbed south of Market Street. “I had on a thousand-dollar watch, had all my credit cards on me, $700 in cash I owed my roommate, and an extra-large cheese pizza I’d ordered from the place on the corner. So I see this big Black muscle queen walking toward me from 12th Street. Big ole uncut dick swinging to the gods in his track pants and I’m staring him down like, Wanna fuck? He rolls up on me and the last thing I remember is him punching me in the head. Anyway, I wake up about 30 minutes later, and I know it’s 30 minutes later ’cause I still had my watch on, plus my credit cards and the cash—the only thing missing was the pizza!” The boy with the birthmark spit up his Jack-and-soda. The blond boy asked me what I did. “I was an actor but I failed. Now I work in agriculture, seasonally,” I said, not looking him in the eye. “I’m in between trips.” “You mean you grow weed?” he pressed. “Yes.” They all got drunker and went to Mark’s. The other men got naked on the bed, but he felt apart, too drunk and sad to achieve an erection. There came a point when the merry trio was having sex on top of him and he rolled over and pulled the covers over his head. He wanted to be underwater again. This year, he took a new way to the farm. Just to be a troll, he’d signed up for one of those Christian free-ride groups, and it totally backfired. The Christian man he hitched a ride with was on his way to Oregon from Texas; he made it a point to pray every time they stopped to get gas or take a piss. At one prayer stop, the Holy Ghost lasted for 20 minutes and ended with the man going into full-on testimony. He sat in the passenger seat listening to the man and wished to God (ironically enough) that he could find a ride group where all he had to do was flash his dick and get to his destination in a timely manner. The car finally made its way to Lake County. The farm was near there. Supposedly Clear Lake was the largest lake in California, and supposedly it was the oldest lake in North America. He was told these things but never bothered to confirm them himself. The car navigated the two-lane highway that circled the lake for miles and miles. Post–World War II, the lake had been a popular Northern California tourist destination; he spied from the car window all the dilapidated fishing piers and run-down motor lodges with their decaying mid-century signs more or less intact. The lake itself was fishable, yet the catch was rarely edible. The mine nearby had closed in the ’50s, but not before polluting the entire body of water with mercury. It was poison. The car dropped him off at the gas station nearest to the farm and he waited for the farm owner to pick him up. It had once been owned by this dyke who then sold it to a Puerto Rican man from New Jersey. He watched the new owner pull up in a huge black pickup truck, introduced himself, and got in. The owner gave him the rundown—there were 92 outdoor plants tucked out past the valley that he would attend to and dry before the seasonal trimmers came in and manicured the buds. The new owner would fly out every two weeks and give him a ride to the general store to replenish his supplies: drinking water, gas for the generators, toilet paper, all that stuff. The owner gave him two guns to keep in case feds or thieves came lurking, and left him on the property to do his work. That was in late July, and he had now been on the mountain for a while. The exact number of days, he could not tell—time blurred so much up here. His task was repetitive, but he loved being alone. Just him, the plants, the drying room (the only built structure on the property), the hum of the gas generators, and his two guns. His job was to kill all the boys. Even the smallest amount of a male plant’s pollen can seed a whole crop, and pot with seeds is unsellable. Some girl plants could change sex, “dropping balls” (seed sacks) and getting all the other girls pregnant. So he had to kill and dispose of all the new boys too. Years earlier, he had worked at several random farms and trimmed for strangers, but it hadn’t lasted long. Being stuck three hours from nowhere in the California backwoods with white hippies was a particular form of hell; they all smelled bad and had Ganesh tattoos. They insisted that he “think positively.” He hated that shit. He had scored the right gig eventually, with this small private farm that he worked alone until the fall trimmers came to finish up. A fussy creek cut through the hills, and he bathed in it in the mornings, the icy coldness of it stinging his balls. No soap could be used, for fear of polluting the river. His drinking water and all his other supplies were kept in a slender kitchen with a separate entrance on the back side of the drying room. He had to shit in a hole in the ground. The goal was to get all the weed cut and dried before the rainy season arrived in winter. Two years before, the rain had started early and mold had grown on all the plants, which didn’t begin to cover how damn miserable he had been in the tent he had pitched. He made a pallet to sleep on in the drying room this time around. At night, when he was alone in the drying shed, the landscape outside had the dark glow of moonlight. The moon put a soul filter on everything. The hum of the gas-powered generator reminded him of the underwater sound of the highway cars he could hear from his bedroom in the city. He felt like a nature god, alone in the great expanse. If he really thought about it, he had never wanted to be an actor. Not really. In his memory, it had happened upon him. On a whim, he had stormed the stage when he was 5: a one-man coup. His older cousin was 8 or 9 at the time, participating in her elementary-school beauty pageant, and he was sitting in his Sunday church suit in the audience in the school gymnasium, next to his auntie. He saw all the girls in delicate dresses, lit up onstage, and noticed the applause every time they twirled about. When one contestant departed the stage, he saw it empty and knew he should be there. He sneaked from under his auntie and ran up the side steps and placed his little body midstage. He couldn’t see the faces of the audience (perhaps an early indicator of his nearsightedness). Then came the roar of applause. He knew he had done something right because everyone was clapping for him. As soon as the shock wore off, his little face grinned—just in time for his auntie to come rip him off the stage by his hand. “Boy, you know you know betta!” she whisper-yelled in his ear as she led him down the steps. He couldn’t even hear her. The smile on his face lasted for days. All he’d ever wanted, he realized, was the stage lights and the applause; the acting itself was just the driver holding the carrot in front of the donkey. He figured that if society had allowed a butcher, a baker, or a candlestick maker to merit stage lights and applause, he would have easily been any one of those, too. His mother had always hated his profession; she thought it was too common. She barely even congratulated him when he got on a network show. She wanted him to be a teacher, and she eventually got her wish. He’d spent a few years teaching acting workshops at regional theaters after the TV show was canceled—there were a great many people who couldn’t act. He marveled at how all reluctant thespians shared the same complaint: “I don’t like being watched.” The statement was a cop-out. He usually cured the novice actor with one sentence. “You’re not afraid of being watched—you’re afraid of watching yourself be watched.” The student would invariably look confused, and more often than not, a series of breakthroughs ensued. In his mind, spewing words was the easy part; the work of blocking out motions was the challenge that killed or illuminated an expression, the business of what to do with the hands or feet while trying to convince an audience that you are someone else. Movement is always the purest indication of how truthful one is being. He had never been a good actor, just a committed one—committed like Robert Downey Jr. or Mel Gibson, to being a caricature of himself. In fact, acting had given him license to be himself. The context, mannerisms, or historical backdrop could change from play to play, but he stayed wrapped up in his typecast: a fragile yet strong (or faux brave) and always spiraling man. In acting he attempted to put distance between himself and the audience. It was like that first night he stepped onstage when he was 5. As far as he was concerned, there was only the holy trinity of him, the stage lights, and the void. A perfect freedom. It would not be forever. He began to notice it—small at first, but then it grew, the thing he’d warned others against but slowly failed to reconcile in himself: He noticed himself being watched. It was the beginning of the end; the death was sudden. One day, out of fucking nowhere and without warning, the audience all had faces, eyes, and expectations. After the television show had been canceled, and after he’d gotten bored teaching workshops, he had retreated to the tepid world of Northern California live theater, all bit parts with no infrastructure for advancement. His artistic fatigue began with two celebratory shots before each stage performance, then four, then half the bottle. Before long he had been fired, for the first of many times, because he reeked of alcohol onstage. His fatigue culminated in the night he blacked out onstage for the last of his many times. After that, he’d quit booze for a bit and even went to AA—it seemed like a start, until he descended again. The next time was harder. The second and third time you fail is always worse; there’s the voice that asks, Am I really choosing to be this person? The realization felt like death, or like being underwater, but not in a peaceful way. Now, up north and safe after his last onstage meltdown, he stood in the general store in town looking at a bottle of whiskey for a good four minutes. He had gone out to refill the surplus gas containers for the farm’s generators. He felt an intense craving but knew he’d be on the mountain by himself. Fearing the hell he might conjure, he decided to be cautious. Whiskey was his shaman drug of choice, and he knew to avoid the spirit. He left the medicine aisle and got some dried jerky and water instead. He paid the cashier and left. He bought an extra blanket too, just in case. It was almost October and he had another month and a half on the mountain. It would start to turn cold soon. By 7 a.m. it was warm, and in a few hours it would be too hot to work. He quickly began counting the marijuana plants, preparing some for a wet trim, taking others to the drying room. He worked until his midday break, when he sat under a tree and scraped the dirt and THC crystals from his fingertips—“finger hash,” as they called it. He would smoke it later. In his youth, he believed a lot of dumb shit, like that one time an older fag in a bar had relayed to him the origin of “Spanish hash.” “So in Spain they send young boys running naked through the marijuana fields and then they scrape the THC from their bodies. That’s why Spanish hash is so expensive!” This myth was soon debunked by a fellow weed trimmer. “Naw, brother,” said Austin, this California hippie boy he sat next to in the trim room. “No naked boys. They make that shit from explosives. Butane.” As the midday heat faded, he was back in the garden, making sure the plants hadn’t swapped sexes. He started to separate the good pot that would be trimmed and sold as flower from the lesser grade that would be consolidated and turned into hash. Soon the chores were done and he sat drinking water under the shade of another tree. His mind always doubled down on itself at this point in the day. Whenever catching a moment’s breath, he had the same thought: Where had he gone? The last thing he remembered before the blackout was forgetting all of his lines. He was told later that he hadn’t resorted to curse words or jittery, unexpected behavior. Rather, it had been a cool and complete dissociation onstage. He’d gone to a table upstage right and buried his face in his hands for a full 15 minutes. The 49 people in the audience got frustrated and eventually walked out. His onstage retirement party. Mid-November, when the harvest was over, meant it was time to return to the city to pay the rent and nestle in for the wet, rainy winter ahead. He sat at the bus stop waiting for his Greyhound to arrive. He decided the bus trip would be nice and didn’t want to risk getting another religious fanatic as a driver. It began raining so he wrapped himself in a poncho and covered his gear in plastic. The line for the bus was long, and the unfortunate farmhands who had not shown up early enough to stand inside the shoddy bus-stop shelter were all getting soaked. On the ground near the little bench inside the shelter, he noticed a full ziplock bag of weed. Someone had dropped it or left it behind, but he didn’t even blink. He hated marijuana at this point. The bus rolled up and all the wet, weary farmers boarded. Looking out the window, he was taken aback as always by the beautiful landscape of the area, and by the cultural disconnect of the California backwoods. It somehow remained redneck as all hell—he even occasionally saw Confederate flags on bumper stickers. He remembered that a few hours outside any city in America, it was business as usual. Later rather than sooner, he arrived in Oakland. He wanted no more of the bus and got off and called a car to take him to S.F. His apartment was as he’d left it: sparsely furnished and clean. His life as a farmer had made him want to be a nomad, and every time he came back from the mountain he got rid of more and more stuff. If only it were possible to be a part-time resident in everything. For the first time in forever, he felt that strange and foreign emotion—a stillness and a sense of peace. He began to cry. He showered, put on warm sweats, turned on the heater, and boiled water for tea. He finally listened to the voicemails on his phone that he’d ignored while on the mountain. Mostly the usual: one from Mark saying he was no longer hanging out with the blonde or the kid with the birthmark; others from bill collectors, student-loan officers, his mother (over and over and over again)—and one of note. “Hello, this is Shelia Waters from the Stein Agency in Los Angeles. This message is for Antonio Johnson. We have an offer for you—the role of Jonathan is being revamped for an upcoming movie project based on Missed Connections. We hope this is still your number! We have a very handsome offer! You can reach me at 310-555-7762, extension 312. Hope to talk soon!” He had all but stopped breathing. The news hit him in the gut, hard. Why was the show making a comeback? It seemed like an idea he should entertain, certainly. He felt the butterflies in his stomach as he did. He paced for a bit, and thought about starting a new gym routine, a new diet; going back to his acting coach; finding a place in L.A. to stay while filming. Then the kettle began to whistle, pulling him back into his mind and his apartment. He poured the boiling water on the peppermint-tea bag in the cup and brought it to his bed. He sat down and, even though it was raining, rolled his sweats up to his knees and placed his feet out the window. As quickly as it had rushed through him, his excitement fled. He was at peace as the cars sped by on the highway again. He heard waves. This story has been excerpted from Brontez Purnell’s forthcoming novel-in-stories, 100 Boyfriends."

        "story": "Consensus was the world was ending, or would begin to end soon, if not by exponential environmental catastrophe then by some combination of nuclear war, the American two-party system, patriarchy, white supremacy, gentrification, globalization, data breaches, and social media. People looked sad on the subway, in the bars; decisions were questioned, opinions rearranged. The same grave epiphany was dragged around everywhere: We were transitioning from an only retrospectively easy past to an inarguably more difficult future; we were, it could no longer be denied, unstoppably bad. Although the death of any hope for humanity had surely been decades in the making, the result of many intersecting systems described forbiddingly well, it was only that short period—between the election of a new president and his holding up a hand to swear to serve the people—that made clear what had happened, and showed that we were too late. I didn’t believe all this necessarily, though as the news got worse and more bizarre, I wavered. I’ve always been drawn to pragmatism, just not exactly a natural at it; as my brain says Calm down, my heart says, also weirdly calmly, A paradoxical comfort can be found in drama. My official position, if you were to ask me at a party or something, is that the popular turn to fatalism could be attributed to self-aggrandizement and an ignorance of history, history being characterized by the population’s quickness to declare apocalypse imminent despite its permanently delayed arrival. We don’t want to die, but we also don’t want to do anything challenging, such as what living requires, so the volubility with which certain doom was discussed made a tedious kind of sense. The end of the world would let us have our cake and eat it, too; we would have no choice but to die, our potential conveniently unrealizable due to our collapse. Until such time, the idea that everything was totally pointless now was seductive, particularly as a mantra you could take advantage of when it suited you and abandon when life started to feel alarming. I myself was soon using it to indulge some of my naughtier impulses, by which I mean that in the first hours of a morning in early January, when the sky was still dark and the government still hurtling, I decided to snoop through my boyfriend’s phone while he was asleep. I’d never really had the urge to go through another person’s things before. After a few disappointing experiences with high-school boyfriends’ instant-message histories, I’d learned that poking around the by-products of other people’s thoughts usually yielded the mundane, the predictable, and the unattractive. Even with men I respected intellectually, I never found myself caring enough to breach their trust; before Felix, my boyfriends exuded the wholesome, loving, deep-down reliability of hot dads on television shows, despite being, as far as I knew, not hot, nor dads, nor on television. Simply put: Before Felix, I had good taste. (With the exception of a water-polo player I once showered with in college, a handful of celebrities, and anyone else I may find myself dazzled by in the future, I avoid obvious physical attractiveness because I believe it presages suffering.) But over the year and a half we’d been together, Felix had revealed himself to be completely unrevealing, insisting over and over as I baited and nagged and implored him to tell me his innermost hopes, fears, and childhood-formed biases either that there was nothing to tell or, conflictingly, that he’d told me everything already and it wasn’t his fault if I didn’t remember. It was humiliating, and I assumed he was hiding something, probably other women. He almost always slept with his cellphone under his pillow. At first I’d thought this was arbitrary, or that it was related to some concern about emergencies transpiring in the night or a previous lack of nightstand, but after he started acting different—not strange, but different—I became certain he did it because he feared I would read his emails and text messages. That his bedtime cellphone habit predated his transformation from funny, somewhat reserved guy to slightly less funny, somewhat more reserved guy didn’t matter: Regardless of motive, sleeping with your phone under your pillow is weird, and I’d failed to think about that until his subtle shift in comportment cast a new light on everything he did. There wasn’t much to go on, but that didn’t matter either. Sometimes, lately, when we were texting each other, little ellipses would appear in the chat to indicate that Felix was typing to me for an extended period of time, perhaps an entire minute, but then the message would never arrive. He would type whatever it was and delete it, and instead of sending something less delicate or elaborate in its place, he would just stop texting me, as if we were fighting. This seems like a relatively small thing until it happens to you 12 or 13 times. His numerical password was long, and random as far as I could tell, and I was able to decipher it only after weeks of surreptitiously watching him tap it out. He frequently bragged about not being addicted to his phone, so this took longer than it might have otherwise, especially because we didn’t see each other as often as I gathered other couples of our status did (once a week when it should have been at least twice). I was resentful—my sense that I was being wronged was more powerful than my growing ambivalence about the relationship, which was partly related to the distance he’d created between us, but not entirely—so the snooping was also about revenge. I considered trying to place his thumb on the circular fingerprint sensor (which is, as I write this, already becoming obsolete, replaced by facial recognition, which is of course even worse) while he was asleep, but I’m not a reckless person—my risks are calculated, my dishonesty dignified. Serendipity arrived on the wings of the Grey Goose. Felix and I had gotten a little drunk at a bar down the street from my apartment, and he came over afterward. “I’m tired; I’m tired; I’m very, very tired,” he sang on the way home. “I’m not even going to brush my teeth!” Such goofiness was uncharacteristic; it put me on edge. When I’d nod my head along with the music in a café or perform some impromptu joy, he’d often look distraught or even ask me, glancing around as if truly uncomfortable, to stop. He did brush his teeth, in the end, and then proceeded to my bedroom, humming the “I’m tired” song and doing a cute, contained dance. Where was this coming from? I felt I was being manipulated, but I couldn’t say how. On my way to the bathroom, I saw that he’d left his phone on the bookshelf, where it lay all-knowingly next to his keys, wallet, and a stray stick of gum. I felt a nervous jolt; in the bathroom mirror my face was flushed. My skin-care regimen is more extensive than I’m proud of. I’d recently learned the importance of letting each product “fully” absorb before applying the next, and while I did not spend 45 minutes each night sitting in the bathroom awaiting transcendence, the layering approach I couldn’t completely abandon left me plenty of time to consider my options. After a swipe of special water supposedly popular in France I thought, I won’t do it. After I cleansed a second time, with a cleanser beloved in Korea, I was pretty sure I wouldn’t. After I used a scientific-looking dropper to apply serum to my nose to decrease redness and “purify” I thought, Great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment. After a pat of stinging, expensive foam, the effects of which were unconvincing, I thought, Ha, that’s funny. By the stroke of moisturizer, I was dewy and resolved: I had nothing to lose but my chains. Immediately I began to worry that my chance had slipped away—that, though Felix was not on social media through which he could mindlessly scroll in the dark before bed, he might have been overcome with an urge to check tomorrow’s weather or his email or the definition of a word (I don’t know what people without social media use their phones for) and retrieved the phone from the shelf. No. Still there. When I got to the bedroom, quietly passing my roommate’s door, he was breathing evenly, his blocky elbow jutting onto my side of the bed. I took off my glasses, got under the blanket, and lay on my back with my arms uncomfortably close to my body to avoid his aggressive joint. Felix shifted. I stared into the darkness and waited, the possessed radiator occasionally scaring me with a shaming clang. I dozed and woke, dozed and woke, until the familiar font said 03:12 and I was tapping out his passcode as if in a trance. (Bedroom door: I closed it slowly to avoid any creaking and did not let the latch click). Hunched forward on the couch, elbows on knees, the glow of it around me, I noted that it had opened to the home screen, so I should make sure to return to the home screen before going back to bed. At first there was too much information to take anything in; I felt frantic, like I had just entered a Walmart with the whimsical idea that I might get some socks, maybe a magazine, maybe a new kind of frozen burrito, and instead was confronted by the overwhelming vagueness of my desires. I looked to my bedroom door, trusting that I would hear him if he got up. I was so nervous that, though I do not believe bad people exist (with the exception of the water-polo player I once showered with in college and a handful of celebrities), I felt a strain—the sense that I must be a bad person, to be willing to feel so awful in order to commit the pretty minor offense I was committing. I suppose my definition of a bad person might be more self-centered than others’, though, really, worrying about being a bad person is entirely self-centered. Good people do not think in such categorical terms. It was a normal iPhone, with the pleasantly rounded corners whose design had recently been at the center of a (punted) Supreme Court ruling. Lined up according to his inscrutable personal preferences were the little square icons, also with pleasantly rounded corners, each featuring a nice illustration that someone had been paid a lot of money to develop. All were different colors yet of equal brightness, and the effect was to prevent the eye from focusing without exactly exhausting it either, making you feel that you were seeing too much and nothing at all. The manual camera, the color wheel, the maps, the better version of maps, the clock that displayed a real ticking digital timepiece, two ways to call a car, the weather partly cloudy yet always bright blue, the internet browser that was a compass but also a safari. His battery was half charged; he was automatically connected to the internet in my apartment. I tapped the messages icon and it opened to his conversation with me, trying to arrange a time and place to meet. Seeing our conversation in reverse, the one in which I remembered participating hours before, was jarring. The flair I thought I’d infused into my punctuation was gone; I was identifiable only by the facts of the exchange—my suggestion to Felix that we meet at 8:30 at the dark bar with the fireplace so I would have time to get a slice of pizza beforehand. My name at the top of the message history did not seem like my name; whatever I’d said or not said was no different from what anyone else might have. The rest of his conversations were unremarkable. Over the past few days, Felix had texted his mother, a co-worker, a friend I hated, his building superintendent, and a pair of artists he kept up a group chat with. There were girls I knew broadly; their exchanges wilted attempts at flirting, consisting of inert hahas and cools. I tapped back to our conversation so that it would show up first when he opened the messaging app, as before, and then returned, less nervous and less excited, to the home screen. I went to his email to search for his ex-girlfriend’s name and look through the Sent and Trash folders. I was about to abandon the project, disappointed at how boring he was and now very tired, when I saw the single icon containing images of tinier icons, situated in the bottom right-hand corner of his screen, labeled no. The little box expanded into a bigger box containing two messaging apps I’d never heard of and a social-media app on which I’d been led to believe Felix maintained no account. He’d deleted them soon after we got together, he’d said, in a display of resolve that impressed me at the time, even though he’d never been particularly obsessive about the internet. I hadn’t understood why he was bothering. I thought of the obvious things he’d want to hide: expressions of yearning, photos cut off at the neck or the belly button, meetups arranged in areas of the city I’d never known him to visit. I could imagine him fucking stupid women, young women, women he could easily leave behind, and assumed he was pursuing them here, possibly even with a pseudonym. I smiled in the glow of the phone, disturbed by the instant onset of joy. I tapped one of the icons, Instagram, and its familiar layout filled the screen. A row of circular user photos along the top indicated accounts that had posted Stories, photos and videos that would disappear in 24 hours, images that I thought, out of an abundance of caution, I shouldn’t view; if I looked, they would later reappear at the end of the row without an ombré ring around them, suggesting they had already been viewed. A new-message tab read 68. Beneath these was his feed, populated by people he followed. Because Instagram was not for reading, my instinct was always to skip over words—captions, usernames, tallies of likes, and comments—but as I scrolled down, careful not to tap twice and add Felix’s heart to someone’s post, I found that all the accounts he followed posted images that were dark, fuzzy, and uncultivated, or else they were crude cartoons, their meaning unclear and their purpose more so. When I ran into a notice from the app—“You’re all caught up! You’ve seen all new posts from the last two days”—I didn’t experience the shame I felt whenever I received the message in my own feed. Instead, I was surprised: Felix must have looked at Instagram all the time. At the bottom of the screen was a row of understated line drawings, a house, a magnifying glass, a plus sign, a heart. The rudimentary silhouette of a figure took me to his profile, where I realized I would need to consult the text. The topics there ranged from science to politics to business to national security, and were illustrated by images heavy-handed and amateur: doctored group photos of Barack Obama with George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jacob Rothschild, one of their arms stuck out at an unnatural angle to point a gun at the viewer; frowning women next to cellphones emitting harmful energies; the blurry Twin Towers in the moments before and after they were struck—all inscribed with warnings in large, artless fonts. The government at fault somehow. The Jews at fault somehow. Incredible, unbelievable facts. I noted the username, tapped out of the app, swiped the app out of the phone’s open queue, locked the phone using the button on its side—luckily the sound was off—and placed the device back on the bookshelf at precisely the nonchalant angle at which I’d found it. I was overtaken by a sense of purpose unlike anything I could re-create in a workplace. My boyfriend was a conspiracy theorist. I could have laughed, but I would have woken him up. Searching @THIS_ACCOUNT_IS_BUGGED_ from my own phone, I got a sense of how popular he was: tens of thousands of followers, hundreds of comments on each post, immense gratitude for his being one of the rare few to not only admit the truth but also strive to expose it for others. Instead of outrage or betrayal, I felt suddenly, magically free. Yes—I definitely wanted the relationship to end. I didn’t want things with Felix to be significantly different, as in better, than they had been for some time, or for the uneasy not-niceness of our relationship to transform into copacetic peace; I wanted riddance and finality, a cessation of concern. I may have hoped, gruesomely, that he had been cheating on me, but this was more conclusive: That he was operating a popular Instagram account promoting (and maybe devising) conspiracy theories meant he was no mere betrayer of trust or casual manipulator, but rather a person of impossible complexity whose motivations I was now liberated from untangling. He might make sense, by some twisted logic, but I would not be the one to determine how. Felix wasn’t a wayward soul down on his luck, uneducated and left behind, who had turned to conspiracy as a way to explain his pain; he did not believe the world was governed by a small group of highly influential Zionist conspirators, or that ambient Wi-Fi eroded cells that affect sleep and cognitive functioning and immune response. He did not believe that the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, were carried out by covert U.S.-government missions aimed at justifying the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. I knew these things about Felix as well as I knew anything about Felix, which in retrospect I suppose was not that well. Nevertheless, I’m pretty sure he was Jewish, so for him to be genuinely propagating anti-Semitic conspiracies would have been strange—possible, but strange. He was annoyingly logical, always asking for sources and proof, even when shooting the shit over drinks in the early hours of the morning. BUGGED was also not a word true internet conspiracy theorists used—it was a knowing appropriation of the past, a wink, a clue. One of his photos, posted 19 weeks earlier, was a triptych zooming in on a fuzzy form latched onto the side of an ashy World Trade Center building that, in each of the three images, became hazier; in the last photo the indistinct thing was circled and exposed as a DEMOLITION SQUID. An inside joke masquerading as a typo. He usually slept with his cellphone, as you know, under his pillow. Many options appealed: I could stomp into the bedroom and throw him out, with or without explanation. I could get back on his phone and cause mischief, through the account itself or through his email, text messages, etc. I could do nothing except begin to insert provocative phrasing into our conversations, suggesting but never confirming that I knew something he didn’t want me to know. Or I could procrastinate—put off leaving him until I could approach the endeavor with the calm dignity befitting the partner of a person who needs help. I don’t think I cared whether he got help, really; this was the final straw in a relationship that had always been porous and insecure, and I wanted to enjoy my righteousness, a secret of my own, and one that was far more original than “When I say ‘I love you’ I no longer mean it.” I imagined the satisfaction of saying, “I went through your phone and discovered you were operating a popular conspiracy-theory account on Instagram, and I just wanted to know … why?” But I wasn’t sure that was the absolute best way to play my hand, and I wanted to play my hand in the absolute best way. I had dumped my last boyfriend cruelly, clumsily, and nakedly (literally), blurting out that I had something to tell him as he wiped semen off my stomach with his underwear. I wanted there to be no question this time of any mishandling or callousness on my part; this was my chance to be purely and entirely the good one. I checked my Twitter account and decided to wait. Maybe you find it damning that I would go back to bed with someone who could do such a thing, that I would not be repulsed enough to immediately purge him from my house and my life. If he were spreading misinformation in a more usual, deceitfully earnest way—in an editorial published online, say—he would be condemned, and anyone who didn’t condemn him would be questioned, if not condemned themselves. The more ethical alternative—engaging the to-be-condemned person in a frank conversation about his behavior and motives—was also unappealing to me. This was a time when I was feeling nihilistic and base. That said, I understand that the reasoning I provided above isn’t quite good enough. I don’t know why I put the phone back, opened the door slowly so as not to wake him, lay down on my side of the bed, and pretended to forget everything I’d seen. I didn’t have trouble falling asleep. The next day I woke up calm. Now I occasionally fantasize about what might have happened if I’d raged into the bedroom, shaken him awake—he hated being startled during sleep, always acting as if he were personally offended by sudden noises—and demanded he tell me what the fuck was going on. In the fantasies, whatever he has to say for himself—half-asleep, worried, mad—doesn’t suffice, and, holding his phone in my hand like a love letter from a secret girlfriend, I kick him out into the night. Sometimes in the fantasies I throw the phone down the stairs after him; other times I just keep it. I believe the latter would be a more empowering outcome. Or maybe I’m being misleading. Maybe I had lingering feelings of tenderness toward Felix that I’d like in retrospect to obscure, given what my association with him must say about me, and I’d rather say I was strategizing than admit I was conflicted about what to do. I’m sure that’s true, though it doesn’t feel true. And I’m sure some of you might say strategy is immoral. Regardless, a few days later, we went on what would end up being our last date, to a restaurant on the Lower East Side popular among people in the art world, and the serenity of my upper hand turned me into a gracious interlocutor. Everyone was going to Japan right now, I agreed, looking over the menu. That was too bad, I added, because it meant that now you couldn’t go there without looking like a trend-following dabbler, and I also wanted to go. Felix had a thick beard, trimmed neatly, that he pulled at with one of his meaty hands as he spoke, claiming to prefer South America, which to him was “grittier.” Mmm, I said, in agreement, though I hated grit and objected to the appropriation of it. The music was ambient; the plants were bountiful; the menu was a mix of Spanish, Italian, and French influences; and though the cocktails were egregious, the wine was reasonably priced. I still recommend this restaurant to people; I harbor no complicated feelings about this restaurant. Soon after we sat down, Felix told the waiter, a smooth and beautiful gay man, that we were there to celebrate my acceptance to a Ph.D. program; when he heard where I would be studying, he raised his eyebrows and congratulated me. Felix smiled. This is another reason I knew Felix wasn’t, at his core, a paranoid misspeller known on the internet as @THIS_ACCOUNT_ IS_BUGGED_: I had not been accepted to any Ph.D. program, much less one at Harvard, but Felix liked to tell strangers inconsequential lies and build slightly alternate realities out of them, a game with no objective beyond his own delight. We had once been in on it together, or at least I’d thought so, and it had felt good-natured and fun, but now it just seemed like a way to assert intellectual authority over un- and never-to-be-witting strangers. Would I have even found out about a Ph.D. acceptance in early January? The timeline seemed ill-considered, though I had no idea. I practiced being alone by flirting with the waiter, whose name I learned was Dean, about burrata, such a great cheese. Felix one-upped me by saying we would have champagne, “to celebrate the genius.” When Dean whisked back with the bottle, I downed the bubbly dramatically, as soon as he poured my glass, the kind of social display I knew Felix hated, and smiled a smile I imagined imbued with smug superiority. Dean, shaking his head as if we were old friends and I were simply always adorably like this, declared me “an inspiration!” He refilled my glass as I wiped some liquid from the sides of my mouth. Later he brought us dessert on the house and Felix did not eat any of it. This story has been excerpted from Lauren Oyler’s forthcoming novel, Fake Accounts."

        "year": "2021",
        "story": "The man who lived upstairs had died, and it had taken the other tenants days to notice, days in which the sweetly putrid scent thickened and residents tried to avoid his part of the hall, palms tenting their noses as they came and left. At last someone sent for the building manager, who summoned his unemployed cousin to break the lock and paid him 100 yuan to carry the body down the three flights of stairs. There was a squabble as the residents who inhabited the adjoining rooms argued that they should have their rent lowered; the death was bad luck. Xiaolei stood listening as the building manager shouted them down. She felt sorry for the man who had died, whom she recalled as middle-aged, with tired, deep-set eyes, a chain-smoker who’d worked at the local post office. She supposed that if she ever asphyxiated or was stabbed overnight, the same thing would happen to her. That evening, she brought back a white chrysanthemum and went upstairs in the dark, intending to leave it outside his room. As she carefully mounted the steps, though, she saw that the door stood open. The room was windowless, with a blackness even denser than that of the hall. She didn’t wait for her eyes to adjust. She pitched the flower into the void, barely breathing, and ran back down the stairs. If she came to the store more often, Yongjie would have noticed in a flash that the flower was gone; she had the sharp female eyes of a southerner. But most days she wasn’t around; in addition to the flower shop, she ran her uncle’s poultry slaughterhouse, which occupied most of her time. Since she’d been at the job, Xiaolei probably could have gotten away with taking whole sheaves of flowers: high-waisted, frilly-leaved stems of alstroemeria, clusters of lilac batons. She thought they looked better in isolation, though, and kept her windowsill lined with individually pilfered stems, each housed in its own soda bottle: a tousle-headed rose, a single agapanthus in electric blue. It had been three years since she’d said goodbye to her parents, telling them that she’d gotten a job at a microchip factory down south in Shanghai. Plenty of girls had already left their village; no one expected them to farm anymore. As it happened, she didn’t know what a microchip was, but she’d heard a segment about them on the radio. She was 16 and took a teenager’s cruel pride in telling her parents about the microchips—a Japanese company, she’d said authoritatively, that made exports for Europe—and they’d been impressed enough to let her go. All the way up until she boarded the train, she’d been expecting them to catch her in the lie. When they hadn’t, she felt disappointed and unexpectedly sad, boarding a train to a city 14 hours south where she knew no one and had only a phony job waiting. The next morning, when she got to the flower shop, she was in a foul temper. She had not brushed her hair, and her reflection in the mirror behind the counter made her wince. It seemed that days of fighting to board buses, hustling for space on the sidewalk—elbows always out, eyes half-squinted to see if someone was cheating her, lips pursed and ready to answer back—had left an indelible mark. She was not yet 20 but felt the years deep beneath her skin, as though Shanghai had grafted steel plates in her cheeks. Already she’d lost a teenager’s mobility of features, sensed the exhausted cast of her eyes. Everyone she met had a story about someone from back home who’d made it big in Shanghai. Funny how she’d never actually met any of those people firsthand. Still, she thought the flower shop had helped. In her first job, working at the bottling plant, she’d felt herself turning into something nearly savage, fingers stiff, mind numb, chest a cage. There had been cats in her village who’d hiss and spit at anyone who came near them, and Xiaolei thought she could understand why. Sometimes if she wanted to leave her room, she first found herself listening for any hall noises and waiting until they subsided before exiting; the sound of another door rasping open would prompt her to pause. If she spotted people her age clustered in the courtyard—a few girls had made friendly overtures—she would turn and make a hasty retreat, as if suddenly remembering something. It wasn’t surprising, she told herself: All wild animals fear human contact. But for six months now, she’d stripped rose thorns and sold bouquets, and there was a civility to it. She’d found an aperture onto a part of Shanghai that she’d almost stopped hoping she’d ever see, which soothed some of the growling in her chest. She sold flowers to office secretaries and grieving widows who arrived in sleek black cars and men who dispatched identical bouquets to separate addresses, their wives and their mistresses. She learned to flatten her tones and inflect her voice with a certain inquisitive softness that wasn’t native to any one place, certainly not Shanghai, and customers seemed to appreciate it. Her moods were all over the place these days, low currents that eddied peaceably before surging up into the sand, erasing everything in their path. Maybe someday she would open her own flower shop. Skyscrapers were rising everywhere across the city, a neon tangle of signs and burnished steel, men in suits and women in high heels, click click clack. She could sell potted plants for their hallways, build up her own business, maybe meet someone in the elevator, get an office job. It wasn’t impossible. By lunch she had stopped thinking about the dead man and her spirits began to lift. Outside, the sunlight reflected off the white strips of the crosswalk, and the street almost glowed. She’d sold six bunches of daisies that morning and taken an order for a funeral spray of chrysanthemums. Yongjie would be pleased. It was Wednesday, so she’d been saving the best flowers all day for her favorite customer, first selling the ones with edges threatening to turn brown, the petals starting to swoon and go loose at the tips—another two days and they’d come undone. By 5 o’clock he still hadn’t arrived, though, and she felt a creeping sadness clot her limbs. As she helped other customers, she kept one eye out the door for his silhouette. The light outside was turning that pallid gray of late afternoon, stealing across the sidewalk, muting even the garish red sign across the way that blared health products, adult products; the jumble of computer cords and pipe fittings in the store next door; and beyond that, the dirty, slovenly floors of a small restaurant named for its chief menu item, Duck Blood Noodle Soup. He wasn’t in sight. She stared at the remaining flowers, fought the urge to tip them from their buckets onto the sidewalk. The day after next was Friday, meaning that she’d have to wake up at 3 a.m. to try to beat all the other flower vendors to the wholesale market across town, then spend the next few hours slopping heavy, wet bundles back to the store. It also meant that she now had to go wash out the buckets, already rancid with rotting stems, before leaving for the night. The scent of dying stock flowers, their stems soft and mushy in the water, she thought, compared almost unfavorably to the smell of her neighbor’s corpse. And then, suddenly, the man was outside the store and smiling at her with his crinkled-up eyes. He ducked through the door as if dodging inclement weather, though it wasn’t raining, and he rolled his shoulders backwards, relaxing them. He’d cut his hair, she noticed, and was wearing the same white collared shirt as always; she envisioned his closet lined with whole glowing rows of them. At the sight of him, she felt the room come into focus again; her face unfroze. “Seven red roses and three lilies?” she asked, not quite able to meet his eyes, and he nodded. “The nice wrapping, please.” She felt a warm thrum in her chest. The ease he carried with him worked on her like a balm, though he rarely said much—indeed, now that she’d memorized his order, there was scarcely any need to speak at all. She stepped toward the buckets with their floral charges, grateful now for their perked-up appearance, and tucked her hair behind her ears. Gently, she pulled each flower from its bucket and started splaying them out in her left hand, a galaxy of rose heads, then carefully threaded the lilies in among them. Finished, she slid out a sheet of pink paper and one of purple tissue and laid them tenderly atop each other on the worktable. She thought she could feel his gaze on her and moved more slowly, just for the pleasure of drawing out the moment. Then, with one unsteady hand, she raised the cleaver and brought it down on the flowers’ stems. She placed them at the trembling center of the paper and brought its edges together, carefully tying an orange ribbon around the bouquet’s middle. It wasn’t very nicely assembled, far more ragged than she would have liked, and she hoped he couldn’t tell. Yongjie made bouquets perfectly, so even across their tops that you could drape a cloth over them and mistake them for pedestals. When she turned to look at him, he was standing at the counter, back to her, but as though sensing her movement, he turned to look at her expectantly. Little trickles of thought bubbled up that she wanted to share with him, but she tamped them down as she handed him the flowers, feeling a jolt as he took them, as though they were an extension of her fingertips. It was foolish, she knew: The flowers were likely for a wife, or a mistress. “What do you do, anyway?” she asked hastily, trying to cover her embarrassment as she assumed her position again behind the counter. “I see so much of you, I’ve always wondered.” That was an understatement; in her mind she’d already constructed an elaborate life for him. He was a doctor specializing in the brain; he played the violin; he liked stinky tofu and walks in the park; he had been to Japan. He looked at her and smiled, and the clean lines of his shirt, the dark thatch of his hair, the contrast of it, made her ache. She wanted to lean over the counter and stare at each strand of hair, count the hair follicles on his chin. “I do sales,” he said. Then, examining her, as though rethinking his statement: “Well, I’m in sales,” he corrected himself, and there was that smile again. He laid the flowers carefully crosswise on the counter and began fishing for his wallet. “Here, I’ll give you my card.” Xiaolei looked down and studied it—it was matte and thick to the touch. The company wasn’t one she’d ever heard of; she wouldn’t insult him by asking what it did. Outside you could tell the time by the ranks of red taillights forming on the street; dusk was pressing in. Farther down the road was an expensive residential compound sealed with fat shrubs and a tall iron fence around its perimeter. The building, which bore the name Triumph Mansion, was six years old but still had the bewildered air of a fresh transplant; the neighborhood had not yet developed to match the pocketbooks or aspirations of its new residents. Xiaolei looked toward it now, as if for clues. Was she being rude by not speaking? Should she speak? His gaze was no longer on her as he fumbled, emptying his pockets, looking for his wallet. The silence had gone on too long. “It’s a nice neighborhood,” she said hesitatingly at last. “Do you live at Triumph Mansion?” He looked at her again, longer this time, his brow furrowed slightly. “I do,” he nodded, handing her some bills. “Do you?” This, of course, was sheer politesse; she was wearing a smock and could see this embarrassed realization cross his face as she shook her head and tried to think of what else to say. “A little farther out,” she said. He nodded absently, checked his watch. Desperation surged inside her; she’d already demanded more of him in two minutes than she had in two months. In another moment he would disappear, gone for another week. She counted out his change more deliberately than usual, willing him to ask her a question, any question. He didn’t. She paused. “Well, take care,” she said, unable to keep the regret from her voice. He smiled and picked up the bundle of flowers and inhaled. “Thank you,” he said. “See you.” After he left, she started sweeping the green scraps off the table with a wedge of newspaper, flushed in the cheeks, angry with herself. He’d thought her odd, surely, to be asking such questions. Maybe he wouldn’t even come back. Asking about Triumph Mansion must have sounded to him so aggressive and strange; she’d been greedy, should have left that question for another week, spaced out all the details she wanted to know. But then that would take months, years, and she didn’t want to be at this job that long. Later on, while helping another customer, she noticed a pen that had been left on the counter. It was black and thick-waisted with a narrow band of silver around its middle and a matching silver clip, a jagged white line on it depicting a mountain. She uncapped it and drew a long stroke against the back of a receipt—its ink was black and dense, and flowed under her touch like a thin, controlled river. It must have been his, she thought to herself, and dropped it into her pocket, where it landed with surprising weight. For an hour between the final two customers (no purchases), she filled out bouquets with the last salvageable flowers; they might sell more quickly that way the next day. As the cars thinned outside, she mixed bleach and water and was on her knees scrubbing out buckets on the sidewalk when she saw a woman stride past her into the store. After a moment Xiaolei followed her, patting her hands dry on her smock. Her first impression: big sunglasses with crystal-studded hinges resting on her head, and below that a makeup-free face, so flawless that Xiaolei couldn’t stop trying to seek out imperfections. She had on a pair of snug sweatpants and a pink purse that swung from a strap of golden chains. A soon-to-be bride, she thought, though surprising that she’d come alone and so late. A wife asking where else flowers had been sent, perhaps; it had happened once before. “My husband left his pen here,” the woman said. “Have you seen it?” A confusion of emotions drifted across Xiaolei’s face like clouds. She didn’t know what she’d expected the man’s wife to look like—not like this—but mentally she paid the woman tribute; she was beautiful, what he deserved, though frankly there was something off-putting about her face. She looked like the sort of woman who would feed a pet dog expensive food and dock her servants’ pay. An interval passed before Xiaolei realized that the silence had gone on too long. “We have some pens,” she said slowly, feeling heavy and shapeless in her smock. She went to the cash drawer and brought out a handful of ballpoint pens and laid them on the counter with ceremony. The woman shook her head, frustrated. “No, I’m talking about a nice pen,” she said. “Black, thick,” she said, and then she named the brand, which Xiaolei had never heard of. “You must have seen it.” She raised her eyes to Xiaolei’s and held them. It was like being trapped in a cobra’s gaze. After a minute, just to put an end to it, Xiaolei drew the pen unwillingly from her pocket. The woman’s face struggled between relief and annoyance that it had taken her so long. Relief won out. “Yes, that’s the one,” she said, and reached out to take the pen. “Thank you. It’s worth a lot.” Panic rose in Xiaolei, irrational and strong, and she pulled the pen back, just as quickly. She put on her best functionary’s voice, a mixture of boredom and witlessness. “I’m sorry. I can’t let you take it. I can only give it back to the pen’s owner.” “I’m his wife,” the woman said, her face now suspicious. “Do you have ID?” Xiaolei said. “Does that pen have ID?” the woman said. “What kind of question is that?” Xiaolei shrugged. “Look, it was an expensive pen, a gift from his boss. You wouldn’t want to get him into trouble, would you?” the woman said. “If I come back without it, he’ll be unhappy, and I’ll be unhappy.” Inside, Xiaolei stiffened. Then the woman smiled again, such a confident look, and that sealed it. She would not give the woman this pen, no indeed. There was no protocol for expensive lost pens, but if there were, Xiaolei was certain she would be in the right; surely one should return the lost item only to its owner. She sat down deliberately at her stool behind the counter, as though to cement her position. The woman stared at her. “Are you deaf? Give me the pen!” A couple was passing by outside, an elderly pair of retirees walking in that slow, stooped way of older people. She knew them by sight; the man used to walk a songbird in a cage by the shop in the mornings until one day he’d been alone, and she wondered what had become of the bird. On hearing the woman’s raised voice, they stopped and looked inquiringly at the scene. The woman made as though to go behind the counter. “Give it to me!” “No, and you need to stay in front of the counter!” Xiaolei’s reflexes were honed after years of living in the city; her right leg shot out and quickly blocked her. “Thief! Thief!” the woman shouted. “I’ll report you to the police!” Xiaolei was full of indignant fire now; she had what she needed to keep fighting all day. “Go ahead! I’m not going to violate protocol! We have rules,” she said proudly. Seeing the retirees hesitating at the doorway, Xiaolei quickly recruited them. “She wants me to just give it to her, but I can’t—there are policies.” The elderly woman seemed confused, but after hearing Xiaolei’s explanation, the man turned to the woman inside and spoke gently. “These policies are for your own protection,” he said. “Who would want their lost things to be given away so casually? Tell your husband, tell your husband to come back to the store and get it himself.” At this the woman turned tail and spit on the floor. “You’ll be sorry,” she said to Xiaolei, and walked out. Years later, lying awake in bed at night, Xiaolei sometimes thought of all the things she could have done differently. She could have handed back the pen, submitted to the woman, seen her husband the following week and pretended nothing had happened, continued to sell him flowers for weeks and months, an avalanche of roses, an eternity of lilies. She could have held on to the pen and returned it to the husband the next week, or the next day; probably he would have come back in person if it had been truly necessary. She could have kept it in her pocket and never returned to the store, perhaps pawned the pen. Used the money to start her own business. Instead, after the woman left, Xiaolei closed up the shop in a hurry; she didn’t want to risk her returning with the police. She took the pen back with her that evening, tucked inside her purse, and rode two buses to a night market, where she sat on a stool amid other workers finished with their shifts and ate a bowl of especially good noodle soup with pickled vegetables, then walked back in the direction of her rented room. That night she slept poorly, dreaming of the man who had died above her. In her dream, they were riding the same bus in the dark, the brightly lit buildings of Shanghai flashing by in a blur. He was seated a row behind her and leaning forward, his voice a steady, urgent murmur in her ear, the sound of it not unpleasant. He held a bundle of daisies, with petals that tickled her neck. Then the scene shifted, and they were whirling together on a dance floor lit up in an enormous, multicolored grid. The next day was Xiaolei’s day off. Usually she would lie in bed reading dime novels, or occasionally she’d go to the Bund, an hour’s bus ride away and one of the few destinations she knew. She liked to gaze across the water at the gleaming pink orbs of the Pearl Tower and the colored jets of light that illuminated the skyline. Sometimes she sat there for hours, long enough to see the skyscraper lights wink off, just before midnight. Her first year in Shanghai she went frequently, until she overheard a beautifully clad woman telling a friend it was where all the “country bumpkins went to stare.” After that, she didn’t go so often. Xiaolei remained in bed awhile, trying to go back to sleep, until at last she rose, feeling restless. She put on a white hooded sweatshirt—adorned with the word superstar, edged in gold trim—which she seldom wore for fear of getting it dirty. She donned a matching baseball hat, and her nicest pair of jeans. Under her bed she located a tube of bright-red lipstick, which she’d bought shortly after moving to the city. She’d worn it only once before wiping it off, ashamed and startled at the change in her appearance. Today she carefully applied it to her lips. She shouldered her purse and walked toward the bus, humming softly. When she’d first arrived in Shanghai, the girls at the bottling plant said there were two ways to make it: get rich or get married. But here she was, still working for a pittance, and the only man to make a pass at her had been her boss at the plant, who was married and three times her age. One day after she’d been there two years, he’d called her in to give her that week’s pay. As she bent over his desk to sign the receipt, he leaned against her and squeezed her chest, as though testing the firmness of a fruit at the market. “Do you like this?” he’d said, breath hot against her ear. Xiaolei had wrenched herself away and quit not long after, but occasionally she found herself wondering whether life would have been better if she hadn’t refused him. She got off the bus not far from Triumph Mansion. As she approached its thick shrubs, she walked more slowly, heart jumping. Its tall black gate was locked, but she loitered until she saw another resident leaving, and quickly slipped inside. It was easier than she’d imagined. Inside was an oasis, with shrubs clipped into spheres and a marble lobby that contained a golden statue of a trident-bearing angel. The air was perfumed, and from somewhere overhead, a melody was playing, pianissimo. A somnolent guard sat at the front desk, but his head snapped up on seeing Xiaolei. “Sign in,” he grunted. “I’m just waiting for a friend,” Xiaolei said, and ran one hand carelessly through her hair, a gesture borrowed from the man’s wife. The guard looked at her hard but didn’t say anything. There was a large mirror on one side of the lobby, and a white-leather bench opposite, which Xiaolei sank onto gratefully. She took out the pen and gazed at it briefly before slipping it self-consciously back in her bag. The man would thank her for returning the precious item. He would offer her cookies made from paper-thin crepes baked in tight scrolls, and tea served in fragile glassware. Back in the village, when she was not yet a teenager, she had watched a popular television show that depicted the lives of two women in a big-city apartment upholstered entirely in white—white-leather couch, white tufted rug, white lilies—and she pictured his apartment like that too. They would sit beside each other on the couch. He would press against her like her boss from the bottling plant, only this time, she would not resist. Hours passed. The air was cool and conditioned, and carried its own kind of quiet hush. A few men in suits and nannies with their beautifully dressed charges came and went. The security guard left and another took his place. Every now and then, Xiaolei pretended to be on the phone, but mostly she just sat and watched the scene. She felt perfectly content there, a thousand miles from the dusty village where she’d been raised, as comfortable as if she belonged. She liked observing the residents’ faces, so intelligent and refined, no doubt full of more clever things to say than just going to rain; guess so; have you eaten yet; yes, hot out today. She thought back to her grandfather’s 80th-birthday celebration, the year before he’d died. A crowd of villagers had assembled for roast fowl, and after a long string of toasts, he’d told them how glad he was that he’d lived all his life among them. He meant it with pride, the fact that he’d never left, but the thought had filled Xiaolei with horror, and she’d vowed to get away. A ding from the elevator interrupted her reverie. When she looked up, her favorite customer was disappearing into it, briefcase tucked neatly under one arm. She rose to follow, trying to look casual, but the elevator doors had already slid shut. The gold numbered panel overhead showed him getting off at the fourth floor. Up front, the guard was busy chatting with another resident. She hurried up the stairs in pursuit. She arrived just as he’d reached an apartment at the end of the hall and shut the door behind him. The floors here were carpeted in dark blue, with faux-crystal lamps above. She hung back, suddenly shy. It was very quiet. In a mirror by the elevator, she inspected her face carefully. She removed the baseball cap and wet her lips and smoothed her hair. You’ve come this far, she told herself. Don’t be afraid. A few minutes later she was knocking at his door, but there was no answer. After a long while she knocked again, more loudly this time, and heard footsteps. When the door opened, he was standing there in an undershirt and shorts, having just changed. “Yes?” he said impatiently. “Who are you?” Xiaolei tried to find her voice amid her surprise. “I’m—” “What do you want?” he said. No flicker of recognition registered in his eyes. Xiaolei heard a woman’s voice from somewhere deeper in the apartment. “I don’t know,” he called over his shoulder. He looked at Xiaolei again, more quizzically this time. “We’re not interested.” Inside, she could see a mahogany coffee table and a miniature fountain built into one wall that bubbled over a polished black orb. At the sight of Xiaolei, a white poodle curled on the couch stood and barked. The man still didn’t appear to recognize her. “I’m sorry,” she said, disappointment crashing over her in heavy waves. She began backing away. The man eyed her strangely. “That’s okay,” he said, and shut the door with a click. Somehow, Xiaolei found her way out of the apartment building, cheeks burning, looking neither left nor right as she hurried down the stairs. Outside, the cool air was a relief. She was sweating profusely and remembered just in time to strip off her white sweatshirt to keep it from getting stained. It was foolish of her to have gone. It was foolish of her to expect anything of him, to think someone like her might have made an impression on him. She pinched herself hard as punishment, leaving ugly red marks on her arm. She rode the bus and walked home in a daze; once back, she crawled immediately under the covers and lay there, a pit in her stomach and shame in her chest, until she fell asleep. It was only the next day—after four hours of trundling through the wholesale market in streets slicked with water and dawn half-light, after arriving back at the store to find Yongjie waiting there with an ominous expression—that she’d looked inside her purse and found the pen gone. She didn’t know if it had been stolen or perhaps slipped out. Anyway, it didn’t matter. The wife had found her boss early the previous morning. By the time Xiaolei returned to the shop the following day, arms sopping with bundles of flowers, Yongjie had made up her mind; she was fired. Plenty of other young girls could do the job, and probably better, besides. When Xiaolei heard the amount of money the woman claimed the pen was worth, it astounded her; it was nearly 20 times her monthly salary. “She must be lying,” she said desperately. “What pen costs that much?” Yongjie hadn’t heard of such a pen before either, Xiaolei was nearly sure of it, but she affected an instant sense of knowingness that came down like a shield. It was a famous European brand, she said. “Well, then it was probably fake,” Xiaolei said, feeling only briefly disloyal. “Who carries a pen like that around?” Yongjie didn’t disagree, but she also refused to pay any of the two weeks’ back wages Xiaolei was owed. “You’ve caused me that much trouble—count yourself lucky it isn’t worse,” she said. “Word will get around. Triumph Mansion is our key clientele, and now no one will want to come here.” Xiaolei didn’t bother to argue; Yongjie probably had a point. At the very least, she’d lost them one of their steadiest weekly customers. “I really did lose it,” she said, meaning the pen, but her boss wasn’t moved. “You know it doesn’t make a difference,” Yongjie said. She was poking white chrysanthemums into a stand of green foam, as if Xiaolei had already disappeared. In the months that followed, as she looked for another job, Xiaolei found herself stopping into the city’s small stationery stores seeking out its likeness, wondering if such an expensive pen could possibly exist, and if so, where to find it. She saw thin-stemmed ballpoints and some with outlandish pink or green ink; all kinds of imports were coming in now from South Korea, transparent ones and gel tips and retractables. She’d hold them in her hands, evaluating them, weighing their worth. Her only regrets were that she hadn’t spent more time with the man’s pen, cradling it, uncapping it, testing it out for herself, and that she hadn’t been able to keep it. She’d retraced her steps, of course, even interrogated some vendors at the wholesale market, and gone back to check the perimeter of Triumph Mansion, but found nothing. Even when she got another job, this time selling shampoo and conditioner door-to-door, the pen still haunted her. She’d bought a bicycle by then and would ride it up and down Shanghai’s streets, leaping off occasionally at stationery stores to check their racks in different seasons. It was a benign quest that gave her some control over a city that otherwise threatened to wear her down. Once, at a pharmacist’s, she saw a woman filling out a receipt with a fat black pen. Its shape was familiar, and her heart stopped. “May I try?” The clerk knitted her brows, but Xiaolei was sheepish and insistent, and at last the woman shrugged and gave her the pen and a piece of thin gray cardboard, the inside of a pillbox, to try it on. It was lighter than Xiaolei had remembered, and had no silver clip, no alpine etching. But it sat in her hand the same way, and it, too, had that glossy sheen. “How much?” she asked. The clerk frowned. “Not for sale,” she said. “Please,” Xiaolei said. She started writing with it. It wasn’t a fountain pen, she discovered; inside was a raspy ballpoint that skidded over the cardboard’s surface, leaving only a wisp of an imprint behind. “It works better on the pad,” the clerk said, and that was true. Xiaolei could see the receipt she’d just written out in a clear black hand. The clerk looked at her curiously, and then pushed the pad forward kindly. “You can try.” But Xiaolei had already disappeared out the door, shaking her head. “Thanks,” she called out behind her. “It’s not what I’m looking for.” This story is an excerpt from Te-Ping Chen’s upcoming collection, Land of Big Numbers."

        "story": "The academic triumphs of Professor Augustus Merrick of Hillbridge University were offset by a painful domestic trial: his three sons had been a disappointment. As each in turn emerged from the nursery chrysalis, he had been eagerly watched by an anxious father, an adoring elder sister, and a pair of tender and vigilant aunts; but not one had developed the least germ of artistic or intellectual feeling. Harold had early affirmed his intention of going into the Navy; Fred, after several years of golf and vacillation, had lapsed into marriage and a clerkship in a bank; and Armstrong, the youngest and most promising, had crowned a deplorable college career by becoming a successful stock-broker. “I don’t understand it,” poor Lucy Merrick used to say to her aunts, as they “talked the boys over” in the quiet Hillbridge drawing-room, with its sad-coloured walls hung with photographs after Benozzo Gozzoli and Burne-Jones. “I shall never understand why, with all their opportunities, all three of the poor dear boys should be such failures. Of course one doesn’t love them any the less—” It was not set in Lucy Merrick’s heart to love anyone less; the only difference she knew how to make was to love more. “Of course not,” the eldest Miss Arkell acquiesced. The Misses Arkell were Professor Merrick’s step-sisters, the offspring of his mother’s first marriage, but they embraced his views with an ardour that consanguinity does not always ensure. The second sister, Miss Candace Arkell (in that household the three syllables were insisted on) made a faint sound of dissent. She was even more zealous than her sister in her adhesion to Professor Merrick’s doctrines, and proportionately less disposed to condone his sons’ defection. “I cannot agree that one does not love them any the less,” she said firmly. “Armstrong, especially, with his talent for drawing—I remember, when he was a tiny boy, how he used to ask me to tell him the stories of the Burne-Jones pictures.” “I am afraid it was only the stories he cared for,” said Miss Arkell sighing. “And you know his drawings were all caricatures of the Professors.” The three ladies joined in a chorus of sighs, and Lucy, always distressed by any sign of resentment toward her poor brothers, asked gently: “Shall I read you another chapter of Epictetus?” The suggestion reminded her, as soon as she had spoken, of a painful occasion when Fred, being urged, in his undergraduate days, to bring some of his young friends home for five o’clock tea with his aunts, had protested rudely; “Five o’clock tea with Epictetus? Thanks a lot, but we’re breakfasting with him this term.” The perusal of the great Stoic philosopher was one of Professor Merrick’s favourite pursuits, and in this, as in all his other intellectual excursions, the cluster of ladies under his roof followed him with dauntless devotion. They really did not mind Epictetus: he was easy to understand, and his axioms (though Lucy thought them terribly stern) helped them to bear the boys’ defection. But when the Professor suggested that they should take up Kant and Hegel they realized with painful intensity their mental limitations. They were only three poor, loving, puzzled women, who could never understand that obeying the categorical imperative was just what they were doing every day of their lives. “Oh, if only one of the boys had cared!” Miss Candace lamented, one sultry afternoon when Lucy, roused by the suspiciously regular sound of Miss Arkell’s breathing, had laid down the Critique of Pure Reason. “You see it’s of no use for us to read philosophy if we can’t talk about it intelligently to your poor father—and we can’t. I could see how bored he was yesterday at dinner when I tried to tell him about our afternoon’s reading; and when he asks any questions every idea goes out of my head! Of course we have had every intellectual advantage in living with your father, and hearing his conversation, and following his advice about our reading—but women’s minds are so hopelessly inferior that we shall never be the companions he needs.” The sound of this outbreak roused the eldest Miss Arkell with a start. “That last paragraph was very striking, but a little obscure,” she murmured; and seeing her sister’s eyes fixed on her, she added guiltily: “At least it appeared so to me.” Miss Candace pushed aside the book with impatience. “It wasn’t only to you, my poor Joanna. We might as well all have been asleep, for all the good it has done us!” And Lucy, with her indefatigable patience, suggested: “Suppose we go back to Epictetus?” After their disastrous encounter with German metaphysics, it became more and more evident to the poor ladies that there was an intellectual void in Professor Merrick’s life which it could never be their privilege to fill. “If only the little boy had lived when your darling mother died!” Miss Candace sighed in confidence to Lucy; and Lucy, weeping, returned: “He would have been fourteen this January.” “And he might have been a genius—who knows?” “At least he might have been more like dear Papa.” “It seems to me so cruel, Lucy, that with your father’s marvellous gifts for educating the young—his extraordinarily formative influence on his students—he should have failed so completely with his sons.” “Oh, don’t be too hard on the poor boys, Aunt Candace!” “I don’t mean to be, dear; but it makes me feel—I can’t exactly explain why—that the poor baby who died was intended to make it up to him.” She was startled by the entrance of the Professor, a spare stooping man with carefully brushed grey hair and thin fastidious lips which could break into the most exquisite of smiles. “My dear Candace—my dear Lucy—” he began, and sat down abruptly, with a gasp of distress. The two women were upon him in an instant, hovering over him with little sounds of concern. “Dear Papa”—“My dear Augustus, do speak—do relieve us!” He held out a black-edged letter, tapping on it with an agitated hand. “The most distressing news—the most unforeseen and painful—” “Lucy, dear, open the window to give your father a little air; and run my dear, for the sherry—you’ll find the keys in your Aunt Joanna’s pocket.” The Professor raised a protesting hand. “Nonsense, Candace: I do not require any artificial stimulant. Compose yourselves, and I will explain what has happened.” The ladies obediently resumed their seats, and he adjusted a pair of gold-rimmed glasses to his high-bridged nose. “I have just heard that my friend—my poor friend George Alsopp—has died very suddenly—” Lucy sat silent, as though more surprised than distressed by this announcement, but Miss Candace broke in with a wail of sympathy. The Professor, however, raised his head and continued drily: “This fact is not, in itself, the immediate cause of my distress.” “Oh—” murmured Miss Candace, blushing at her own precipitation. “George Alsopp and I,” the Professor continued, “were college friends, as you know, and our friendship was maintained during his subsequent residence at Hillbridge; but when he was called to New York, to become a partner in his father’s banking-house, I realized that our interests had already diverged, and that only propinquity had served to hold us together. For poor George had already allowed himself to be mastered by a fatal vice—the passion for money-making—” The ladies emitted a sympathetic groan, and the Professor impressively continued: “Once in New York, he yielded to the grossest excesses in the gratification of this vulgar propensity—I am told that ten millions would be a low figure to put on the result.” “Ten millions—how dreadful!” Miss Candace shuddered. “Perhaps we should not judge him too harshly,” pursued the Professor, who was always unsettling her by thus abruptly changing his ground, “for I am told that his wife—who has since died—not only abetted him in his deplorable weakness, but actually goaded him to fresh efforts by her own extravagance. Business connected with the University obliged me to dine with them during my last visit to New York, and the senseless profusion of their table was only equalled by the painful indigence of their talk.” “To think that there are millions of our fellow-creatures being condemned to such a form of existence!” sighed Miss Candace, inflamed with missionary zeal. “Oh, hardly millions,” Lucy gently corrected; but the Professor went on without heeding their comments: “In this state of mental empoverishment [sic] my poor friend has suddenly died, leaving to his wretched family absolutely nothing but the means of material subsistence.” “Oh, it is too dreadful: I don’t wonder you feel it!” Miss Candace cried. “Of whom does the family consist?” Lucy quietly ventured to ask; and referring to his letter the Professor replied: “Of two children: a daughter, the eldest, who is already married, and a son—a boy of fourteen—” He paused, and after again glancing at the letter, concluded impressively: “A boy of fourteen, named Augustus Merrick Alsopp, whom his father has committed to my care.” Both ladies uttered a cry of surprise, and—“Oh, Papa—did you know he was named after you?” exclaimed Lucy, feeling herself thereby drawn to the stranger. “It is a circumstance I remember deploring at the time, though of course past associations forbade my making any open objection.” “I’m very glad you didn’t object. Perhaps the name has helped him—protected him.” The Professor smiled tenderly on his daughter: where intellectual matters were not in question, there were treasures of sympathy between himself and Lucy. “It is a vain hope, I fear; and the boy has always been called Gus.” “But we must insist on calling him Augustus, if you are to be his guardian,” Miss Candace exclaimed, rousing herself to a practical sense of the situation; while Lucy murmured: “It is strange he should be just fourteen.” “Too old to be greatly influenced I fear,” said the Professor, apparently unconscious of her allusion. “His father’s lawyer writes me that he already has his steam-launch and his motor.” “But if he comes here, Augustus—” interposed Miss Candace, aghast. The Professor eyed her solemnly. “If he comes here, Candace, we must all unite in ministering to his spiritual indigence.” Augustus Merrick Alsopp came. It was not in Professor Merrick to shirk a charge, however onerous, and Lucy was at his side to encourage him in all the valours of the heart. It appeared that the other guardian specified in Mr. Alsopp’s will was unable to offer the boy a home, so that the young Augustus, though possessed of such varied means of locomotion, was without a place in which he could come to a halt, unless the Hillbridge household took him in. The Misses Arkell, at the prospect, passed through alternating crises of despondency and exaltation; but Lucy remained steadfastly hopeful. Lucy’s creed was so simple: if there was a kindness to do, one had to do it; and if one did it, the result was sure to be satisfactory. “And after all,” she reminded her aunts, “for the next three years, he’ll be here only for the holidays.” “But how your poor father is going to stand another boy about the house—” “It will be interesting for Papa to form his mind, Aunt Joanna.” “But your poor father never could form his own sons’ minds—” “Perhaps he will have better luck this time, Aunt Candace.” “But think of the dreadful surroundings the youth comes from, Lucy!” “That’s just it, you dears; for how on earth could we leave him in them?” And this answer always temporarily convinced the aunts. When Gus Alsopp came, however, all their apprehensions revived. He arrived with a servant and a gold-fitted dressing-bag. The ladies were confronted by these awful facts before they realized that the person thus ushered into their lives was a shy plain little boy with a shock head and spectacles. When they had acquainted themselves with these particulars, and with the fact that the young Augustus, while he absorbed his tea and bread-butter, kept his spectacled gaze obstinately fixed on the Burne-Jones above the mantle-piece, they began to feel more leniently toward him. When he had emptied his cup he approached the mantel-piece, and said timidly to Miss Arkell: “What is the subject of that picture?” He listened attentively while she expounded the allegory, but she saw that he was lamentably deficient in the rudiments of classical mythology. When she had finished, he asked with a blush if he might speak to Professor Merrick. The Professor, meanwhile, was closeted with Miss Candace, who was explaining with tears that the cook and the parlour-maid, women of spotless but untried virtue, both threatened to leave if there was “a man in the house”; while the laundress, more inured to temptation, valiantly declared that she’d “like to see him come into her laundry.” The Professor was exasperated by this unexpected complication. “I daresay she would!” he exclaimed recklessly; and upon this subversive sentiment the young Augustus entered. “I have come, sir,” he said, “to ask if it’s necessary for me to keep a valet.” “Necessary—?” gasped the Professor; and his namesake eagerly continued: “I really like roughing it, you know; and I can dress a great deal quicker by myself.” The valet was dismissed and the gold-topped toilet-articles were put away in tissue paper by Miss Candace. Augustus, who showed symptoms of a thrifty spirit, replaced them with a wooden brush and a celluloid comb; and though the departing valet left him a bottle of varnish, with tearful instructions how to use it, he preferred to have his boots blackened like the Professor’s. Augustus had begun his education at a fashionable boarding-school, where muscular Christianity triumphed, and the studious boys formed a pale and neglected minority. He came to Hillbridge during the summer holidays, and before the beginning of the new term he had unbosomed himself on the subject of his education to the Professor. “I don’t know anything,” he said, “and I never shall, as long as I stay at St Christopher’s. I’d never even heard of Perseus and Medea in that picture; I should like to go somewhere where a fellow can find out something besides cricket.” It cannot be denied that the Professor was pleased. In season and out of season he had denounced the excesses of muscle-worship, and it was a wonderful opportunity to find one of its unwilling victims under his hand. Gus Alsopp was cited throughout Hillbridge as an instance of the intelligent reaction against an unmixed diet of athletics, and the Professor, in a burst of exaltation, decided to send him to an admirable day-school in the town itself, in order to keep him within reach of elevating influences throughout the year. “It’s very beautiful of your father—if only Augustus doesn’t take to slamming doors when he’s more used to us!” exclaimed Miss Arkell, recalling a tumultuous year when Freddy, having been “dropped” from school, had kept the Burne-Joneses in the drawing-room perpetually bounding on their hooks. Under the stimulus of this memory she ventured to take Augustus aside and entreat him to use the doors gently. He stared at her through his spectacles with surprise. “There is nothing,” he said, “more unintelligent than a superfluous expenditure of energy,” and for an awful moment she thought he was taking off the Professor. But she soon realized that a profound veneration for his guardian had already led Augustus to acquire the Professor’s vocabulary, which he used unconsciously, and sometimes with startling effect, but never with the least intention of irony. The uses of humour were in fact unknown to young Alsopp; and in a household where they were cultivated he might have been considered dull. But the Professor’s idea of humour was principally of a missile directed against himself or his most cherished convictions; and its absence from the mental make-up of his ward seemed to him, for the moment, another evidence of the latter’s exceptional promise. The Professor was already building great hopes on young Augustus; and Lucy, as she watched the airy structure rise, became more and more persuaded that the anthropomorphic Providence in whom her instincts incorrigibly trusted, had created Gus to “make up” for the deficiencies of her brothers. For a while the aunts, less sanguine or more sceptical, had watched the new member of their household for some token of unregeneracy. If there was anything in “environment”—and why had they been made to plough through so many thick volumes on evolution if there were not?—then the poor boy seemed fated to show in some form the contaminating influences of his past. Miss Candace, in particular, was keen on the trail of these influences. She sniffed about his threshold for traces of cigarette-smoke, she watched his conversation for allusions to the race-course and the money-market, she even invented an excuse for rummaging his drawers in the search for French novels and cards. But Augustus made no allusion to his past; the only hidden literature she discovered among his underclothes consisted in Mill’s Logic and a volume of Haeckel; and every month he brought his allowance to the Professor and asked him to deposit it in the Savings Bank. It never occurred to him to make any purchases, for books were the only things he cared to buy, and the Professor’s library furnished him with more than he had ever dreamed of as existing. As for his clothes, he would have let them fall apart if Miss Candace had not been there to prevent such a contingency; and when the housemaid’s needle could no longer hold them together, it was Miss Candace herself who had to suggest to the young millionaire that his wardrobe needed renewing. Gus took the announcement rather helplessly. “Harris always got my things for me,” he said, making his first and only reference to the departed valet; and it ended in the Misses Arkell having to fit him out according to their own lights at the leading “ready-made” establishment of Hillbridge. To Lucy’s eyes, which were more observant than her aunts’, Augustus looked a little odder than usual in the ties and collars of their selection; but he seemed unconscious of anything peculiar in his attire, beyond the discomfort of its newness, which in his case persisted longer than with most boys, because he did so little to endanger it. In short, if Gus Alsopp caused any disappointment to his adopted family it was that secretly engendered by the discovery that he was so little in need of regeneration. The Misses Arkell had been prepared, as the Professor put it, to minister to his spiritual indigence; but while there was much to be done in the way of instruction, they were reluctantly obliged to admit that exhortation and admonition were superfluous. Gus was passionately eager to learn, and painfully conscious of his ignorance; but he learned so rapidly and remembered so well, that he was soon beyond the reach of any teaching but the Professor’s. As to admonishing against the temptations of idleness and extravagance, or urging upon him the advantages of high thinking and sober living, it was as superfluous as recommending the water to a newly-hatched duck. Gus took to the development of the higher faculties as instinctively as the Professor’s sons had taken to sport and warfare and money-making; and if it had been in Lucy’s heart to feel untenderly toward any one, she would almost have resented the way in which his merits reflected on the failings of those unregenerate young men. But how could she fail to cherish any one so evidently predestined to console the Professor for his paternal disappointments? Her father’s happiness in Gus was all-sufficient to Lucy: if she herself felt in him a little dryness, a slight lack of effervescence of youth, she set it down to a wicked fear of his supplanting her brothers. ​"

        "story": "My boys are standing at the edge of the jetty, and either they will jump or they won’t jump. It is early summer, June, under the great bell of the sky, on the island on which I was raised. The waves are coming in from such a long way off that no one can say when or where their turbulence began, only that they are the transmittance of an energy that finally breaks here and resolves into the shore. I watch them, my two boys, from the sand. My father, unusually quiet today, wearing a hat against the sun, watches too. He isn’t yet old, but at this very moment I can’t recall exactly how old he is. If his life seems long to me, it’s because he has changed more than anyone I know. One day, over the course of many years—there is no other way to put it—he took all his great anger out to sea, let the wind out of its sails, and came back home without it. Came back home with a stillness and patience where once the rocking fury had been. Sometimes I forget my own age too. When people ask the ages of my boys, I round up to give myself time to get used to where they are going. But although my father doesn’t have very much time left, and I have some, my boys still have all the time in the world. The younger one does a little dance on the edge of the jetty. The older one tilts back his head, spreads his arms, and shouts something toward the sky. I watch my boys and talk, and my father listens. Life, I say, or am trying to say, which is always happening on so many levels, all at the same time. That summer, while her boys are on vacation with their father, she goes to visit her lover in Berlin. “You see,” he says, leaning down toward her and lowering his voice so that those passing by won’t hear, “one thing you don’t know about me is that I like to serve.” It is a surprising thing to hear, coming from a man two meters tall and built like a heavyweight. In fact, he is an amateur boxer, or rather was one for many years, until a month ago, when an attack of Schwindel—of vertigo—briefly hospitalized him, turned up a scar in his brain, and put an end to it. And yet, though he claims that he will never step foot in the ring again and though he is employed as an editor at a highly respected newspaper, she still privately refers to him, both to her friends and to herself, as the German Boxer. It is easier than using his name, which means “little gift from the gods”—because of that, and because calling him the German Boxer highlights their differences, and preserves a sense of ironic distance that keeps her grounded in the new land she’s recently discovered, like some Christopher Columbus of the soul: the land of being unattached and free. They are walking around Schlachtensee—a long, thin lake at the edge of the Grunewald Forest—discussing whether or not 80 years ago he would have been a Nazi. The German Boxer thinks it is moral grandstanding to claim that he would not have been, as most everyone else in his generation claims, but now he goes beyond the usual argument of how he would have been shaped by historical forces that would have made his participation nearly inevitable, to offer the particular vulnerabilities of his own character. “I am exactly the kind of person they would have recruited for the Napola,” he says, referring to the elite preparatory schools where they groomed the strong, obedient, and relatively clever German youth into leaders of the SS. “I’ve always overly idolized my mentors and striven to fulfill every last demand they made of me, because it struck fear in me to imagine failing their expectations. That, along with my size and build, makes me just the sort of person they would have wanted. And, being wanted, I would have felt honored. It’s my weakness for honor and praise, you see, that would have sent me right into the ranks of the SS.” “Plus you would have loved the uniform,” she adds, thinking of the row of white shirts tailored in London that hang on a bar in the sunlight of his bedroom, of his suits made in Naples not only to his measurements but also to his precise taste (no silk, no lining at all, only materials rough to the touch), his winter coat of wool so finely stitched that he avoids putting his hands in the pockets for fear of ruining it. Of his white-leather boxing gloves, handmade by Winning in Japan to fit his slim fingers and wrists. She does not offer this evidence gladly. She would prefer to believe that the man she is sleeping with could not have been, under any circumstances, a Nazi. But by now she knows him well enough that she can’t truly disagree. Along the shore of the lake, lovers spoon in the sunlight or under the alders, kissing or lazily stroking each other’s half-naked bodies, and whenever she and the German Boxer pass an attractive couple, he points them out with a sign of appreciation, or maybe even envy. He was happily married for nearly a decade, blazingly happy, as he describes it, until his wife, an actress, left him for the man who played Lancelot to her Guinevere at the Volksbühne. Since then he’s lost the feeling he’s had all his life of being blessed and untouchable. Those close to him see this as a positive development, he admits, since until his divorce felled him, he was often insufferable. But he has been broken by it, and he would have preferred to remain happy and insufferable than whatever he is now. Arriving at the beer garden at the eastern end of the lake, they stop to have a drink. It is a Sunday, and the tables covered with red-and-white-checked cloths are crowded with Germans enjoying their nature. Joyful shouts of children float up from the water’s edge. The German Boxer is telling her that her older son’s lankiness and long arms, which he’s seen in a photo, would make him an excellent boxer, and it does not seem necessary to her to repeat that her son would never box, that her son is nearly as far from boxing as he is from being German. Not finding a foothold, the conversation moves on to Oktoberfest, and he begins to explain to her what a dirndl is. “But you would have killed?” she asks now, though perhaps with less incredulity than she might have expressed toward someone who had not, on occasion, knocked out a stranger with a single punch, or nearly snapped the wooden bars of her headboard because in the midst of orgasm he experienced an uncontainable desire to destroy something. “Of course I would have killed,” he says. “Killed while believing—having been built to believe—that I was doing the right thing.” “I could never kill anyone,” she insists. Over the top of his beer glass, the German Boxer eyes her with a look of polite skepticism. And it is true that as soon as she has made this assertion, her mind begins involuntarily to supply exceptions. When, a few days later, she makes reference in a text to him showing up at her door in 1941 in leather boots, he replies that one thing he could not have done was kill innocent people. This seems in contradiction to what he so plainly asserted while walking in placid sunshine around the lake, but when she writes back to clarify which people it was that he had been so certain he could kill, her text remains unanswered, hanging in WhatsApp limbo, stamped with only a single gray check, because the German Boxer likes to turn his phone off when he feels finished with it. Later, when she meets him for dinner at a vegetarian restaurant in Mitte, he says that of course he couldn’t have knocked on people’s doors and deported or executed them. What kind of person does she think he is? When he said he could kill people, he meant in battle, because he was sure that he would have been assigned to the Waffen-SS and sent to the front. She does not have the wherewithal just then to ask what makes him so sure he wouldn’t have been assigned to the Gestapo; or the Allgemeine-SS, responsible for enforcing Nazi racial policies; or even the Death’s Head units, which oversaw the concentration and extermination camps. They sit in silence, waiting for their dumplings to come. After a few moments, the German Boxer suggests that he might be wrong. After all, he says, his grandfather was in constant trouble with the Nazis because he’d allowed Romanis to stay on his land, his great-grandfather was murdered in Aktion T4, and his father was the sort of man who refused to follow anyone. No, perhaps he wouldn’t have been a Nazi after all—let’s hope as much, he says. She nods. In truth, she agrees that their conversation is an impossible one, given that whoever he is now would not have been who he’d have been back then, shaped as he would have been by different forces, and whoever he’d have been then did not exist. Though, naturally, she continues to think about it. A mutual friend set them up in New York, and over email they agreed to have dinner the following night. He asked if they could meet on the later side, because he would be boxing in the afternoon. Where did he box? she asked; she was curious to see this. In fact, she had never seen anyone box, not even on TV, since brutality and blood made her queasy. He wrote that she wouldn’t want to meet him after he sparred, that it was the kind of gym where no one showered, but that if he liked her after tomorrow, he would take her to the gym and they would fight; until then, it would remain a secret gym. “Nobody knows me there, or what I do or what I think or what I want,” he wrote. She read his email three times, then replied that he ought to be careful, that she was deadly. She didn’t know exactly why she wrote that. Maybe because of the arrogance in his phrasing, the indirect challenge of it: If I still like you. Because of the sense of pride it tripped loose in her, even if she knew he was writing in a language not his own, without the nuance he had in German, and because she wanted him to know that she was someone who had—who had always had—a certain power over men. Or because she wished to imply that whatever was explosive in him was also explosive in her, that there might be a parity there, and maybe more than a parity: that the scales of explosiveness, of a form of strength, might even tip in her favor. Which may or may not have been grandstanding. “My ribs have a tendency to break,” he wrote back. “Please be careful when destroying me.” In other words, he knew exactly what to do with her. Caught her and spun her around and drew her close; knew how to work her, knew just what a mix of strength and vulnerability in a man can do to certain women, of which she was apparently one. As it was, after this brief exchange she knew that she would take him home to bed. When she arrived at the restaurant, he was already there, the way German trains are always already there, waiting in the station. His size was something else again. It was impossible not to notice him, looming a head or even two above everyone around him. If someone asked her in that moment—the waiter, for example, going past with his tray held high—whether she liked being made to feel physically small next to a man, she would have had to answer yes. Yes, but with an asterisk! *Physically small but spiritually powerful. In other words, she liked him to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing until she said he could be a wolf, and then he should be pure wolf with no trace of the sheep for the duration of time they would spend fucking in her bed, after which he should go back to being someone who wouldn’t in a million years think of grabbing her throat when he wanted something. Was this a problem? And one more thing: From time to time, he should be very slow and gentle when he went about blowing her house down. He handed her a stem of tiny, pale-purple flowers. She thought he’d picked them on the way, but later it turned out that he’d bought a whole bouquet, but given the rest away to a pregnant woman on the subway who’d admired them and asked whom they were for, because at that moment it occurred to him that he’d bought a bouquet of flowers for a stranger, which might have been overdoing it. They were shown to their table. The restaurant was dim and warm, the walls lined with the old glass cabinets of the pharmacy the place had been until, after having been boarded up for decades, it reopened as an Italian restaurant. Whenever a waiter or waitress came to the table, the German Boxer stopped what he was saying to smile and thank them for whatever they had just set down. The conversation moved lightly, swiftly. His nose didn’t break easily, only his ribs, he told her, and his lips—his lips tended to get busted and bleed when he boxed, because they were big. He asked if she had long arms, and before she could answer, he took her hand across the table and guided it to where his bottom-left rib stuck out because it had been broken clean through, leaving it to float unattached in his body. The waiter came and poured their wine. When he was gone, she took the German Boxer’s hand and guided it to the same rib on her body, which jutted out at the same angle, and had been that way for as long as she could remember. “How is that possible?” he asked in surprise. “You must have broken yours too.” But as far as she knew, she had never broken any ribs. The ribs, it seemed to her, went all the way back to the beginning, and were trying to say something amid their generational confusion about what it was to be a man and what it was to be a woman, and if these things could be said to be equal, or different but equal, or no. Her bed, which was queen-size, was too small for the German Boxer, so he had to curl up in it like a child. The light from a Himalayan salt lamp cast his torso in a warm, pinkish hue. They spoke about: his growing up on a farm near the North Sea and how, when his family went to other people’s houses for dinner, they always brought flowers picked from the fields, how this had instilled in him a sense that all flowers should look as if they had been stolen; the books they liked; whether it was strange to be a German man in bed with a Jewish woman whose grandparents were Holocaust survivors; her sister; his brother; the fact that she never wanted to get married again; the fact that nowadays it was often older women with much younger men, men who wanted to have children that the women, like her, had already had; the problem with monogamy; the problems without monogamy; his belief that boxing was not about violence but about discipline, physical discipline and the discipline of facing his fears. Then it was four in the morning, and he said he had to go home. She told him he could sleep there. But he couldn’t, he said, sitting up and pulling on his jeans. He couldn’t fall asleep with someone else in the bed. When she expressed surprise, his face darkened. “No one likes it,” he said, as if a referendum had been held and the results decisive. When his wife had left him for another man, she’d told him that it was because the other man held her as they fell asleep. Of course, there had been other reasons for her dissatisfaction, too. When she finally admitted that she was in love with someone else and was going to leave the German Boxer, she did it by phone, and during the conversation he took notes so that he wouldn’t forget anything. These he took down on the endpapers of Ghosts by Daylight, a memoir by a journalist on her 20 years of reporting from war zones. And at the top of the list, underlined twice: the fact that he had been unable to hold his wife through the night. It wasn’t that he didn’t wish he could sleep next to someone, he told her now. He simply couldn’t find any peace that way. He remained alert, on edge, and so it could take him hours to fall asleep, a problem exacerbated by the fact that he knew that if he didn’t get enough sleep, he was likely to get a migraine. He had been getting migraines since he was 13. They arrived with an aura that blacked out parts of his vision, and when they came the only thing he could do was curl up in a fetal position until they passed. Though it was impossible to say exactly what caused them, he was certain that lack of sleep was a factor, and so sleep had become of paramount importance. Only when he was alone did he feel at peace, and then he fell asleep moments after his head touched the pillow. It had been like that always, he told her. The last time he could remember sleeping well with someone next to him was when he was 5, and had asked his mother to sit by the bed and hold his hand. But he still remembered the serenity of that, the goodness. And yet, whenever the German Boxer spoke of the unhappiness his inability had caused his wife and other women since her, his tone became frustrated and resentful: Why couldn’t they understand that it was bad for him to share a bed? That it caused him to suffer? On the only night they ever slept together in a bed—they were in the middle of a forest; he had no choice—he asked her if she minded if he said the Lord’s Prayer. He had just flipped her over, pinned her arm hard against her back, and leaned his 200 pounds into her. Now they were lying peacefully, her back against his stomach, his long arms around her. “Vater unser im Himmel, geheiligt werde dein Name,” he whispered. “Dein Reich komme; dein Wille geschehe, wie im Himmel so auf Erden.” That same summer—the summer her boys were 13 and 10, and she was sleeping and not sleeping with the German Boxer—she’d been driving with her friend Rafi back from the moshav where he’d grown up, outside Tel Aviv. The name of the moshav was Freedom, though it sounded better in Hebrew, less remarkable, but all the same that was the place where he was born and grew up, and as they approached on a dusty road that wound through fields of orange trees, their children shouting in the back seat, he told her that when he’d at last begun to see a therapist, at the age of 42, he’d asked aloud, almost to himself, in the way that one can ask unanswerable questions aloud in the presence of such people, “What do I want? What is it that I really want?” To which the therapist had answered, “What you’ve always wanted: freedom.” It was Saturday, and they’d left Tel Aviv early that morning. Rafi had texted her when she woke to ask what she was doing with the kids, and to suggest that they all go somewhere together. Where? she’d written back. To the fields of my childhood, he replied. Their children, all boys, got along well enough that they usually wandered off to kick a ball or climb something, leaving her and Rafi alone to talk. Rafi was a dancer, had been one since the age of 3, when he’d started in his mother’s dance studio. Everything always began and ended for him with the body, whereas she had spent many long years in her mind (or so it felt to her), and had fully emerged into her body only after she’d borne one child and then another, after she’d fulfilled the commands of her biology, and, having done with it, at last took up true residence in her body, and started to dance at the age of 35. Sometimes they talked about this, and sometimes they talked about their relationships, or the things they still wanted from life. The boys ran wildly around the playground where Rafi had lost his virginity. He’d had sex everywhere around there, he told her—in that once-abandoned building; behind that shed; up on that dry, grassy hill. Next they all went to his childhood house, and the boys filled their pockets with red lychees from the tree and got bitten by nasty ants in the grass, and then they drove to the neighboring Arab village for lunch and got chastised by the owner of the hummus place for giving their dog water from a bowl that humans ate out of. A plastic takeout box was brought for the water, which the dog didn’t want anyway. Now they were on the highway driving home, and she was saying to Rafi that all week people had been telling her the most astonishing stories. She was not aware of having asked for these intimate and staggering stories about their lives, but maybe in her way she had been; maybe she had the look of someone who was trying to work something out, something at once vast and fleeting, which could never be approached head on but only anecdotally. The sea was going by turquoise in the passenger window. The kids were laughing or complaining. “I told you the one about the chicken under the car in Lebanon, didn’t I?” Rafi asked. No, he hadn’t, she said; she would have remembered if he had. Rafi might have been a dancer, but from the ages of 18 to 23 he’d been in the Sayeret Golani, an elite special-forces unit known for the physical extremes demanded of its soldiers. To become a man in his country was to become a soldier—being a soldier was the passage you had to go through, whether you liked it or not, on the way to becoming a man, though no one could say exactly when along that passage you stopped being a boy. The first time you fired your gun at a moving target? The first time you saw the enemy as an animal? Or the first time you treated him like one? Like every other 18-year-old, Rafi had no choice but to enlist. But he had not been required to go through the grueling selection process to be chosen for the special forces, or the year of masochistic training that followed; nor had it been required, after completing three years of necessary service, to sign on for another two years as an officer. Yet it had always been Rafi’s understanding with himself that he would serve in the special forces, in a unit that would push him to the furthest limits of his physical and mental capacity. That he would become an animal, but a pure animal that operates on instinct alone, like the flying tiger, which was the symbol of the Sayeret Golani, and which its commandos received during the induction ceremony in the form of a small metal pin. “There would be a field of thorns,” Rafi told her, “and you’d have to cross it. And to do so, your mind simply has to refuse to consider the pain. To think only about getting across, to make the pain irrelevant.” Or there was Hunger Week, during which the recruits were not allowed to eat or sleep for seven days. Each evening, the officers would make a barbecue next to the starving recruits. They would grill steaks, lay out a feast, and then say to the recruits, “Come, why don’t you eat with us?” And if someone gave in to his hunger and ate, that was the end: Just like that, he’d fallen, and that same day he was sent back to the regular infantry. Once, the officers gave out chocolate balls. “Just a small treat,” they said. “We’ll all eat them together.” And on the count of three the soldiers put them in their mouths and bit down on what turned out to be balls of goat shit. Of course he had been ready to die for his country, Rafi told her. To believe that one was willing to die for one’s country was the bare minimum required to even enter into the selection process, though along the way many boys or men discovered that they were too afraid to die or to suffer, that they couldn’t dissolve their fear so that it seeped out like an odor from the pores of their skin, and the moment this was detected, they were immediately disqualified. It was not until later, after Rafi was discharged from the army and fell in love, that he came to see the grotesqueness and absurdity of dying for one’s country, of dying and also being willing to kill. In the back seat, their boys became quiet: The oldest one, the only one with a phone, had taken it out, and the others were leaning in to see. It had happened when he was an officer, during the years that Israel had occupied southern Lebanon. His unit was given the assignment to kill the Hezbollah leader in the region. Intelligence knew that every single day at 6:30 a.m. sharp, the Hezbollah chief left the house and got into his car, and their instructions were to rig the engine with a bomb. There were 15 men in Rafi’s unit, and they were carried over the border by helicopter and dropped at a mountain hideout. At 10 p.m., they set out crawling down the mountain and through the fields. For four hours they dragged themselves along on their stomachs until finally they arrived at the village. A UN convoy was there, and the peacemakers were up laughing and drinking, because the UN people are always happy, Rafi said, for them, it’s just one long party. The unit slid past the UN tent on their stomachs and surrounded the house of the Hezbollah leader. As the officer of his unit, Rafi was positioned near the front door, and it was then, lying on his stomach with his gun trained on it while the explosion specialist disappeared under the car, that he noticed the pairs of children’s shoes. Three or four pairs lined up at the entrance, little rubber sandals just like he and his brothers used to wear on the moshav, when they wore shoes at all. No one had mentioned any children. Though why would they have? Children had no value in the calculus of military operations or wars. And in all of his nearly five years in the army, no one had ever told him anything beyond what he needed to know, and he hadn’t asked. About civilians, the question had only ever been: Should you encounter one in your mission, what will you do? Of which the only three options were: kidnap, kill, or let them go, and no answer was right or good. And yet the fact that Rafi had not known about the children and now was lying 10 meters from their sandals disturbed him. At that moment he felt a tap on his shoulder and, lifting his eye from the crosshairs of his gun, he saw the face of the explosion specialist, painted dark green like his. The specialist gave him the thumbs-up: The bomb was in place, rigged to go off the moment the Hezbollah chief touched his foot to the gas pedal. Rafi signaled to his men to retreat, and for four hours they crawled back on their stomachs to the mountain hideout, where they collapsed in exhaustion. By then it was close to the hour that the Hezbollah chief left his house every day and got into his car. An unmanned aircraft flew overhead and provided grainy footage of what was happening on the ground, and at 6:20 the unit gathered around the display monitor and waited. There on the screen was the house they had left four hours before, dark and still. First it was 6:28, then 6:30, then 6:35, and nothing; 6:45, 7, 7:15, and only that haunting stillness. “What the fuck?” someone said more than once, possibly many times. Intelligence had established that each day without fail, at 6:30 sharp, the Hezbollah chief stepped out of his house and got into his car. So what was going on? Seven-thirty arrived, and still nothing. Rafi radioed to the general of the Northern Command. “Boxer to Kodkod North, over. What’s happening?” “Kodkod North to Boxer”—because Boxer was always the radio name of Rafi’s position, the officer of the anti-terror unit—“Kodkod North to Boxer, stand by, over.” Then, just after eight, the door of the house opened, and the whole family stepped out. Rafi, who was holding the monitor, felt himself grow cold. In the grainy picture, the father, the mother, and three children approached the car, opened the doors, and disappeared inside. The bomb was rigged such that turning the key in the ignition and engaging the engine activated it, but detonation occurred only at the first millimeter of movement on the gas pedal. At the first millimeter of movement, the car and all of its passengers would be blown to pieces. The doors of the car closed, and now there passed a moment of stillness before the key was turned and the engine came alive. “We have ignition,” came the confirmation over the radio. “The seconds that followed, as I remember them now, were the longest of my life,” Rafi said. “I sat watching and waiting, in a state of complete and total horror. One second, two seconds, five. And then after 10 seconds, the driver’s door opened, and the Hezbollah chief got out, bent over to look under the car, and pulled out a chicken.” It must have been a family chicken, beloved enough that someone in the car would have asked about its whereabouts before they pulled away. Where is—whatever her name was—look, she’s not there with the others! Or I just saw so-and-so run under the car, she hates it when we leave, she always does this. Or whatever one of the kids piled into the back seat said the moment before their father applied the first touch of pressure to the gas, which would have exploded them all in an instant. “Out came the chicken,” Rafi said, “and then the guy ducks down again for a second look, straightens up, and orders everyone out of the car. All the doors flew open, the kids tumbled out along with the wife, and everyone went back into the house. Around me, many of my soldiers were furious—all of that for nothing, the mission had failed, our superiors were pissed off as hell.” And him? she asked. How did he feel? “The thing is,” he said, “that I can’t remember. And the more time passes, the more I feel I need to know what it seems I will never know: whether I was relieved, whether I understood at that moment that that chicken had saved my life, too, or whether I was no longer even an animal, and had become a machine.” It was late afternoon now, and they were driving away from Freedom, a fact that wasn’t lost on either Rafi or her. She’d had boyfriends one after another before marrying, and then after a decade of marriage she’d gotten divorced, and after that she’d been with a younger man for a long time, until now, at last, for the first time in 20 years, she wasn’t attached to any man at all. It was a lack that had first produced in her a sense of terror that went so far back that she couldn’t identify its source. At the start of what had become a nightmarish period, she had met a friend for lunch who’d said to her, “There is no woman, however loved, who isn’t terrified of abandonment,” and for a very long time she’d tried to work out what that meant. Was it only because the friend was much older, shaped by a time in which women had little or no access to the avenues that might lead to self-sufficiency and independence, that she believed this? When she herself thought about it, there was very little left that a man could give her that she really needed, aside from sex, which was easy enough to find. After six months of panic attacks, unremitting insomnia, and depression, the fear of being alone, without the life support of a man, had at last receded and been replaced with a feeling of quiet euphoria. As for Rafi, a year earlier he and his wife had decided to open their relationship of 23 years. They had a good and loving marriage, the heat between them had remained, and still they had arrived at the decision together, with the desire for growth and new discoveries. At first Rafi was unsure if he would ever want another woman. He thought he might be like his father, for whom his mother had remained the main force in his life, and to whom his father had remained entirely dedicated. And then, during a residency abroad, Rafi slept with a much younger dancer from Korea, with whom he thought he was in love, until he met another from Thailand who blew his mind. When he returned home, the Thai woman broke things off from Bangkok, and after some weeks of pain, there was a very young French woman, then two or three Israelis. Meanwhile, during that time, his wife went to the beach with their children, and while they played in the waves with the dog, she met and fell in love with a man 15 years younger than her. Rafi and his wife had not made any rules before they started. To make rules about freedom had seemed antithetical; either that, or they had been too impatient to hold the dreary, diplomatic conference that would have been necessary to establish such rules. But very quickly it had become clear that the absence of rules led to enormous pain, and though love can be mutual and shared, pain only ever happens in a place of radical aloneness. During the tumultuous period that followed, both Rafi and his wife, Dana, had often called her to talk. She had heard the story from both sides, or the two different stories, which as the weeks passed came to resemble one another less. She’d had to be careful not to share with Rafi what Dana confided in her, and not to share with Dana what Rafi confided in her, which became more difficult and exhausting as their stories diverged, and the pain and anger on both sides became greater. Dana remained with the younger man for five months. The days and nights when she would return to their apartment after making love to him, or during which she would endlessly check her phone for his texts, were nearly unbearable for Rafi. He would sit smoking a joint on the terrace, surrounded by the brown, shriveled potted plants that hadn’t survived the brilliance of the Israeli sun, and sometimes he listened to the sea, and sometimes he realized that he was talking aloud to himself. What did the young boyfriend give her that he didn’t? He, who all his life had been a dancer, had always found that everything began and ended with the body, but Dana was an actor and a playwright, and she had always moved as fluently and swiftly in language as she had through space, and he couldn’t always reach her there, in the realm of words. Could the boyfriend? Rafi had experienced enough pleasure in new bodies to know how exciting it was; that much he didn’t have to imagine. And yet of course he couldn’t help but imagine it all, regardless. He drove himself crazy imagining it, and when at last he couldn’t take any more pain, he broke down and asked Dana to end the relationship with the boyfriend, but two days later he changed his mind again, having absorbed the fact that if she ended it because he’d asked her to, that might also be the end of the experiment, and he was no longer who he had been before it began. In other words, he no longer wondered whether he was a man for whom the main force in his life was the one woman he was married to. He was finding things out about himself, his sense of himself was expanding, and he didn’t want to lose his new freedom, however painful it was to live next to his wife while she enjoyed hers. But it was too late. In the meantime, Dana, who had taken his pain to heart and did not want to destroy their marriage or their family, had told the boyfriend that they had to end things. And he came to agree: The situation was too much for the boyfriend, too. He wanted to have children, and though he was in love with Dana, he wished to find a woman he could make a life with, one his own age who wasn’t already married to someone else. Dana was heartbroken, and even more so when she found out, soon afterward, that he had begun to date a yoga teacher. She watched his online activity on WhatsApp so closely that she could tell when he was doing something outside of his normal schedule. If she texted him, she waited to see how long it took for there to be two blue checks, and if the checks stayed gray, she was miserable, and if the checks became blue, even if he didn’t reply, she knew that he still thought about her. Dana missed everything about him, but most of all, she became obsessed with the sex that she’d had with him. During this period, Dana spoke with her so often about the size of the boyfriend’s anatomy that at a certain point, after many weeks and months, she finally had to tell Dana that she could no longer hear about it. Though she understood that it had become a sort of stand-in for many other things that Dana wanted or needed, all the same she had trouble relating to Dana’s obsession, because, in her experience, an enormous penis wasn’t always the most comfortable sort to have inside you, especially when one had a fine penis at home already, one that had been enjoyed for 23 years, belonging to a man with whom one had gone through so much and still loved. To this, Dana replied that what had looked like happiness had, in the light of fresh experience, turned out not to be happiness after all, but something she’d told herself was happiness because she hadn’t known better. But we very rarely can know better, she pointed out to Dana; we simply know something different, since our memories of the past must always adjust to keep our stories coherent. A point with which Dana agreed, but was helpless to employ. It was around the time that a ban was placed on the discussion of the penis that, during one of the many terrible fights that Rafi and Dana had, Dana let something about it slip. She said it, and once she did, there was no way to take it back. After that, according to Dana, the fights became more violent, and for the first time in their long relationship, the illusion of equality began to break down. Money, which Rafi earned and Dana did not, moved from being something that simply made it possible for them to live to being a source of power, since now Rafi lost no opportunity to remind her that she was dependent on him, that he was the one working a job all day while she was at home trying to write her play. In time, Dana came to feel that the experiment of opening their relationship had only brought pain and confusion, that whatever growing they had done had only brought misery. On the one hand, during the many conversations she had with Rafi during that time, he never mentioned anatomy, violence, or money. What he said was that for as long as he could remember in his relationship with Dana, he had been the one who gave more, who gave most willingly and easily, and that he had grown tired of it. That what he wanted was for the exchange between them to be more equal. And yet although he spoke of wanting an equality of giving and receiving, he never gave up on speaking about wanting freedom, though the first concerned how one was treated and valued by another inside a system of relationship that involved compromises and limitations, and the other concerned the destruction or transcendence of that system, of going beyond it to that no-man’s-land where one stood utterly undefended, with nothing that one has promised and nothing that has been promised to one, but with a bright, clear view that goes on and on, all the way to the horizon. My boys are in the back seat, exhausted by the heat and the day-long sun, leaning their heads back and staring with glassy eyes at the passing sea, and either they are driving away from freedom, or toward it. After the difficult months of my undoing—months during which they watched over me with worried eyes, wanting to know how I’d slept, how I was feeling, not wanting to leave me, wanting to know whether my struggle would ever pass—they have been restored to their carefree state: midsummer, joyous, watched over. My store of knowledge about them seems to me the closest I’ve ever come to possessing something infinite, and only a small part of it can find a foothold in language. And that’s part of what is asked of us, isn’t it? To be a witness, to be able to recount our children’s stories from the very beginning? Exactly when and where they were conceived, how the older favored the right side of the womb and showed little interest in the left and punched against my belly skin from the inside with a knee or fist; how the younger came into the world with a furrowed, philosophical look, a slight skepticism almost, but a willingness to be convinced, and a downy fur on his shoulders that later fell out. I’ve told them the stories of their births many times, but at some point something shifted; they began to insist on making me the hero of these tales, rather than them. Now what they want to hear is how hard I needed to work to push them out, how I refused any pain medication because I wanted to be able to stand and walk and writhe however necessary to help them through the birth passage. They want to hear, again, how great the pain was that I had prevailed over—can I describe it? To what can it be compared? What they like, it seems to me, is to hear what an act of terrible strength it took to push them into the world, and that I, their mother, was capable of it. Or maybe what they want is to celebrate, again, the old and fading order of things, where they are not called on to protect, but are themselves watched over and protected. Enormous at birth, both are now so slender that their rib cages are visible under their skin when they lift their shirts over their heads. I know everything about what is visible of their bone structure beneath the skin, and about the skin itself, the precise location of each beauty mark and when it arrived, and the scars and what caused them; I know in what direction the hair on their heads grows, and the way they smell at night and in the morning, and all the many faces they went through before the ones they each wear now. Naturally I do. When the older one worries that he is too thin and weak, I tell him how my brother had been built the same way when he was young, until—without warning, like a storm come so suddenly that someone, somewhere, must have prayed for it—a change came over him. That the thinness is in their genes, the sticks for arms and narrow waist and ribs poking out, all of it written into their bodies like an ancient story, but that sooner or later the time will come when this smallness and thinness will be overwritten, subsumed by mass, and the boys they are now will disappear, buried inside the men they will become. Your brother? he asks, trying to imagine it. My brother who he once, but only once, saw, in a moment of fury he failed to contain, push me across the room and threaten me with a fist. The small one is still too young to long to fall in love. He is surrounded by love, and that is still enough for him. The older one has already begun to long for it, but his body hasn’t yet caught up with him. About this, he can still joke with me. For now, desire and the workings of the body are still subjects for humor, but as the months pass, something has begun to loom behind it, larger and larger. He is waiting for the changes he sees overtaking his friends and worries they will never come to him, that he will never desire the way the others do. It’s like a switch, friends who have boys tell me: One day it is flipped, and after that things are never the same; the door closes on one side and opens to another, and that’s that. Another friend, a man, says that he had been a quiet reader all through childhood, and then between one month and the next he began to throw chairs. This worries the older one, too: the possibility that he will no longer be who he has always been, that he will lose something of his sensitivity, so valued by everyone who loves him, that he will become capable of violence. When I go to kiss him goodnight, he curls his body into mine and in a nervous voice tells me that he wants to remain a child, that he doesn’t want anything to change. But already he is no longer a child. He is standing out on a bank between the shore and a sea that goes on and on, and the water, as they say, is rising.

        "story": "Maybe if there had been someone willing and able to hold him completely, so that his gift left him altogether, he would have accepted the loss for the sake of the connection and made the adjustments necessary for living the way most people do, but in the early days, even at his weakest, he was always capable of a little stuttered jump in which he could recognize the bud of a flight, even if it didn’t take him off the ground for more than a few moments. And when no one was looking, it was sometimes capable of taking him farther and higher. He learned while still very young that he couldn’t rely on the gift, but when it failed, it always came back to him, like Samson’s long hair. So he was never able to think of himself as similar to other people, as sharing their predicament—he was never able to be one of them—and he couldn’t help but regard them, and their ideas of safety, with a certain amount of scorn. “I will go home”: The feeling that summoned the flights had some of that character. “I will be who I have always been.” And some of that. “I will know myself a child of God.” And also some of that. He kept the gift to himself because he guessed that most people who learned about it would hate him. Their instinct, if they saw him fluttering along a wall like a moth trapped indoors, would be to crush him rather than to open a window. He felt scorn for them on account of this probable cruelty, too. He couldn’t believe in the justice of punishments that would be easy for him to escape from. There was no trick. It was just something he could do, if he concentrated. That was the whole mechanism: concentrating and letting go at the same time. It came more easily to him in some places than others: in the ruins of a barn, under certain trees. Growing up in the countryside had probably helped him discover that he was capable of it. Even when he was little, he had often been left on his own outdoors. The gift had almost no practical use, despite what someone unfamiliar with it might expect. It made a couple of venal things easier, like spying and stealing, but they had to be kept hidden, like the gift itself, and therefore couldn’t really be enjoyed. Still, even though it brought him little to no benefit, it made him lazy by preserving in him an unearned confidence that almost everyone else had to surrender on the way to adulthood. For him, getting away was always easy, and this weakened him. People never looked up when you left, he learned early on; up never occurred to them. One moment you were being reprimanded, and the next moment you were looking at the scene of the reprimand, receding below you, as it continued in your absence. It was bad for one’s morals never to have to either give in to such a situation or gather your resources to challenge it. Sometimes, aware of how far he was drifting from the kind of person he was supposed to become, he tried to make himself give in as an effort of will, but the life he had been born into, the one he had so much trouble keeping himself stuck in, wasn’t easy, and one definition of suffering is that it is more than one can take. Despite his best intentions, when he reached that point, he left, naturally. He watched the ground that his feet had been resting on pull away. “Samuel!” his mother shouted. “Samuel!” It was always quieter; the falling-away was always peaceful. Was it a little like death? There the world goes, he thought. So that’s how the rooms of the house fit together. He never signaled beforehand that he was leaving, partly because he was never sure ahead of time that he was going to be able to. Through accommodating his personality to the gift and its intermittent nature, he developed, instead of a morally responsible character, a deep respect for luck. To challenge himself, the way the effort to be virtuous challenges ordinary people, he came up with a rule: He decided that it would be vulgar to presume on his luck, which was, for the most part, like a god’s. Even though he liked his teachers and they liked him, he didn’t finish school, probably because of his gift. He couldn’t get himself to believe that he needed to know what they were teaching. After he called it quits, his mother’s understandable frustration with him reached such a pitch that he moved out. He took a job in town washing dishes in a diner and rented a room in a group apartment at the bad end of the main street. When he walked back to the apartment, at the end of a night shift, his fingers thick, he waited until he was in the shadow between two streetlights before he let himself be lifted up. Now that he was an adult, whenever it happened he mostly just felt sorry for other people that they didn’t have anything like it in their life, but not sorry enough to stop. What they didn’t know they were missing perhaps didn’t hurt them. Above the hoods of the streetlights, the spray of stars in the sky was visible in a finer grain. One day, while he was eating lunch at the end of the counter, a god sat down on the stool next to him. His skin was colorless. He looked only a few years older than Samuel. He was a god of destruction, he told Samuel in so many words. “But I can’t destroy someone like you,” the god said. “You can only be killed once you’ve lost your gift.” “But I never know if I still have it until it happens again.” “Shall I try to kill you, and see?” “Not today,” Samuel laughed. And his gift pulled him away, above the counter and the fry grill, and he pedaled the air to stay in place and found that he was rotating slowly, against his will. He was being turned by the effort he was making to keep from passing along the tin ceiling and slipping like smoke out the transom window above the diner’s front door. The god took a sip of his coffee and looked up at Samuel. Samuel saw that he wouldn’t be able to hold his own unless he challenged himself with a new rule, to secure his dignity: never presume on or trade on acquaintanceship with a god, which was, after all, also a matter of luck. And never pretend not to know that a gift gives one the right of equal conversation with a god. The two arranged to meet that night on the steps of the town’s white church. After his shift, Samuel ran home to shower off his dishwasher’s coating of sweat and grease. When he reached the green, the god spotted him and came down the church steps. “Take me with you,” the god ordered. “I don’t think I can,” Samuel said, but when he put an arm around the waist of the god, who stepped onto one of his feet, they rose. Carrying someone made Samuel dizzy. Maybe he was dizzy because being accompanied caused him to retain enough of his everyday social self to remember that it was only human to be afraid of being high above the ground, unsupported. Or maybe he was unnerved by having to be careful not to let go; for once, a flight of his involved a responsibility. At the foot of the green stood three white pines. Samuel landed himself and the god on a branch near the top of the middle one. He put the god down where the branch met the tree and placed himself farther out, so that when he reached toward the trunk for balance, the god’s warm torso pressed against his arm. From this height he could perceive that the circles thrown by the lights below had different tints—skim milk, beer, apple juice. On the ground, one stood too much inside the lights to distinguish between them. “Shall I kill you now?” the god asked, and jumped. Samuel jumped after him, feeling responsible. The stinging pin-feathers of the tree battered his face as he fell, but he kept his eyes on the god’s eyes, the god upright and himself head down. Before they hit the ground, the god reached out and erased the tree and erased the town and took Samuel’s hands. When the god restored the town, he and Samuel were standing on the green again, and the god disentangled his fingers from Samuel’s with a gesture almost of throwing Samuel’s away. For weeks, every night after work, Samuel returned to the church steps. Sometimes he let himself wait on the steeple—he stood on the rim where the steeple’s white pyramid rested on its white plinth. The choice of setting was a little dramatic and self-pitying, he knew. Only someone under a curse like his would wait in such a place. The plinth was wood, but the pyramid wasn’t. Instead, the pyramid was a light-colored metal, which quavered if you rapped it. There was enough light pollution that even from this height Samuel had a view, in barely colorized silhouette, of almost the whole town. For the first time he felt a surge of ambition; he wanted to be able to do something to compel the god to notice him. Call the god down again. Otherwise the rest of his youth might pass away before it occurred to the god to revisit him. He should have thought of ambition sooner, though; he was already on a different path. On some nights, in an invisible exhibition, he rose as high as he could, until the horizon started to bend away and the steeple below him dwindled to a white caltrop. The emotionalism of such a trajectory was a bad habit, he sensed, but since the feat was something only he could do, perhaps there wasn’t a standard by which it could be judged. A woman Samuel’s age started at the diner as a waitress. She had freckles and, on her left cheek, a scar. When business was slow she opened the emergency exit, despite a warning on it that an alarm would sound, and smoked a cigarette, the cigarette outside the diner and herself inside. “Do you want to get high?” she asked one night when they were closing. “Here?” “Why not?” She unscrolled the rattling security grill to block the front door, and they sat in one of the booths. She took out of her purse something that looked like a kazoo but that she said was a pipe, and she unpuckered the Ziploc top of a clear-plastic baggie and sprinkled into the kazoo what looked like broken rock sugar. “Kiss me,” she said, after she had taken a hit but before she had shared the kazoo with Samuel. “I think I’m into guys,” he cautioned her. “Me too,” she replied. “I just want to remember.” She explained that her first boyfriend had broken a bottle in her face, five years ago—that was the scar—and that she didn’t have any feeling anymore in the left side of her lower lip. “But I don’t usually notice,” she said. “It’s called ‘filling in,’ when you think you feel something you can’t feel.” She took another ball of smoke into her mouth and he kissed her as a way of taking it from her, and the high was so much better than anything he had ever been able to do for himself or anyone else had ever done for him that for the next 17 years he forgot about what he had been able to do. He was living on a different coast when he remembered. His hair was gray, which might not have been from using, but sometimes when he got high, his body went out on him like a spotty cellphone signal, and that probably was from using. He had been put in a house. The time had come for him to either give up on getting high or give up on trying not to, and while he was struggling with the choice, it came back to him that once upon a time, there had been a similar choice that he had always been able to get out of. That was how he returned to the memory. At first it was like remembering having had an imaginary friend without being able to remember the friend. But after a while, as he remembered a little more, he started to wonder how much the gift had been to blame. Maybe the irresponsibility fostered by the gift had been the point of vulnerability in him. The point where his armor had been pierced. Or had the gift been a strength that using had alienated him from? A drug, after all, helped one fit in with the world. Using wasn’t a matter of grace. Anyone could use, even if not everyone did. And once used, a drug was gone; in that way, it was one of the most routine pleasures in the world. He saw that over the years he had transferred to the drug much of the secret pride he had once taken in his gift. He had even taught himself to look down a little on his former woolly-mindedness—on his lost willingness to depend on a pleasure that had been not only anomalous, but unreliable. He had grown up. It was unlikely that he could reverse the process. But even if he could, even if he were able to recover his naive faith, it might be stupid, at this late date—it might sabotage any hoped-for recovery—if he reminded himself, in a feeling way, that for him getting out of being in the world had always been the subtlest pleasure to be found in it. One morning he signed out of the house and took a bus south of the city to a beach he liked that the authorities had closed, or had tried to close, anyway. At one end it rose to an escarpment high above the water, erratically undermined in the past few years by erosion, which was why the beach was supposed to be closed and also a large part of the romance of it. He was hungry by the time he got there; he had forgotten to plan for lunch. It was the rainy part of the year. He zipped up his fleece against the drizzle and hid himself in his hood. His fingers were stiff from dozing on the bus and he was tired, because all these years later he was still working night shifts. As part of getting sober he was staying away from work in bars and restaurants, and instead was doing a kind of data entry, reading business documents for a law firm and attaching tags and other metadata so that attorneys assigned to a case could search them more effectively. Nothing about the job naturally held his attention, but he had trained himself to find a groove and roll along in it. Rivalrous waves flattened themselves at his feet and subsided, fizzing, into the sand, darkening and smoothing an area whose upper border had the shape left by wipers at the top of the windshield. There was getting high with other people and there was getting high alone, and he had always preferred alone. He remembered the god who had made him feel left alone. What a ridiculous story! They hadn’t even gone to bed together. Had anything really happened? Ahead, where the escarpment rose, he saw that the tip of a sort of promontory had broken off and was held in place by a mesquite tree’s roots, which had grown through the tip while the tip and promontory had still been attached and which in their far extremities still held on to the yellow clay of the promontory. The trunk of the tree was pointing not quite straight down. Toward about 7 o’clock. He tried to imagine himself rising up the incline to the tree. He even closed his eyes. Nothing raised him. Of course, he had spent the past 17 years training himself with reward and deprivation, so no wonder he had succeeded in establishing at least a habit of conforming. He continued walking. It was still a nice day for the beach, in a somewhat desolate way. Maybe the underlying memory was of an experience that he’d had as a child and misunderstood at the time, such as being picked up by a parent or grandparent. Or maybe it was a species memory of something like swinging in trees when we were monkeys. Or it could just be a memory of the feeling of swimming. He had always liked swimming. Once when he had been younger and full of his own vigor as well as high, he had stripped and waded into a cold sea and, almost just for the symbolism of it, with great effort jacked himself off, the cold of the water working unsuccessfully against the heat in him. He had proved something, at least at that moment, for that moment. He almost certainly couldn’t do that now. He could still go for a swim, though, for the sake of whatever symbolism remained in that, or just for the experience. This was a colder month, but a warmer ocean. There was a breeze, and the water, a sour green, was just flicking into whitecaps, but a slightly high sea was a clean kind of danger, and because he couldn’t remember his blackouts, he liked to say that nothing really bad had ever really happened to him. He folded his clothes as he took them off. The trick was to get far enough out quickly enough to put all of himself under before his feet and ankles got so cold that he gave up. He raked his legs through the water until he was up to his waist and then fell forward. He saw little spikes of white under his closed eyelids as his body recalibrated to the temperature, and then he felt the exhilaration of surviving the pain and moving in it and, for the moment, mastering it. He turned to float on his back, frog-kicking himself away from shore. Waves were breaking violently against the rocks at the foot of the escarpment, and he needed to keep away from them. He had to make sure, too, that his muscles and his blood kept moving so that he didn’t get a cramp, which would be dangerous alone in choppy water. This wasn’t what he remembered, but maybe this had gone into it. This moving in a medium that was itself moving. Another possibility was that the underlying memory was just walking, which must feel like an uncertain miracle when a child first manages it. He flipped over and ducked under and pulled himself down and forward. A cold line rolled across his body as he sank into a deeper, colder stratum. He came up to the surface just in time for a wave to slap him in the face, and he sputtered a little. He told himself to take the sea’s violence playfully. He was naked, after all. Its violence was the sportiveness of a great creature, like a bear or a lion, capable of killing him without meaning to. He was too old for this, but it was exciting. What if someone came up the beach and stole his clothes? He turned around to look for them, treading water as he did so. After a moment he found them, farther to the right than he remembered them being, which meant he had been carried to the left. A wave surged from behind and lifted him. Suddenly a torque inside the wave swiveled his legs as if they were inside dough that was being kneaded. I’ve never felt this before, he thought as he was pulled under. A sensation of being overpowered and not wanting it. Of being moved in a medium in which he couldn’t will himself to move. An ant in cooling amber. Everyone is always on a path that leads to death. But I don’t want to die yet, he thought. I have to get to shore was the sharp side of what he was feeling. But there was also a duller, slower side: So that’s how the rooms of the house fit together.  By the time the torque relaxed, his legs had gone so rubbery that they wobbled around under him without getting any purchase in the water. He dog-paddled, lacking the strength of mind necessary to organize his movements. A current was still trying to pull him away and down the shore, but the force in his arms was probably going to be enough to counter it. If he made it, he was going to have to walk a bit to get back to his clothes. It was raining in earnest now, pitting the surface of the water around him. His clothes were going to be wet, or anyway the T-shirt on top was going to be. He was able to see the little smudge that was the stack of them, waiting for him, now even farther to the right than they had been before. If he came ashore on the rocks, he was going to have to be careful not to cut up his feet and shins or topple and hit his head. He wanted to be able to try to fly one more time, even if it was too late."

        "year": "2020",
        "story": "Whenever I think of my mother, I picture a queen-size bed with her lying in it, a practiced stillness filling the room. For months on end, she colonized that bed like a virus, the first time when I was a child and then again when I was a graduate student. The first time, I was sent to Ghana to wait her out. While there, I was walking through Kejetia Market with my aunt when she grabbed my arm and pointed. “Look, a crazy person,” my aunt said in Twi. “Do you see? A crazy person.” I was mortified. My aunt was speaking loudly, and the man, tall with dust caked into his dreadlocks, was within earshot. “I see, I see,” I answered in a low hiss. The man continued past us, mumbling to himself as he waved his hands about in gestures that only he could understand. My aunt nodded, satisfied, and we kept walking through the hordes of people gathered in the market until we reached the stall where we would spend the rest of the morning attempting to sell knockoff handbags. In my three months there, we sold only four bags. Even now, I don’t completely understand why my aunt singled the man out to me. Maybe she thought there were no crazy people in America, that I had never seen one before. Or maybe she was thinking about my mother, about the real reason I was stuck in Ghana that summer, sweating in a stall with an aunt I hardly knew while my mother healed at home in Alabama. I was 11, and I could see that my mother wasn’t sick, not in the ways that I was used to. I didn’t understand what my mother needed healing from. I didn’t understand, but I did. And my embarrassment at my aunt’s loud gesture had as much to do with my understanding as it did with the man who had passed us by. My aunt was saying, That. That is what crazy looks like. But instead what I heard was my mother’s name. What I saw was my mother’s face, still as lake water, Pastor John’s hand resting gently on her forehead, his prayer a light hum that made the room buzz. I’m not sure I know what crazy looks like, but even today when I hear the word, I picture a split screen, the dreadlocked man in Kejetia on one side, my mother lying in bed on the other. I think about how no one at all reacted to that man in the market, not in fear or disgust, nothing, save my aunt, who wanted me to look. He was, it seemed to me, at perfect peace, even as he gesticulated wildly, even as he mumbled. But my mother, in her bed, infinitely still, was wild inside. The second time it happened, I got a phone call while I was working in my lab at Stanford. I’d had to separate two of my mice because they were ripping each other to bits in that shoebox of a home we kept them in. I found a piece of flesh in one corner of the box, but I couldn’t tell which mouse it had come from. Both were bleeding and frenzied, scurrying away from me when I tried to grab them even though there was nowhere to run. “Look, Gifty, she hasn’t been to church in nearly a month,” Pastor John said to me. “I’ve been calling the house, but she won’t pick up. I go by sometimes and make sure she’s got food and everything, but I think—I think it’s happening again.” I didn’t say anything. The mice had calmed down considerably, but I was still shaken by the sight of them and worried about my research. Worried about everything. “Gifty?” Pastor John said. “She should come stay with me.” I’m not sure how the pastor got my mother on the plane, because when I picked her up at SFO she looked completely vacant, her body limp. I imagined Pastor John folding her up the way you would a jumpsuit, arms crossed over the chest in an X, legs pulled up to meet them, then tucking her safely into a suitcase complete with a handle with care sticker before passing her off to a flight attendant. I gave her a stiff hug and she shrank from my touch. I took a deep breath. “Did you check a bag?” I asked. “Daabi,” she said. “No bags, great—we can go straight to the car.” The saccharine cheeriness of my voice annoyed me so much that I bit my tongue in an attempt to bite it back. I felt a prick of blood and sucked it away. She followed me to my Prius. Under better circumstances she would have made fun of my car, an oddity to her after years of Alabama pickup trucks and SUVs. “Gifty, my bleeding heart,” she sometimes called me. I don’t know where she’d picked up the phrase, but I figured it was probably used derogatorily by Pastor John and the various TV preachers she liked to watch to describe people who, like me, had defected from Alabama to live among the sinners of the world, presumably because the excessive bleeding of our hearts made us too weak to tough it out among the hardy, the chosen of Christ in the Bible Belt. She loved Billy Graham, who said things like “A real Christian is the one who can give his pet parrot to the town gossip.” Cruel, I thought when I was a child, to give away your pet parrot. The funny thing about the phrases that my mom picked up is that she always got them a little wrong. I was her bleeding heart, not a bleeding heart. It’s a crime shame, not a crying shame. She had a slight southern accent that tinted her Ghanaian one. In the car, my mother stared out of the passenger-side window. I tried to imagine the scenery the way she might be seeing it. When I’d first arrived in California, everything had looked so beautiful to me. Even the grass, yellowed, scorched from the sun and the seemingly endless drought, had looked otherworldly. This must be Mars, I thought, because how could this be America too? I pictured the drab green pastures of my childhood, the small hills we called mountains. The vastness of this western landscape overwhelmed me. I’d come to California because I wanted to get lost, to find. In college, I’d read Walden because a boy I found beautiful found the book beautiful. I understood nothing but highlighted everything, including this: “Not till we are lost, in other words, not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.” If my mother was moved by the landscape too, I couldn’t tell. We lurched forward in traffic and I caught the eye of the man in the car next to ours. He quickly looked away, then looked back, then away again. I wanted to make him uncomfortable, or maybe just to transfer my own discomfort to him, so I kept staring. I could see in the way that he gripped the steering wheel that he was trying not to look at me again. His knuckles were pale, veiny, rimmed with red. He gave up, shot me an exasperated look, mouthed, What? I’ve always found that traffic on a bridge brings everyone closer to their own personal edge. Inside each car, a snapshot of a breaking point, drivers looking out toward the water and wondering, What if? Could there be another way out? We scooted forward again. In the scrum of cars, the man seemed almost close enough to touch. What would he do if he could touch me? If he didn’t have to contain all of that rage inside his Honda Accord, where would it go? “Are you hungry?” I asked my mother, finally turning away. She shrugged, still staring out of the window. The last time this happened, she’d lost 70 pounds in two months. When I came back from my summer in Ghana, I hardly recognized her, this woman who had always found skinny people offensive, as though a kind of laziness or failure of character kept them from appreciating the pure joy that is a good meal. Then she joined their ranks. Her cheeks sank; her stomach deflated. She hollowed, disappeared. I was determined not to let that happen again. I’d bought a Ghanaian cookbook online to make up for the years I’d spent avoiding my mother’s kitchen, and I’d practiced a few of the dishes in the days leading up to my mother’s arrival, hoping to perfect them before I saw her. I’d bought a deep fryer, even though my grad-student stipend left little room in my budget for extravagances like bofrot or plantains. Fried food was my mother’s favorite. Her mother had made fried food in a cart on the side of the road in Kumasi. My grandmother was a Fante woman from Abandze, a sea town, and she was notorious for despising Asantes, so much so that she refused to speak Twi, even after 20 years of living in the Asante capital. If you bought her food, you had to listen to her language. “We’re here,” I said, rushing to help my mother get out of the car. She walked a little ahead of me, even though she’d never been to this apartment before. She’d visited me in California only a couple of times. “Sorry for the mess,” I said, but there was no mess. None that my eyes could see anyway, but my eyes were not hers. Every time she visited me over the years, she’d sweep her finger along things it never occurred to me to clean—the backs of the blinds, the hinges of doors—then present the dusty, blackened finger to me in accusation, and I could do nothing but shrug. “Cleanliness is godliness,” she used to say. “Cleanliness is next to godliness,” I would correct, and she would scowl at me. What was the difference? I pointed her toward the bedroom, and, silently, she crawled into bed and drifted off to sleep. As soon as I heard the sound of soft snoring, I snuck out of the apartment and went to check on my mice. Though I had separated them, the mouse with the largest wounds was hunched over from pain in the corner of the box. Watching him, I wasn’t sure he would live much longer. It filled me with an inexplicable sorrow, and when my lab mate, Han, found me 20 minutes later, crying in the corner of the room, I was too mortified to admit that the thought of a mouse’s death was the cause of my tears. “Bad date,” I told Han. A look of horror passed over his face as he mustered up a few pitiful words of comfort, and I could imagine what he was thinking: I went into the hard sciences so that I wouldn’t have to be around emotional women. My crying turned to laughter, loud and phlegmy, and the look of horror on his face deepened until his ears flushed as red as a stop sign. I stopped laughing and rushed out of the lab and into the restroom, where I stared at myself in the mirror. My eyes were puffy and red; my nose looked bruised, the skin around the nostrils dry and scaly from the tissues. “Get ahold of yourself,” I said to the woman in the mirror, but doing so felt cliché, like I was reenacting a scene from a movie, and so I started to feel like I didn’t have a self to get ahold of, or rather that I had a million selves, too many to gather. One was in the bathroom; another, in the lab staring at my wounded mouse, an animal about whom I felt nothing at all, yet whose pain had reduced me somehow. Or multiplied me. Another self was thinking about my mother. When I returned to the lab, Han looked up from his work. “Hey,” he said. “Hey.” Though we’d been sharing the space for months, we hardly ever said more than this to each other, except for today, when he’d found me crying. Han’s ears usually burned bright red if I tried to push our conversation past that initial greeting. I drove back to my apartment. In the bedroom, my mother still lay underneath a cloud of covers. A purr floated out from her lips. I’d been living alone for so long that even that soft noise, hardly more than a hum, unnerved me. I’d forgotten what it was like to live with my mother, to care for her. For a long time, most of my life, in fact, it had been just me and her, but this pairing was unnatural. She knew it and I knew it, and we both tried to ignore what we knew to be true—there used to be four of us, then three, two. When my mother goes, whether by choice or not, there will be only one. When there were four of us, I was too young to appreciate it. My mother used to tell stories about my father. At 6 feet 4 inches, he was the tallest man she’d ever seen; she thought he was maybe even the tallest man in all of Kumasi. He used to hang around her mother’s food stand, joking with my grandmother about her stubborn Fante, coaxing her into giving him a free baggie of achomo, which he called chin chin like the Nigerians in town did. My mother was 30 when they met, 31 when they married. She was already an old maid by Ghanaian standards, but she said God had told her to wait, and when she met my father, she knew what she’d been waiting for. She called him the Chin Chin Man, like her mother called him. And when I was very little and wanted to hear stories about him, I’d tap my chin until my mother complied. “Tell me about Chin Chin,” I’d say. I almost never thought of him as my father. The Chin Chin Man was six years older than she was. Coddled by his own mother, he’d felt no need to marry. He had been raised Catholic, but once my mother got ahold of him, she dragged him to the Christ of her Pentecostal church. The same church where the two of them were married in the sweltering heat, with so many guests that they stopped counting after 200. They prayed for a baby, but month after month, year after year, no baby came. It was the first time my mother ever doubted God. After I am worn out, and my Lord is old, shall I have pleasure? “You can have a child with someone else,” she offered, taking initiative in God’s silence, but the Chin Chin Man laughed at the suggestion. My mother spent three days fasting and praying in the living room of my grandmother’s house. She must have looked as frightful as a witch, smelled as horrid as a stray dog, but when she left her prayer room, she said to my father, “Now,” and he went to her and they lay together. Nine months to the day later, my brother, Nana, my mother’s Isaac, was born. My mother used to say, “You should have seen the way the Chin Chin Man smiled at Nana.” His entire face was in on it. His eyes brightened; his lips spread back until they were touching his ears, which lifted. Nana’s face returned the compliment, smiling in kind. My father’s heart was a light bulb, dimming with age. Nana was pure light. Nana could walk at seven months. That’s how they knew he would be tall. He was the darling of their compound. Neighbors used to request him at parties. “Would you bring Nana by?” they’d say, wanting to fill their apartment with his smile, his bowlegged baby dancing. Every street vendor had a gift for Nana: a bag of koko, an ear of corn, a tiny drum. “What couldn’t he have?” my mother wondered. Why not the whole world? She knew the Chin Chin Man agreed. Nana, beloved and loving, deserved the best. But what was the best that the world had to offer? For the Chin Chin Man, it was my grandmother’s achomo, the bustle of Kejetia, the red clay, his mother’s fufu pounded just so. It was Kumasi, Ghana. My mother was less certain of this. She had a cousin in America who sent money and clothes back to the family somewhat regularly, which surely meant there were money and clothes in abundance across the Atlantic. With Nana’s birth, Ghana had started to feel too cramped. My mother wanted room for him to grow. They argued and argued and argued, but the Chin Chin Man’s easygoing nature meant he let my mother go easy, and so after a week of arguing she applied for the green-card lottery. It was a time when not many Ghanaians were immigrating to America, which is to say you could enter the lottery and win. My mother found out that she had been randomly selected for permanent residency in America a few months later. She packed what little she owned, bundled up baby Nana, and moved to Alabama, a state she had never heard of, but where she planned to stay with her cousin, who was finishing up her Ph.D. The Chin Chin Man would follow later, after they had saved up enough money for a second plane ticket and a home of their own. My mother slept all day and all night, every day, every night. She was immovable. Whenever I could, I would try to persuade her to eat something. I’d taken to making koko, my favorite childhood meal. I’d had to go to three different stores to find the right kind of millet, the right kind of corn husks, the right peanuts to sprinkle on top. I hoped the porridge would go down easily. I’d leave a bowl of it by her bedside in the morning before I went to work, and when I returned the top layer would be covered in film; the layer underneath had hardened so that when I scraped it into the sink, I felt the effort of it. My mother’s back was always turned to me. It was like she had an internal sensor for when I’d be entering the room to deliver the koko. I could picture the movie montage of us, the days spelled out at the bottom of the screen, my outfits changing, our actions the same. After about five days of this, I entered the room and my mother was awake and facing me. “Gifty,” she said as I set the bowl of koko down. “Do you still pray?” It would have been kinder to lie, but I wasn’t kind anymore. Maybe I never had been. I vaguely remembered a childhood kindness, but maybe I was conflating innocence and kindness. I felt so little continuity between who I was as a young child and who I was now that it seemed pointless to even consider showing my mother something like mercy. Would I have been merciful when I was a child? “No,” I answered. When I was a child, I prayed. I studied my Bible and kept a journal with letters to God. I was a paranoid journal keeper, so I made code names for all the people in my life I wanted God to punish. Reading the journal makes it clear that I was a real “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” kind of Christian, and that I believed in the redemptive power of punishment. For it is said, that when that due Time, or appointed Time comes, their Foot shall slide. Then they shall be left to fall as they are inclined by their own Weight. The code name I gave my mother was the Black Mamba, because we’d just learned about the snake in school. The movie the teacher showed us that day featured a seven-foot-long snake that looked like a slender woman in a skintight leather dress, slithering across the Sahara in pursuit of a bush squirrel. In my journal, the night we learned about the snake, I wrote: Dear God, The Black Mamba has been really mean to me lately. Yesterday she told me that if I didn’t clean my room no one would want to marry me. My brother, Nana, was code-named Buzz. I don’t remember why now. In the first few years of my journal-keeping, Buzz was my hero: Dear God, Buzz ran after the ice-cream truck today. He bought a firecracker popsicle for himself and a Flintstones push pop for me. Or: Dear God, At the rec center today, none of the other kids wanted to be my partner for the three-legged race because they said I was too little, but then Buzz came over and he said that he would do it! And guess what? We won and I got a trophy. Sometimes he annoyed me, but back then, his offenses were innocuous, trivial. Dear God, Buzz keeps coming into my room without knocking! I can’t stand him! But after a few years, my pleas for God’s intervention became something else entirely. Dear God, When Buzz came home last night he started yelling at TBM and I could hear her crying, so I went downstairs to look even though I was supposed to be in bed. (I’m sorry.) She told him to keep quiet or he would wake me, but then he picked up the TV and smashed it on the floor and punched a hole in the wall and his hand was bleeding and TBM started crying and she looked up and saw me and I ran back to my room while Buzz screamed get the fuck out of here you nosy cunt. (What is a cunt?) I was 10 when I wrote that entry. I was smart enough to use the code names and make note of new vocabulary words but not smart enough to see that anyone who could read could easily crack my code. I hid the journal under my mattress, but because my mother is a person who thinks to clean underneath a mattress, I’m sure she must have found it at some point. If she did, she never mentioned it. After the broken-television incident, my mother had run up to my bedroom and locked the door while Nana raved downstairs. She grabbed me close and pulled the both of us down onto our knees behind the bed while she prayed in Twi. Awurade, bɔ me ba barima ho ban. Awurade, bɔ me ba barima ho ban. Lord, protect my son. Lord, protect my son. “You should pray,” my mother said then, reaching for the koko. I watched her eat two spoonfuls before setting it back down on the nightstand. “Is it okay?” I asked. She shrugged, turned her back to me once more. I went to the lab. Han wasn’t there, so he hadn’t turned the thermostat down low as he usually did. I set my jacket on the back of a chair, got myself ready, then grabbed a couple of my mice to anesthetize and prep them for surgery. I shaved the fur from the tops of their heads until I saw their scalps. I carefully drilled into those, wiping the blood away, until I found the bright red of their brains, the chests of the rodents expanding and deflating mechanically as they breathed their unconscious breaths. Though I had done this millions of times, it still awed me to see a brain. To know that if I could understand this little organ inside this one tiny mouse, that understanding still wouldn’t speak to the full intricacy of the comparable organ inside my own head. And yet I had to try to understand and to extrapolate to those of us who made up the species Homo sapiens, the most complex animal, the only animal who believed he had transcended his kingdom, as one of my high-school biology teachers used to say. That belief, that transcendence, was held within this organ itself. Infinite, unknowable, soulful, perhaps even magical. I had traded the Pentecostalism of my childhood for this new religion, this new quest, knowing that I would never fully know. I was a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience at the Stanford University School of Medicine. My research was on the neural circuits of reward-seeking behavior. Once, on a date during my first year of grad school, I had bored a guy stiff by trying to explain to him what I did all day. He’d taken me to Tofu House in Palo Alto, and as I watched him struggle with his chopsticks, losing several pieces of bulgogi to the napkin in his lap, I’d told him all about the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. “We know that the medial prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in suppressing reward-seeking behavior; it’s just that the neural circuitry that allows it to do so is poorly understood.” I’d met him on OkCupid. He had straw-blond hair, skin perpetually at the end phase of a sunburn. He looked like a SoCal surfer. The entire time we’d messaged back and forth, I’d wondered if I was the first Black girl he’d ever asked out, if he was checking some kind of box off his list of new and exotic things he’d like to try, like the Korean food in front of us, which he had already given up on. “Huh,” he said. “Sounds interesting.” Maybe he’d expected something different. There were only five women in my lab of 28, and I was one of three Black Ph.D. candidates in the entire med school. He never called me back. From then on, I told dates that my job was to get mice hooked on cocaine before taking it away from them. Two in three asked the same question: “So do you just, like, have a ton of cocaine?” I never admitted that we’d switched from cocaine to Ensure. It was easier to get and sufficiently addictive for the mice. I relished the thrill of having something interesting and illicit to say to these men, most of whom I would sleep with once and then never see again. It made me feel powerful to see their names flash across my phone screen hours, days, weeks after they’d seen me naked, after they’d dug their fingernails into my back, sometimes drawing blood. Reading their texts, I liked to feel the marks they’d left. I felt like I could suspend the men there, just names on my phone screen, but after a while, they stopped calling, moved on, and then I would feel powerful in their silence. At least for a little while. I wasn’t accustomed to power in relationships, power in sexuality. I had never been asked on a date in high school. Not once. I wasn’t cool enough, white enough, enough. In college, I had been shy and awkward, still molting the skin of a Christianity that insisted I save myself for marriage, that left me fearful of men and of my body. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. I watched my mice groggily spring back to life, recovering from the anesthesia and woozy from the painkillers I’d given them. I’d injected a virus into the nucleus accumbens and implanted a lens in their brain so that I could see their neurons firing as I ran my experiments. I sometimes wondered if they noticed the added weight they carried on their heads, but I tried not to think thoughts like that, tried not to humanize them, because I worried that would make doing my work harder. I cleaned up my station and went to my office to try to do some writing. I was supposed to be working on a paper, presumably my last before graduating. The most difficult part, putting the figures together, usually took me only a few weeks or so, but I had been dragging things out. Running my experiments over and over again, until the idea of stopping, of writing, of graduating, seemed impossible. I’d put a little warning on the wall above my desk to whip myself into shape: 20 minutes of writing a day or else. Or else what? I wondered. Anyone could see it was an empty threat. After 20 minutes of doodling, I pulled out the journal entry from years ago that I kept hidden in the bowels of my desk to read on those days when I was feeling low and lonely and useless and hopeless. Or when I wished I had a job that paid me more than a $17,000 stipend to stretch through a quarter in this expensive college town. Dear God, Buzz is going to prom and he has a suit on! It’s navy blue with a pink tie and a pink pocket square. TBM had to order the suit special cuz Buzz is so tall that they didn’t have anything for him in the store. We spent all afternoon taking pictures of him, and we were all laughing and hugging and TBM was crying and saying, “You’re so beautiful,” over and over. And the limo came to pick Buzz up so he could pick his date up and he stuck his head out of the sunroof and waved at us. He looked normal. Please, God, let him stay like this forever. My brother died of a heroin overdose three months later. “I’m pretty, right?” I once asked my mother. We were standing in front of the mirror while she put her makeup on for work. I don’t remember how old I was, only that I wasn’t allowed to wear makeup yet. I had to sneak it when my mother wasn’t around, but that wasn’t too hard to do. My mother worked all the time. She was never around. “What kind of question is that?” she asked. She grabbed my arm and jerked me toward the mirror. “Look,” she said, and at first I thought she was angry at me. I tried to look away, but every time my eyes fell, my mother would jerk me to attention once more. She jerked me so many times, I thought my arm would come loose from the socket. “Look at what God made. Look at what I made,” she said in Twi. We stared at ourselves in the mirror for a long time. We stared until my mother’s work alarm went off, the one that told her it was time to leave one job in order to get to the other. She finished putting her lipstick on, kissed her reflection in the mirror, and rushed off. I kept staring at myself after she left, kissing my own reflection.

        "story": "Evelyn hadn’t wanted to visit Helene. The women were no longer related, and it had been years since there was a reason for the performance of friendship and mutuality that had once existed between them. In this way, Tom and Ruth’s divorce had come as a relief. But there was shame, too, for Evelyn, an inner collapse when she admitted to herself that she had lived 22 years of her life with that woman shadowing her every thought and decision. Twenty-two years! To think that this could count as one of her most enduring relationships; neither of her marriages had lasted close to that long. And then, with one phone call—Mom, Tom and I have decided to split—the years of clench-jawed diplomacy with Helene simply vanished, as if they had never happened. Afterward, Evelyn took a small pleasure in ignoring Helene’s friends when she ran into them at the market or the nail salon, feeling absolutely no compunction to make nice, aware that these well-dressed busybodies would report back to Helene about Evelyn’s insistence on keeping her figure when the rest of them had settled into their battle-ready girths. But the truth was, Evelyn hadn’t been released from the woman at all. She avoided Weybridge Road on the off chance that Helene might be looking out her window at the exact moment Evelyn’s Buick passed and might think that, like a spurned lover, Evelyn was stalking her. When she dressed in the morning, she imagined Helene’s silent disapproval of a tight skirt or her bare legs. Evelyn had lately begun to spend her winters in Florida, which turned out to be a freedom, not only from the cold and heavy-lidded Ohio skies, but from the disapproving weather of that woman. But this business with Helene stashed away at Willowdale—well, it wasn’t right. Ruth, with dispassionate pragmatism—the effect, Evelyn supposed, of having been robbed of a father, a husband, and a daughter in one lifetime—said there wasn’t any point to visiting. “She doesn’t even recognize Tom anymore,” she’d explained when she called from New York. It was February then, and Evelyn was midway through her stay on Sanibel Island. Though it had been unsettling to know that Helene had taken such a bad turn that she could no longer be cared for in her home, it wasn’t until Evelyn returned to Cleveland in early May that the information truly sank in. The familiarity of her apartment on Van Aken was disheartening. Every piece of furniture, every picture on the wall, seemed to have been frozen during her absence, the three small rooms poorer for their attentive waiting. Evelyn felt stranded, and then she thought about Helene in Willowdale. “You shouldn’t bother yourself, Mom” was what Ruth had said. How many years had Evelyn been bothered on Helene’s account, arriving at her dinner parties an hour early to listen to her fuss over whether her housekeeper, Erna, would ruin the roast? How many times had she praised that overcooked and pretentious meat? Even in the ’70s, when people were lining up for gasoline and reacquainting themselves with liver and onions, Helene insisted on those charred hunks of beef encircled with puckered and feeble-looking potatoes that reminded Evelyn of the pearl chokers Helene wore so tightly, they pinched the loose skin at her neck. How many hours had she spent consoling Helene after the divorce—Helene, who behaved as if it were she who had been betrayed, even though it was Ruth who had suffered Tom’s many affairs? How often had she kept her mouth shut while she endured the insinuation that Francie’s troubles, first her irritableness, then the drugs, came from Evelyn’s side of the family, because Ruth’s father had drunk his way to a fatal car crash? It was awful to admit, but a few years earlier, when she’d first heard of Helene’s incipient dementia, she experienced—what was that German word? Even thinking of a German word she couldn’t remember gave her a little nip of glee, Helene having banned all things German from her life. The woman wouldn’t sit in a Volkswagen, for God’s sake. Of course, there was a time when Evelyn felt the same; most Jews she knew did. But you couldn’t hold it against the new generation. No one chooses whom they are born to. “She won’t know who you are, and one minute after you leave, she won’t remember you were there,” Ruth said, and at that precise moment, Evelyn knew what she would do. Willowdale was neither surrounded by willows nor nestled in a dale. It sat on a heavily trafficked street and looked like the nursery school that Francie had gone to. What was it called? Miss Brunner’s? The Brunner woman had painted her house red and called it a barn. She’d put a couple of dirty, undernourished goats and some chickens in her backyard and called it a farm. The woman dressed in overalls, for heaven’s sake. Ruth had been delighted by the idea of Francie spending time in a “rural” environment, as if cars were not shooting by on the street, causing the goats to shriek. For Evelyn, who had grown up on an actual farm in Nebraska, the whole thing was phony baloney, and if she remembered correctly, Francie had caught a bad case of fleas. As a matter of fact, she realized as she pulled into the driveway, it was the same place. The planter in the center of the roundabout that held impatiens, those unimaginative blooms of office parks, had replaced the flagpole and the sun-bleached flag that the children had raised and lowered every day, their little hands placed uncertainly over their chests as they stumbled through the Pledge, unsure where their hearts were. The nursery school had been turned into a nursing home, she thought with amusement as she parked the car. One babbling population exchanged for another. Helene probably wore diapers. Evelyn had been having a lot of these thoughts lately. Mean thoughts. Morbid thoughts. She’d see a man’s bloated face and imagine his heart attack. Or she’d watch a deer cross the road and picture it under the wheels of her car. It was necessary to think of the worst things, when the worst was so near at hand. She was 76. Reasonably healthy, but as the Floridians, those wrinkled prophets, reminded one another darkly: All it took was One Bad Fall. Cradle to grave. Nursery to nursing home. She wondered if Helene was aware of the irony. According to Ruth, she wasn’t aware of much. At any rate, she wouldn’t have found it funny. She had refused to set foot in that school after the flea incident. It was one more thing she blamed on Ruth, and by extension Evelyn. Well, it was Ruth’s fault, Evelyn supposed. The school had been a frivolous choice. It boasted a progressive curriculum that, as far as Evelyn could tell, taught children nothing except how to fling dirt at one another, write on their skin, and lick paint. Francie had begun kindergarten well behind the others. It was Evelyn who had made the girl sit on her hands when she did math sums in her head, to rid her of the habit of counting on her fingers. But, oh! Francie’s little hands! The dusty, bodily smell of them. So disgusting to think where they had been during the day, fingers digging in sandboxes and nostrils, heedlessly scratching a haphazardly wiped bottom. And yet, when Francie slept over, Evelyn could not help but give them a little sniff before making the girl submit to a good scrub with a nailbrush and then a session with the orange stick. She’d taught Francie about cuticle maintenance and that she must never wash her face with soap. And the girl had never suffered even a pimple in adolescence. Evelyn felt a shiver. She did not think of Francie all the time. But every so often she did. When she was in her late teens, and her experimentation had turned to addiction, Tom and Ruth did everything they could. By the time she was 25, and the marriage was over, they were at a loss. It’s her life, they said. A weak justification, Evelyn thought. Whose life was ever their own? Florida was supposed to help. A land of forgetting. People there gloried in reinvention, marveling at how they were suddenly able to leap around tennis courts or walk 18 holes without resorting to the cart. But Evelyn never forgot, not during viciously competitive rounds of canasta, not while she lay out in the sun, enjoying the scandal of her bikini. For a moment, she felt petulant about Helene’s vacant mind, imagining that, as with all things, the woman had imperiously commanded senility into being to avoid the cruelty of memory. Upon entering the lobby of the nursing home, Evelyn was relieved to see that the room that had once housed low tables, pint-size chairs, and cots for nap time had been turned into a pleasant lounge, where caramel-colored faux-leather couches were adult-size and stain-free. The young receptionist, who wore scrubs printed with a pattern of teddy bears, motioned her vaguely to one of the couches. She let Evelyn know that it might be a while; sometimes the clients, as she called them, had to be encouraged—she curled her fingers into air quotes—to greet visitors. Evelyn thought instantly of cattle prods. She couldn’t remember. Had Miss Brunner kept a cow? The problem with memories was that they were as willful as children: totally uncontrollable and always interrupting. You could not make a journey from here to there without abrupt cataclysms of recollection that sent your organs do-si-do-ing inside your body and that made you feel like you might be dying. Maybe it was all going to end right now, while she sat in a Naugahyde chair in a room perfumed by Comet and Windex with an undertone of decay. But there was also, incomprehensibly, the smell of the sea, and the sound of room-service carts clattering over a carpeted hallway. And there she was in that hotel room she and Helene had shared in the summer of 1975, when they’d gone with Tom and Ruth to meet Francie on the Mediterranean coast. The four of them arrived, after two flights and an uncomfortable car ride, only to find that the girl had left a message at the hotel saying that she wasn’t coming. She would meet them at Charles de Gaulle in a week for the flight home. Looking back, Evelyn supposed that was the start of things with Francie, although at the time they had all simply chalked it up to adolescent peevishness. What 16-year-old wanted to end her summer in France by having her family, grandmothers included, show up? Evelyn had thought it was a bad idea to begin with, and she tried to convince Ruth to let Francie travel home on her own. But when Tom got a notion into his head, he couldn’t be moved off it. Ideas galvanized him; the more irrational they were, the more he believed in their unassailable rightness, which made him a reasonably successful stockbroker and then a terribly failed one. Ruth, already burdened by the strain in her marriage, was in appeasement mode. It had been awful for Evelyn to witness her daughter’s panic, to see her try to fold herself into ever-smaller packages in an attempt to be so inconsequential that she would not cause a final rupture. Evelyn was not interested in the self-help many of her friends were newly dedicated to, discovering that illness was really a gift, death only a passage, but she would admit that a girl who had lost her father as young as Ruth had might have—what was it called?—abandonment issues. So there they were, the four of them, dumbfounded by the exhaustion of travel and embarrassed that their extravagant gesture of family unity, flying halfway across the world and checking into a hotel so expensive that Helene and Evelyn were to share a room, had been met with a shrug by the object of their thwarted affection. The fact that neither Tom nor Ruth seemed alarmed by their daughter’s decision was only testament to the fact that the marriage was coming apart at the seams. This new crisis was only one more thing. Helene and Evelyn settled into their room, while Tom and Ruth went off to make phone calls to the couple in Tours that Francie had lived with and the language school she had attended, in order to track her down. The room was a rococo folderol outfitted for romance. Luxurious curtains plunged to the floor like half-shed gowns. The wallpaper boasted a design of fat, nasty-looking cherubs. “What’s this?” Helene said to the porter, pointing to the room’s one queen-size bed as if the previous guest had defecated on it. “No, no, no! This is not possible.” “For God’s sake,” Evelyn said. “There’s nothing he can do about it.” She went into her purse and produced a dollar bill, which the boy examined as if it were a turned piece of fish. “The French,” Helene said, once the boy left. Afterward, she made a call to the front desk, but failed to secure a double room, a cot, or even an apology. Evelyn laid her purse on the side of the bed nearest the phone. She would be the first to receive any news of Francie when Tom and Ruth called. For the next 10 minutes, the women silently unpacked, taking turns hanging their clothing in the armoire. “What in the world?” Evelyn said with a light laugh, pointing to Helene’s open suitcase. She walked over to confirm that, indeed, a miniature American flag was anchored inside the upper lid of the case, the stars and stripes poking out of the silk pocket that was meant for delicates. “I am not ashamed to be an American,” Helene said. “We saved these people’s lives.” Suddenly, Evelyn felt overwhelmed by the intimacy of the room and the anticipation of the shared bed, and she announced that she was going to see the concierge about changing money. At lunch, Tom and Ruth reported that the phone calls had yielded nothing. Francie had bid her hosts goodbye two days prior. They knew nothing of the plan to meet her family in the south. “They made it seem like we were bothering them,” Ruth said. “What did you expect?” Tom said. “They are supposed to be her French family. That’s what the brochure said.” “That’s a little sentimental, even for you. They do it for the money.” Evelyn wanted to reach across the table and twist his earlobe. Or she wanted to slap her daughter on the cheek and tell her to do it herself. Their only hope of tracking down their daughter, Tom continued, was to wait until Francie ran out of money. “But that could take who knows how long!” Helene said, her voice rising. “Only if she doesn’t eat,” Tom said. “Tom read this book about Europe on five dollars a day,” Ruth said, a history of argument in her tone. “Which turns out to have been a very good idea,” Tom said. “She must be running out about now.” “So what do we do?” Helene said, alarmed by the vacation’s sudden lack of structure. “We wait,” Evelyn said. “Wait here?” Helene said, staring at her coquille St. Jacque as if she would have to take up residence in the shell. “Whatever she’s up to, Francie will be fine,” Tom said. “You don’t know that,” Ruth said. No one spoke, but Evelyn knew they were each thinking of all the ways Francie had recently been less than fine. In the past year, she’d lost her buoyancy. She’d become sullen, remote, even unfriendly. It was to be expected; she was a teenager. Ruth had been no picnic at that age. But the change in Francie was so abrupt. And then she’d gotten herself into drugs. Nothing terrible, according to Ruth. But she’d been suspended from school for a week. Even though she was a smart girl, her grades were falling. Ruth admitted to Evelyn that she suspected that Francie was already having sex, but, wary of her daughter’s tendency to fling every criticism in her mother’s face, Ruth had not talked to Francie about that. They had all become frightened of her. Francie was an unexploded grenade in the middle of the family. “She’s already been on her own for a month and nothing went wrong,” Tom said quietly. “And it could be worse,” he added, trying for optimism. “We’re on the Riviera. The Mediterranean is right there.” He pointed, and the other three dutifully looked out the arched picture window next to their table and stared at the dark sea below. The enormity of the world, and the fact that Francie was lost in it, silenced them. Evelyn had never been to Europe. Her friends made a fuss when she told them about her trip, but she wasn’t much interested in travel. She didn’t like to admit it, because people considered you close-minded or fearful, or cheap, none of which she was—well, she was a little cheap, but a person had to be if she were to make do on a secretarial salary without taking handouts from her children. But she’d been forcibly marched through enough vacation slideshows to know that it was a waste of time and money going to a place to see something you’d already seen in photographs just so you could come back and show people a set of inferior photographs. Of course, there were those serendipitous encounters travelers were always bragging about. How they ran into a nice local man in Spain who brought them to a darling place where they had a kind of ham that’s illegal in the States, or how they happened upon the most wonderfully friendly Berber nomads in the Sahara who invited them to tea. The idea that people should make a fetish out of happenstance seemed the height of egomania. Happenstance occurred every single day, everywhere, all over the world, whether you were there to take a picture of it or not. She might not have been much of a tourist, but she knew how to lie out with the best of them, and so that afternoon, she put on her blue swimsuit and her paisley caftan, followed the signs posted on the hotel grounds, and climbed down a treacherously steep stairway to the shore. She was disappointed to find that the beach was rocky and uncomfortable to walk on, but she didn’t mind when the cabana boy, who wore a jaunty neckerchief, set her up with a lounge chair and a wide blue umbrella, and gave her, she was sure, a little grin. After she lathered herself with Coppertone, she drew a cigarette out of her purse and was pleased when the same boy rushed over to light it. She lay back, closed her eyes behind her sunglasses, and exhaled into the sea air. “You are groaning,” said a voice. Evelyn turned her neck and held her hand to her brow so that her eyes could adjust to the surprise of Helene. She was still wearing her traveling dress and matching pumps. Her pocketbook was lodged in the crook of her elbow. “You got down here like that?” Evelyn said. “In heels? You could have broken your neck.” “Tom and Ruth are going back to Paris,” Helene said. Evelyn got out of the chair. “I’ll have to pack,” she said. “They’ve already left.” Helene did not hide the pleasure she took in being the first to know. “The famille in Tours called back. Apparently one of the other children they are being paid to keep knew what Francie was planning.” Helene took a step and her heels sank between the rocks, throwing her off balance. Evelyn reached out to steady her, and for a brief moment, the women held one another awkwardly. The cabana boy arrived with another lounge chair and set it up, disappointingly, so that the two could share the umbrella. Helene sat, slipped off her shoes, brushed sand from the leather, and then, after an indecisive moment, lay back and placed them on the mound of her stomach. Her only concession to the idea of leisure was to cross her feet at the ankles, where, Evelyn noticed, grit had become lodged in the mesh of her stockings. “Don’t you want to put on something … cooler?” Evelyn asked. “I’m fine,” Helene said, adjusting her dress so that it didn’t ride up past her knees. “I feel like I’m sitting next to the abominable snowman. They have a dressing room down here. Let me run up and get your swimsuit.” “I have none.” “We’ve come all the way to the Riviera, and you didn’t pack a swimsuit?” “I do not wear one.” “Ever?” Helene’s silence was her answer. “What about when—” There were so many ways to finish that sentence. What about when Tom was young? What about when Helene was young? But Evelyn said nothing. Acknowledging that she had never worn a swimsuit was Helene’s inadvertent confession of a life lived at a remove from matters of the flesh, possibly from sex. Evelyn wondered how often Helene and her deceased husband, whom she referred to as The Doctor, had made love. “Well, you’re better off,” Evelyn said. “What with the skin cancer they’re talking about now.” “Obviously not something you concern yourself with.” “I don’t want to get skin cancer, but I do want to get a tan. I don’t want to get lung cancer, but I do want to smoke cigarettes. I do more than I don’t, I guess.” “That’s shortsighted.” Evelyn tapped the prescription sunglasses on her face. “Bingo.” They were quiet for a while. Evelyn was conscious of the sound of the sea, the rhythmic crash and suck punctuated, every so often, by the shouts of a child or the caw of a gull. The unpleasant noise of a motor grew louder until a biplane appeared, dragging an advertising banner behind it. On it, a woman smiled hugely, her red lips open to reveal a set of gleaming white teeth. A moment later, the airplane released what looked like a flurry of confetti, but turned out to be small tubes of toothpaste. Children rushed to collect the treasure as if money had just dropped from the sky. “The French,” Helene said. “I’m going for a dip,” Evelyn said, standing. “I will hold down the fort.” Evelyn was not certain whether Helene was being ironic. She might have, in all seriousness, been promising to guard Evelyn’s towel and cigarette case from the marauding hordes for whom trial-size toiletries were a prize. The water was so cold that Evelyn briefly reconsidered, but she didn’t want to appear squeamish. She waded in until the water reached the tops of her thighs, and then her waist. The tide was strong. After considering her hair, which had survived the trip without losing too much body, she eschewed vanity, and dove. When she surfaced a few feet away, she instinctively turned and waved toward the beach, then felt silly for this bit of exuberance. Even if Helene were looking at her, she would not be impressed by Evelyn’s bravery or her late-stage athleticism. The cabana boy was busy with some teenage girls. It occurred to Evelyn that with Tom and Ruth gone to Paris, the only person she knew in this foreign place was a woman she disliked, and who she was sure disliked her. Suddenly she understood that it was possible to feel so barely tethered to the world that with one snip of a single thread, you might float away, like that smiling woman in the sky. For the first time all day, she felt anxious about Francie. Tom and Ruth, worried about their daughter’s restless anger and, more disturbingly, her ennui, threw money at the problem. Thus, this summer in France. It wasn’t the best solution, but it was also understandable. If she’d had any money when her husband died, Evelyn would have bought her daughters whatever they asked for. No one said that material things could compensate for sorrow, but inconsequential pleasures could at least fill time, and time was all that Francie needed. Evelyn was sure of it. She needed the years to pass as quickly as possible so that she could look back and realize that she no longer felt the way she once did, when her rage and her despondency battled each other for advantage. Evelyn had been a powerful swimmer as a girl, and even now, as she swam back and forth, parallel to the beach, she felt her strength. She tried different strokes—the crawl, the breaststroke, even the sidestroke, which always seemed invented for ladies who did not want to sacrifice femininity to sport. She flipped onto her back and moved her hands in figure eights. The sun was still high, and she closed her eyes against it. When she opened them next, she looked toward the beach, but it wasn’t there. She tried to stand, but her feet didn’t touch bottom. Fighting a rising panic, she spun herself around. There was the beach, but it was so far away. The sculling of her hands was no match for the tide, and she had floated much farther out than she’d intended, farther than the other swimmers. She began heading toward shore, but somehow, in her agitation, her accomplished strokes deserted her, and she flailed sloppily, sending up geysers of water but making little forward progress. After a few minutes, she righted herself, holding her chin high to keep her nose and mouth above the waterline, and pointed her toes until her foot scraped against something hard. The connection calmed her, and she started to swim again, but her body began to feel odd. This was not exhaustion. It was something more sodden, as if her bones had turned to cement. Soon, she could barely move her arms through the water. She called out, but the wind was coming off the shore and no one heard her. Her body felt gluey now. Something was happening in her brain, too. For a moment, she considered how nice it would be to stop moving, but then she swallowed water, and the shock of it reminded her that she was about to drown. By the time she was within reach of the shore, a crowd had formed. She was dragged out of the water, her knees scraping against the broken shells and pebbles. Someone said “oursin” and then there was a clamor of shouts. Bodies hovered above her, blocking out the sun. Or maybe she was blind. There was a heated discussion. She plucked out the word médecin. Yes, she thought slowly, I need medicine. “What is this? What is happening? Let me through!” There was general murmuring and the onlookers parted. L’Air du Temps wafted over Evelyn’s head. “This woman needs medical attention!” Helene bellowed. “Someone call an ambulance. Ambulance! I am the wife of a doctor. Do what I say!” Do what? What was this ridiculous woman going to do to her? Evelyn tried to speak, but she couldn’t get her mouth to work. She attempted to sit up, but once she was resting on her elbows, she had no strength to go further. There was that nice cabana boy. He might take care of her. But why was he unzipping his pants? And then, before she could object, she felt warm liquid splattering over her toes. She would die, and the last thing she would see would be the self-satisfied smile on Helene’s face as she watched a boy urinate on Evelyn’s foot. “I’m sorry, but Mrs. Brenneman does not want to see you.” The receptionist stood before her. Evelyn tried not to react to the insult. “I was under the impression that she doesn’t remember me or anyone else for that matter.” “Oh, I didn’t mean it that way,” the girl said, her face reddening. “They can’t get her out of bed.” “Then I’ll go to her,” Evelyn said, standing. “She didn’t request a room visit,” the girl said. “Oh, for God’s sake,” Evelyn said. “How would she request a room visit if she doesn’t even remember there are people who might want to see her?” “It’s the rules. She has to make a request.” “Do you have a supervisor?” The girl’s eyes widened. At any moment, she would start to cry. “Listen, dear,” Evelyn said calmly. “I’ve come all this way. From Florida.” And then, throwing in a bit of Helene for good measure, “I demand to see her.” The memory wing was set apart from the rest of the nursing home by a door of the sort, Evelyn thought, you’d find in a prison. “Flight risk,” an orderly said as he unlocked twin safety locks, then led her down a hallway. In the other part of the home, old people were moving about in wheelchairs and walkers, and nurses engaged them in loud, barking conversation. In this wing, the halls were empty. The silence was unnervingly suggestive of the minds of the residents. Helene’s room wasn’t awful. It was private, at least, and bright; a window had a view of the back lawn, where, Evelyn supposed, Miss Brunner’s mangy goats once grazed. The room was overheated, probably because old people had trouble maintaining their body temperature. Evelyn had begun to notice this in herself; even in the Florida sun, she was often chilled. Tom must have brought a few of Helene’s things from the house to give her some sense of familiarity. The blue upholstered chair she liked to sit in when she was reading the bridge column. Her bureau, painted with a pattern of roses and vines. She recognized the rose-colored comforter, but she hardly recognized the woman who lay underneath it. Helene took up so much less space than Evelyn remembered. Her body, once so obdurately thick, barely made a shape beneath the bedclothes, and her head was nearly swallowed up by the pillow. Her cheeks, without their normal mask of foundation and powder, appeared translucent. Oddly, her hair looked recently set, the sprayed bubble of it holding its own against the insult of so much diminution. Evelyn wondered if Tom was thoughtful enough to realize his mother couldn’t live without her weekly wash and set. Or maybe this was Ruth’s doing. Tom and Ruth’s bitterness and recrimination had given way to a protective tenderness, as if they each knew how breakable the other was. Suddenly Evelyn missed her daughter terribly. She hoped Ruth would want to see her, that she would invite her to New York for a visit. She pulled the blue chair to the bedside. Helene’s eyes were closed, and she was breathing shallowly but evenly. Evelyn started to speak, but then stopped. She didn’t want to frighten the poor woman. Helene was so defenseless. Her hands rested on top of the covers. The joints of her fingers were arthritically askew, the knuckles swollen and painful looking. Evelyn took one of Helene’s hands in hers. The skin was satiny and warm. This heat seemed to come not from the temperature of the room but from within Helene’s body. The determination of her blood, continuing to pump so fiercely despite everything, was a loyalty that made Evelyn’s throat tighten. Tom might have been keeping on top of his mother’s hair, but Helene’s fingernails were a mess. They had been cut short and blunt by someone who clearly didn’t want to take the time to shape or file the sharp corners. Her cuticles were ragged and dry. Evelyn reached into her purse and found the small tube of moisturizer she carried with her. She poured out a generous dollop and massaged the cream into Helene’s skin, paying particular attention to the frayed nail beds. This wasn’t the right product for cuticles, and she wished she had her manicure set so she could really get to work with her file and clippers. Helene sighed deeply and slowly opened her eyes. She stared at the ceiling. Evelyn couldn’t tell if she was aware that anyone was in the room with her, or that someone was holding her hand. “It’s me, Helene,” Evelyn said quietly. “It’s Evelyn. I’ve come to see you.” Helene’s gaze fell vaguely in Evelyn’s direction. “Have you had a good rest?” Evelyn said. Helene’s eyes shifted away toward whatever middle distance marked the outer limit of her view. Evelyn must have fainted after the boy peed on her, either from humiliation or from the effects of the sea-urchin poison coursing through her system. Someone had carried her all the way up those perilous steps to her room and laid her down on the bed. She must have slept for a long time, because when she woke, it was night, and Helene was sleeping beside her. The lamp next to the bed was still turned on, and it cast a shallow glow. Both of them were wearing their nightgown, although Evelyn had no memory of changing. It must have been Helene who had pulled off her suit. She must have washed the salt from Evelyn’s skin and dressed the cuts on her knees. She must have demanded that someone find her the bandages she used to wrap Evelyn’s foot. She would have leaned Evelyn against her so that she could fit the gown over her head and shoulders and pull her arms through the sleeves one after the other. Just the way Evelyn had done when Francie was little and slept at her apartment, the drowsy girl so sweet in her floppy acquiescence. Just the way Helene must have done, too, Evelyn thought, when Francie stayed with her. She felt embarrassed that Helene had seen her naked and helpless. She reached for her foot. It was swollen, and the slightest touch sent sharp pains up her leg. But that gummy feeling was gone, and her sight and hearing were sharp. She brought her hand to her nose and sniffed. There was no smell. Helene must have washed off the urine as well. Helene’s breasts were loose underneath her nylon gown, and Evelyn could see their flattened, oblong shapes. Yummy pillows. It was something Francie had said once, when she had laid her head on Evelyn’s proudly firm chest. She’d said her other grandmother had yummy pillows there, and implicit in her heedless observation was a preference. The phone woke them both the following morning. Evelyn listened and then hung up before Helene had a chance at it. She took an extra few moments to get herself out of bed, hobble painfully to the wardrobe, and put on her robe, before delivering the news. “They’ve found Francie. In Paris.” Helene made a frightened noise, shot out of the bed, crossed the room with uncommon speed, and frantically began to pull dresses from hangers, filling her arms until she could carry no more. She stopped suddenly, holding the wadded mass of her beautiful clothing like a bale of dirty laundry. She looked as if she had woken up in the middle of a dream and had no idea where she was. “Poor Francie,” she said. “Poor Francie?” Evelyn said. “Poor us!” She felt a sudden rage toward the girl who had her family wrapped around her finger, who had dragged them across an ocean and then back and forth across a country. All this money spent! Who knew how long it would take Evelyn’s foot to heal? Tom and Ruth’s marriage was in trouble, and the daughter they’d raised together, whom the four of them had doted on, and praised, and believed to be so special, had turned out to be nothing more than a selfish teenager. Poor Francie indeed! Evelyn took Helene’s clothes from her and began to fold and pack them, while Helene stood before her suitcase, as if befuddled. Then Evelyn gathered her own clothing and did the same. “We need to get a move on,” she said, rattled by her earlier outburst and Helene’s uncharacteristic incompetence. But then she realized that Helene was no longer confused. Her hand was over her heart. Her lips moved. Evelyn heard “allegiance.” She heard “the United States of America.” Helene’s faith in the things she counted on was as imperative to her as her breath. Just as Tom suspected, Francie was broke. She’d left a message with the hotel concierge the previous night, asking for money to be wired to Paris. Tom and Ruth had waited at the American Express office. Evelyn never asked what kind of reunion it had been, whether Tom and Ruth had managed to contain their anger, whether Francie, in the end, had been grateful to see her parents and sorry for the trouble she’d caused. The whole event got swept up in the drama of the separation and divorce, and then the story was lost following the greater tragedy. Nine years after that trip, Evelyn had picked up her ringing phone. She was startled to hear Helene’s voice on the other end. They had not talked for so long. She had never heard Helene cry before, and for a minute, she couldn’t make out what she was saying through the awful strangulated sounds. Until she could. And then she didn’t want to believe what she heard, but after years of failed psychiatry and unsuccessful rehabilitations, and the hopeful, hopeless questions Evelyn asked every time she spoke with Ruth—Have you heard from her? How is she doing?—it all made a horrible sense. Later, after the emergency room and the calls to Tom and Ruth in their separate cities, Evelyn had an unforgivable thought, one that haunted and shamed her. She was upset that Francie had shown up out of the blue at Helene’s house, that she had taken advantage of the offer of her shower and guest bed before she used what turned out to be too much of the drug she carried with her. Evelyn knew she couldn’t have saved the girl, but she would have liked to know that, in her despair, Francie had chosen her. She would have shown Francie that her love abided, before the girl let herself be dragged down beneath her dark sea. Evelyn stood and leaned over the hospital bed so that she was looking into Helene’s eyes. “It’s Evelyn,” she said gently. “It’s Francie’s Nana.” At the mention of the girl’s name, something shifted. Helene didn’t move, nor did she make a sound, but Evelyn sensed a charge in the room. Or maybe she was imagining things, and the mention of Francie meant nothing to Helene, who was no longer able to remember what Evelyn longed to forget. Evelyn was suddenly cold. She slipped off her shoes, lifted the edge of the cover, and slid into bed beside Helene. She stared at the cracks in the ceiling paint, tracing their jagged pattern with her eyes. Poor Francie. Helene had been right about that. Because look what had happened to their beloved girl. She’d lost herself, and not one of the four of them had been able to find her. Somehow, Helene had known how it would all turn out."

        "year": "2020",
        "story": " “Naw, you don’t have to worry about me,” Thomas said, after his mother had finished her characteristically perfunctory warning to us about drugs, alcohol, and rough-looking types. “Paul thinks he’s cool now, though.” “Paul, when did this happen?” Mrs. Rickley said. She wasn’t a hip mom, exactly, but she got points for not caring particularly about what her children or their friends got up to. She was a physics professor at Princeton and had consistently made it clear that she did not need this shit. “I just woke up one morning wearing Ray-Bans,” I said. “I guess it was for an album-cover shoot, and it kind of spiraled out from there.” “He’s trying to impress girls now,” Thomas said. “Oh, God forbid, Thomas,” his mom said. “Maybe you should try to impress a girl. After your hair grows back. And don’t be a smart-ass, Paul.” Thomas had surprised me with a freshly Bic’d skull and a three-piece suit when I arrived at his house a few hours before the concert. His light-blond hair and pale skin had already rendered him a solid candidate for the Hitler Youth; now he looked like genuine trouble, or at least troubled. The new look was an homage to one of the bands we were going to see, Execution of Babyface, whose members each rocked the “shaved head/natty threads” combo. EOB fans were notoriously violent, even for hardcore kids, and Thomas and I, best friends and cultural comrades since we were 10 years old, had spent a lot of time on message boards reading (probably?) untrue rumors about coordinated windmill-fist phalanxes and secret seven-inches given only to “executioners” who could present the band with a tooth, or teeth, knocked free during a show. It was all a bit scary and conspiratorial for punk rock, and even at that early stage, it was much more Thomas’s scene than mine. But I did enjoy the music, or was at least fascinated by it. It was pulverizing and ultrafast and punctuated by terrifying screams. EOB’s lyrics were inspired by Guy Debord, John Ashbery poems, and Kevin Smith movies, though you generally couldn’t catch them in real time. It was a substantial leap from the Punk 101 I’d absorbed from a rudimentary website run by a Russian autodidact, which was filled with long paeans to the brilliance of London Calling, Zen Arcade, and the brief, collected works of Rites of Spring. I’d just turned 16. Mrs. Rickley pulled up to the venue, which turned out to be a wide single-story building off Route 35, a quiet highway in South Amboy, wherever that was. Before I learned to drive, I never had any idea of my location in space—it seemed impossible to pay attention to something like that from a back seat, so I never tried. There were only a couple of years between my learning to drive and the rise of the talking navigation machines, which reduced the world to their glowing screens and precise, incorrectly pronounced instructions. In other words: Is it any wonder that I still have no idea where I am? “All right, guys, I’ll be back for you at midnight,” Mrs. Rickley said. “Be ready. For every minute you’re late I’m going to—what? Dock your allowance? Do you have an allowance?” “Sure, we’ll come out when the show’s over,” Thomas said. “I know Paul heard what I said.” “Yeah, we’ll definitely meet you out here when the show’s finished,” I said. “Paul, do not be an asshole to me. I’ll see you here at 12.” She drove off and we walked the length of a long line of people waiting to get inside. It looked to be maybe one-third EOB guys—all guys—trying not to look self-conscious in their suits; one-third old-school punks in the usual leather, plaid bondage pants, and assorted paraphernalia; and one-third shaggy-haired, emo-adjacent kids in black T-shirts and jeans, like me. We finally found the end of the line, wrapped all the way around the back of the building. “Doors were at seven and it’s 8:15, so I sure fucking hope we’re not missing Class of ’36,” Thomas said. “It shouldn’t be that hard to get people in,” I said. A raccoon-eyed girl in a leather jacket turned around. “Some EOB jackass threw a smoke bomb before anyone even went on,” she said. “So everybody had to leave and come back in. And now they’re doing, like, cavity searches, I guess.” “Fucking fascists,” Thomas said, though the security response sounded reasonable enough to me. He took a Swiss Army knife out of the breast pocket of his suit jacket and contemplated it. “Why did you bring that?” I said. “Open stuff,” he mumbled. He crouched down next to a shrub on the side of the building and clawed at the mulch below, then dropped his knife in the hole and covered it back up. “Like 50 people just watched you do that,” I said. “Punk is trust,” he said. We inched forward. I wished I had a cigarette—wished I smoked cigarettes. This was what they had been designed for, looking cool while waiting for things. Word was you could buy them, no questions asked, at the kiosk in Palmer Square as long as you were sure that no one from school was around. Though he’d never said it, my guess was that cigarettes were even lower in Thomas’s moral hierarchy than alcohol or drugs or sex because the pose-to-effect ratio was so high. Per Minor Threat: I. JUST. THOUGHT. IT. LOOKED COOL. Thomas shadowboxed next to me. “What—is—the—holdup?” he said, punctuating the last word with a knockout punch. “Class of ’36 kind of sucks anyway,” I said. They were, again per the internet, third-tier Rancid knockoffs, with lots of “oi oi oi”s and rousing shit about the Spanish Civil War. “They’re better than standing around looking at a closed fucking auto-parts shop,” Thomas said. A couple of minutes later, a chant went up in the crowd: “EOB. LET US IN. EOB. TEAR IT DOWN. EOB. FUCK YOUR LIFE.” Despite the infamy of the band, and the implied threat of the chanted lyrics, this didn’t strike me as a crowd that was going to start a riot, at least not right away. But the recitation gained force, and, as sudden as the opening of a traffic bottleneck when the wrecked car is finally towed, we started moving swiftly toward the door. “Finally, collective action,” the Mohawked guy ahead of us said. He dropped his cigarette and pulverized it into a smear of tobacco with a heavy black boot. “All right, dude,” Thomas said. “Things might get crazy in there, so we’ve gotta have each other’s backs. If we see one of us getting in trouble, we’re gonna step up, right?” “Don’t do something stupid,” I said. “You’re not that big.” The old anxiety bubbled in me, less fear than anticipation. I wanted, then and always, to have the best night of my life, to do whatever thing would change me forever. Everything I read and listened to insisted that all was building toward catharsis. There could be no complete self without eruption, revelation, and the possibility of total defeat, however unlikely. At the door, the fat white bouncer gave me a cursory pat-down—pockets, belly, chest, go—but he held Thomas back and made him take off his jacket and vest, lift up his shirt, even stick out his tongue. “Profiling sons of bitches,” Thomas muttered. “’Scuse me, son?” the bouncer said. “You’re doing a very good and thorough job.” At the ID table, I received the black X’s in Sharpie on the backs of my hands. Thomas had apparently already drawn red ones on his, a frequent-enough occurrence, I guess, that the ID guy simply waved him on, eye roll very much implied. Class of ’36 was in the middle of a song when we got into the main room, the one with the chorus that went “Whoa-ahuh-uh-oh, we’re taking it!” Maybe 50 people were jumping in place or standing with their arms crossed in front of the stage, occasionally shoving the skinny kids who were doing the stumbling-and-swaying-while-being-overcome-with-feeling thing. Save it for your subgenre, guys. Most of the EOB and hardcore-looking guys were stalking around away from the stage, looming over the merch table and wandering along the walls giving fist bumps to confederates. The bar was being used as a convenient leaning post by large, bearded dudes in hooded sweatshirts, most of whom were drinking water out of clear-plastic cups, if they were drinking anything. Over the course of the night, I saw people swigging out of flasks and label-less plastic bottles and discreetly hitting one-hitters, but I didn’t see a single person buy a drink at the bar. The merch table had a copy of the original Babyface EP on vinyl, which came out before the band was forced to change its name, because of a cease-and-desist order from Arista Records. (As if consumers would somehow mistake a violent, surrealist hardcore band for the smooth-singing R&B guy, but whatever.) I wanted to buy it, but didn’t know what I’d do with it during the show. “How many of those do you have?” I shouted. “Extremely limited, dude,” the merch guy shouted back. He was good at his job. I sighed and bought it for 10 bucks, put it under my arm, and went looking for Thomas. I spotted him near the wall to the left of the stage, glaring furiously at the band. “You were right, they fucking suck,” Thomas said. “They’re actually better than I thought they’d be,” I said. I did think that, but mostly I wanted to contradict him. He turned his attention to me. “I already have that,” he said, nodding at the record. “You never see it around, so I figured I should grab it,” I said. “Right, because rarity is an accurate proxy for significance.” “I’m with capitalism on that one, yeah.” Thomas turned his attention back to the stage. “It’s gonna get all fucked up in the pit.” I put the record on the floor, leaning it against the wall, my carelessness intended as a further misguided rebuke to Thomas, and walked away into the thickening crowd. “I want to thank all you motherfuckers for keeping it real and keeping real punk the fuck alive,” the lead singer of Class of ’36 said. “This is our last song, it’s about not giving a fuck whether you live or die. Everybody stay safe tonight, look out for each other.” They started into “Suicide Mission,” and people surged forward, shoving and skanking and, in a few cases, wildly swinging their fists. A skinny guy with a buzz cut made eye contact and gave me a frantic, bobbing thumbs-up. I gave him one back. “Up, up!” he shouted. He lifted one foot off the ground and pressed his hand into my shoulder. I didn’t understand that he wanted to crowd-surf until he tried to plant his foot in the middle of my leg, at which point I bent down and let him use my thigh for leverage. He stomped down on me and dug his fingers deeper into my shoulder and remained poised in that precarious state until a girl in a tank top crouched under his other foot and hoisted him up onto the heads of the people in front of us, who put their arms up and passed him forward. The guy lay on his back, aloft, and pumped his fist slightly out of time with the lyrics of the chorus: “I said CHELSEA, I’m not coming back, the smoke is coming in and we’re under attack. It’s a SUICIDE MISSION, there’s no turning back, the flames are getting high and the walls are turning black …” A girl rocking tattoo sleeves with a flowered sundress clambered up onstage, saluted the audience, then went stiff and fell face-first into the pit. She was caught and passed back through the crowd. A pair of hands egregiously grabbed her breasts, prompting her to kick her heavy boots—hard—at the heads of the people holding her legs, which caused the bottom half of her body to abruptly drop to the floor. Somebody—quite possibly the guy who’d groped her in the first place—lifted her up by the armpits and stood her upright, at which point she immediately resumed head-banging and charged back toward the stage. When the band finished, the PA played “Search and Destroy” at half the volume of the live set and people drifted toward the edges of the room. I spotted Thomas sitting against the wall in the spot where I’d left him. He had his hands to his temples and he was staring at his lap. Oh, was the lame-ass opening band too loud for him? There were still two more to go before the band he wanted to see. I left him alone and drifted out a side door to the smoking area, a small concrete patio enclosed by a genuine red-velvet rope. Most of the smokers looked much older than me, but a round-faced girl with pink streaks in her hair looked about my age, and open to solicitation. “Nice to see a Cure shirt in the mix,” I said. “Wanted to remind the emo kids,” she said. “Boys, just don’t.” “Word,” I said. Under my hoodie, I was wearing the Get Up Kids T-shirt with the brass knuckles on it, which was funny, in theory, because the Get Up Kids were extremely sensitive. “I know this is awful, but is there any chance I could trouble you for a cigarette?” “Sigh,” she said. “Start ’em young, I guess.” She offered me a cigarette and a lighter. It was a Parliament, and I turned it end over end a couple of times to make sure I didn’t light the filter. Then I flicked the lighter repeatedly, failing to create a flame. I shook it and cupped my hand around it and tried again. Nothing. “Windy,” I said, though it wasn’t. “Here,” she said, and took the lighter. I put the cigarette in my mouth and she held the fire to it. “Inhale, man, inhale!” she said. I did, and started coughing when the smoke hit my lungs. “Oh man, you do not smoke,” she said. “I just haven’t in a while,” I said. “It’s okay, dude. Gotta start somewhere. Who are you here to see?” “My buddy’s super into EOB. I don’t know the other bands that much.” “Oh, Fall to Shadows is next. They’re all right, but if you’re into more melodic stuff, I think you’ll dig Secret Keepers. They’re on second to last. I can see that Get Up Kids shirt peeking out there, no worries.” “You are one on whom nothing is lost,” I said. I’d read about Henry James recently because a girl I thought I liked had told me that The Portrait of a Lady was her favorite novel. I’d taken The Golden Bowl out of the library, but it might as well have been in German for all the sense I could make of it. “Fuck yeah, dude,” she said. “And I’m Karen, thanks for asking. Kind of a scene queen.” “Paul,” I said. “Straight-up wannabe.” “It’s a glamorous life, for sure.” The cigarette was going down easier now, though it still felt pretty terrible, and was making me light-headed. “Is this Babyface stuff really as nuts as everyone says it is?” I said. “I mean, it’s definitely violent,” Karen said. “As a member of the fairer sex, I prefer not to get in the middle of it, but it’s not much worse than the usual dumb hardcore shit. Unless you piss off one of the idiots. You shouldn’t wear your glasses.” “I’m pretty blind without them.” “Exactly. You wanna go in?” She flicked her lit cigarette an impressive distance into the street. I dropped mine on the ground and put it out with my heel, then picked it up and tossed it underhand over the velvet rope. “Aw, newbie,” Karen said. “How old are you?” I said. “Sixteen. Well, in a couple months. See you inside.” I waited a polite 10 seconds and then followed her. A big crowd had gathered for the next band, and I didn’t see Thomas among them, or against the wall. My record was still there, though, looking intact. Maybe punk was trust. Raw Power had gotten to “I Need Somebody,” which meant that a band had to be coming on soon; surely it was bad form to let an entire album play between sets? I saw the guy who’d crowd-surfed off me and he gave me a curt nod. Then the lights went down and the crowd pushed forward. I let the people go around me and stood in front of the line of burly, self-appointed enforcers. When I looked over my shoulder, I saw that Thomas was among them, almost right behind me, arms crossed, feet set. “I thought you’d abandoned me,” I said. “Naw, man, that nostalgic shit just gives me a headache,” he said. “I’m straight now, though. Smoking is bad for you.” “Yeah, it makes you feel like shit, too,” I said. Thomas looked highly energized, so much so that I was a little suspicious. Surely he hadn’t … done anything, substance-wise? There was no way to ask without pissing him off, and I liked him better like this, whatever the cause. We watched the set from a defensive position in the back of the scrum, shoving flailing kids back into the pit and helping fallen girls and large men alike off the increasingly slippery floor. Fall to Shadows weren’t bad, despite their unfortunate nu-metal vibe and the fact that I wasn’t at all sure what they were on about. (“I lament (?) you from my—[shaking? shaven?]—chest [____], WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”) When they finished, we ambled to the bar like victorious athletes and gulped water. Thomas spent the keyboard-heavy, sparsely attended Secret Keepers set bobbing on his toes and opening and closing his fists while I bopped along too, semi-bored. Seconds after they finished—“You guys are fucking awesome, EOB is up next, everybody be safe out there”—the men in suits started pressing forward, pushing us up to the front of the stage. “Are you cool with this?” Thomas said. “We’re here, right?” I said. We were surrounded by pinstripes and solemn, shiny heads. Some of the suit jackets had been decked out with punk stuff—metal studs, anarchy-symbol pocket handkerchiefs—but most were anonymous, which, as intended, just made them more intimidating. A roadie in a suit came onstage. “CHECKKKKKKKKKKK!” he screamed, neck veins bulging. He pointed upward. Louder. “CHECKCHECKCHECK CHECKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.” He pointed upward again. “CHECK MOTHERFUCKING CHECK,” he screamed. “CHECK DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE DIE DIE.” This got big cheers. Then, without further warning, the band was onstage, hurriedly plugging cords into guitars. We were right up against the metal barrier in front of the stage, and I felt hands pressing into my back and shoulders, urging me to create space where there was none. “All right, motherfuckers, you know who the fuck we are,” the lead singer said. “We don’t want nobody getting killed tonight. But if there’s, uh, a little damage along the way, who’s to say we won’t be a little stronger for it? This is ‘Variation on a Spectacle,’ let’s go.” The band crashed into the song with double-time drums and chest-shaking bass and some unpredictable, processed shrieks that must have been emanating from a guitar. The room disappeared into darkness interrupted by toxic-green strobe flashes. Thomas spun away from me and into the pit. Someone to my right gave me a hard shove in the lower back and I stumbled toward the melee of thrashing people. I kept my hands in front of me and hip-checked a guy into the open floor. Hell yes. For about five seconds, I felt the pure exhilaration promised by a thousand Greil Marcus columns. Then I turned and caught an elbow in the face, the pain so blunt and clarifying that it didn’t register as pain, just pure heat. My glasses went flying and my vision was reduced to glowing red spots underlaid by a sick green. I heard a crack, followed by the fatal crunch of lens underfoot. The pummeling music paused, because all of EOB’s songs were about 90 seconds long. “Glasses!” I called out. “Anybody see glasses?” A blurry someone handed me some bent plastic. “They’re pretty fucked, bro,” he said. “And your face is bleeding.” Somebody grabbed my shoulder. Thomas, blurry. “Who did this?” he shouted. “Nobody,” I said. “It was just random.” “Nothing is random, dude,” he said. The music returned, faster and louder than before, and I ducked behind the sweatshirt mafia by the bar. I touched my finger to my eyebrow and it came away wet. Not great. I held the broken glasses up to my face. One of the lenses was still intact, so I pressed it to my eye socket and moved back toward the main thrashing mass, trying to fulfill my pledge to keep an eye (if only an eye—cute, buddy) on Thomas. I held my watch an inch from the usable lens. It was 10 minutes until midnight. I watched Thomas, in his ridiculous suit, beautiful and stupid, swinging his arms crazily through the air with great speed and no attempt at coordination. He clocked a large, bald devotee in the nose; the guy stumbled away, then turned and rushed at him, launching into Thomas with a linebacker tackle. Thomas’s limbs jerked like a wounded insect’s under the guy, who held him down with both hands. I dropped my broken glasses and rushed toward them, hearing, when I got close, the stream of their obscenities beneath the music. I gave the blurry antagonist a shove, and he didn’t move, didn’t even seem to acknowledge that I’d touched him, and though I hadn’t put everything I had into it, this seemed like an ominous sign. I grabbed blindly at him again, getting ahold of the collar of his jacket, and felt it tear under my hands. Now this indistinct mass of person turned, unlocked himself from Thomas, and stood over me. He shouted something in my direction. I covered my sweat-wet face, trying to shield myself from whatever was going to happen next. I felt his hand on my shoulder, heard more indistinct shouting through the music. Then it clarified: “Dude, you’re fucking bleeding everywhere,” the guy said. “I’d beat the shit out of you, if that’s what you’re into, but you’re covered in blood.” I held my hands out in front of me—the guy, whatever his other shortcomings, was right about the blood. It seemed to be running freely down my face. The shadowy outline of Thomas had materialized, and though I couldn’t see him, I sensed concern. “Okay, buddy,” he said, or something like that, and steered me past the big guys to the bar. I pressed a pile of napkins to my head and held it there. In my mind’s eye, I marveled at my stoicism, which I guess indicated how detached I was, a result, I supposed, of my lack of sight and the knock to the head and the dehydration and the minor blood loss. It wasn’t, Thomas declared, squinting above my eye, a deep cut. I leaned against the bar, letting the music deafen me as he dabbed. (By the time we started wearing earplugs, in our late 20s, it was too late to turn back the significant hearing loss we’d incurred, Thomas’s much worse than mine due to the daily sonic pummeling of the bands that he led during the years I was in college and law school. When Republic of Suffering, his most successful touring concern, came to D.C. during my clerkship year, we stayed up deep into the night in my apartment, catching up. Though by then he’d modified his policy of strict abstinence, Thomas probably drank one beer for every three of mine, and I was, and still am, impressed and puzzled by the fact that he hadn’t taken to booze or drugs as a default response to life’s typical setbacks. At 4 a.m. I heard a faint pounding on my front door. It was the guy from the next apartment over, a muscled young political aide with perpetually wet hair. We were, he said, shouting at the top of our lungs. Didn’t we know it was four in the morning? He had to be up in an hour. We were sorry. When I spoke to Thomas in a quieter voice, I saw in his eyes the effort required to follow along. His responses grew terse and general, like those of someone responding tentatively to questions in a foreign language, and we soon gave up and went to bed.) “Do you mind if I get back in there?” Thomas said with a longing glance toward the pit. “Yeah, no,” I said. “I mean, of course. Get me a tooth.” He vanished and my head started to throb, which, at that moment, I found preferable to the alien light-headedness I’d been experiencing. I hadn’t quite realized until then that every one of Execution of Babyface’s songs was exactly the same. With that revelation came an unlikely surge in desire to join their thick-skulled brotherhood. “Oof, dude,” said a familiar female voice next to me. “You caused this,” I said. “Aw, let mama kiss it,” Karen said. I waved her away, though I didn’t think she was serious. “I can’t see shit,” I said. “Bald guys playing instruments. Bald guys punching each other. You’re not missing much.” “At least the music’s good.” “They’re a little math-y, don’t you think? Not a lot of human stuff.” “The lyrics are actually …” “Yeah, right, I know. But it’s kind of a waste.” We let the music hit us. “It’s funny that you can’t see,” Karen said, very close to my ear. I was worried that she really might kiss me. Then, wetly, nearly inside my head: “You’re just some fucking tourist, aren’t you?” I tried to focus on her. “Maybe,” I said. “So?” “Just giving you shit,” she said. “Everybody’s a tourist. Except Sid Vicious. Kill Devotion’s playing in two weeks at Hamilton Street. Come hang out. Your face is still bleeding.” The maelstrom of noise started up again and she drifted away from me. Up on the edge of the stage, I could just make out something that I assumed was the lead singer of EOB, bent over, screaming. “And you,” he bellowed. “Thank you for your book and yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeear. Something happened in the GARAGE, and I owe it for the BLOOD!” “Traffic!” the crowd responded. “Those lines are by the only real American poet,” the singer said. “There will be no encore, go home and kill yourselves, good night.” Thomas led me back to the wall to retrieve my record, still standing where I’d left it. I pulled it out of the sleeve. It had broken in two, one chunk significantly larger than the other. I handed the smaller piece to Thomas. We walked outside, and the October air turned our sweat cold immediately. Thomas was shivering but trying not to show it. “Do you see your mom?” I said. I was no help in spotting her, of course, and was worried that even no-worries Mrs. R would be freaked out by my grisly appearance. It was well past midnight. “Naw,” Thomas said, scanning the parking lot. Apparently, we were being taught a lesson about coming out late—because we’d made her wait half an hour, she was going to make us wait for as long as she deemed fit. Which of course, like most parental punishments, just wasted more of her own time. We found Thomas’s knife—it had been dug up or accidentally unearthed somehow, but was basically where he’d left it—and I watched while he flipped it in the air unsheathed and mostly failed to catch it. His mother pulled up around 1 a.m., by which point only a few conspiratorial EOB diehards were left in the parking lot to keep us company. “Oh, Jesus, Paul,” she said when she saw me through the rolled-down passenger window. I imagine she’d planned to deliver some kind of wisecrack, something along the lines of “Not much fun waiting, is it?” Now, instead, she got out of the car and hurried toward me. “What happened to you?” she said. I’d never seen her so actively concerned. “Paul, you need stitches.” “It’s not that deep,” I said. “How would you know?” she said, which was fair. “I can’t give you back to your parents looking like this.” “I think it’s an improvement, actually,” Thomas muttered to me when we were in the back seat. “Somebody literally knocked that stupid look off your face.” I said nothing. I’d resigned myself to silence in protest of being taken to the hospital for necessary medical attention. As it happened, I did not need stitches. Stitches, the doctor said, were optional at that point, cosmetic. After much debate with my parents, who were, despite my objections, summoned to the Raritan Bay Medical Center in the middle of the night, I chose to keep the scar. It was a stupid decision. I was afraid of the needle, sure. But I also thought that preserving the evidence of the wound might keep me from turning my youth into cheap nostalgia. As if a scar, of all things, were capable of that. This story is an excerpt from Andrew Martin’s upcoming story collection, Cool for America."

        "year": "2020",
        "story": "Welcome, everyone. What an [INSERT WEATHER COMMENT] day to open a museum. Behind me [GESTURE BEHIND SELF] is the Smithsonian Museum of American Conspiracy. Yes, it’s really there! I know it’s hard to see. The building is clad in the same light-bending mesh the Space Force uses for its stealth ships. There was a surplus. Lucky us. This is an art museum. That’s important. Not a history museum, and not, as the Post has suggested, the Smithsonian’s second zoo. [PAUSE FOR IRONIC LAUGHTER] No, this new institution celebrates an art form. It’s a natural extension of the Smithsonian’s long-standing commitment to American folkways. This might be the deepest, widest folkway of them all. I’ll quote my colleague Helena Hwang, who calls conspiracy theories “the third great American art form, alongside jazz and superhero comics.” Maybe when Disney’s lobbyists finally allow those copyrights to expire, we can build a Smithsonian Museum of Superheroes next door. [PAUSE FOR RUEFUL LAUGHTER] Not likely. This is a new kind of museum. Its collection extends into the exabytes, and it circulates continuously through our displays. The museum’s centerpiece, which you’ll see immediately upon entering, is the meme mosaic: a 21st-century quilt, two stories tall, constantly shifting. It is truly awful, in the original sense. Inside, you will find a literal hall of mirrors. No visitor’s experience will be the same. You’ll learn about the tropes and techniques of an important art form, and you’ll encounter a kind of counter-history: a network of narratives that have established themselves in the tide-pool crevices between real events. “Real events.” There. I did it, didn’t I? Conspiracy theories are often compared unfavorably with the theories, nominally nonconspiratorial, of fields like physics and history. Now, as a historian, I do believe that the activities of these fields, and their output, are different. As a historian, I believe in rigor and, yes, even truth. [DRAMATICALLY] But. As a historian, I also follow in the footsteps of Thomas Kuhn, the 20th-century historian of science who observed that new paradigms arrive not, as scientists would like us to believe—and would like to believe themselves—through vigorous argumentation, in which [PRONOUNCE EXCLAMATION MARKS] minds! are! changed!, but in an altogether more human way: Old scientists retire. Young scientists enter the field. Slowly, surely, the lab turns over. This is the real structure of scientific revolutions. The evolution of conspiracy theories isn’t so different. If anything, it’s faster! Here’s a paradox: 1. No conspiracy-theory believer has ever been “talked out of” believing their chosen theory. 2. All conspiracy-theory believers, at some point, stop believing their chosen theory. By what process, then, do the beliefs of conspiracy-theory believers change? [PLAYFUL SPUTTERING] What, if not rational discourse, makes a conspiracy-theory believer drop the fluoride thing, the UFO thing, the “President Johnson is a robot” thing? What, if not argumentation? What, if not information? Oh, the answer is better than you can imagine. It’s boredom. I’ll confess that my own intuitions around democracy have, for most of my life, associated political change with big, passionate feelings. Enthusiasm, fear, outrage: leviathans swimming powerfully through the body politic. I still believe that those feelings drive change, though the 21st century has not, so far, offered me much evidence. But here’s what else I believe. Here’s what I’ve learned: Boredom, too, is out there among the leviathans. We should be thankful. The old nuclear-power stations functioned by moderating the chain reaction of fissile material with neutron-absorbing “control rods” that could be raised and lowered. Raise them, and the naked uranium speaks more urgently to itself; lower them, and the chatter fades. Boredom is the control rod of conspiracy, and maybe of democracy, too. Without boredom, I honestly think one of the stories in the museum behind me [GESTURE BEHIND SELF] might by now have destroyed this country. [PAUSE TO LET SINK IN] The Smithsonian Museum of American Conspiracy offers something uniquely urgent and relevant to the times we live in. A decade ago, I expected a war. With who? Anyone. Everyone! And I mean a real war—not one of our president’s graceful dances, with all the missiles exploding somewhere over the ocean. Great-power conflict has returned, but with … a calmness. Why? How? I believe that this museum possesses the unlikely answer. President Johnson’s post-Pyongyang global order runs, essentially, on conspiracy theory. That’s not what the president calls it, of course. You know this administration’s foreign policy as Global Kayfabe. You might, additionally, know that the term is taken from professional wrestling. Kayfabe: the presentation of staged events as real, with the understanding that the audience is in on it. Kayfabe: the eager suspension, on all sides, of disbelief. Read: Trump is building a dystopia in real time Of course, it makes sense that our president, who started his career in a wrestling ring, whose persona was formed there, has now adapted kayfabe to the biggest ring of them all. Cards on the table: I am an avid lifelong fan of wrestling, including its international and independent variants. Professional wrestling led me to wrestling fan fiction, which led me to the history of collaborative storytelling, which led me to UCLA, which led me here. So believe me when I tell you: Kayfabe is profoundly creative and communal. No fan of professional wrestling believes the fight they are watching is “real,” but out of enthusiasm and, just as important, etiquette, we act as if we do. And the results are electric. The secretary of state will tell you his boss deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for this innovation in international relations, in which conflicts are staged loudly but bloodlessly, and populist animus is satisfied safely by the geopolitical equivalent of elbow drops. I don’t know if that’s true. I do, however, believe that kayfabe is a conspiracy theory, and conspiracy theory, kayfabe. They both rely on the same eager suspension of disbelief; they both are fundamentally about creativity and community, not cold-eyed fact-finding; and they both are inscrutable, even contemptible, to observers outside the magic circle of their games. Also, they’re both stunningly simple. Even as conspiracy theories play at spider-web vastness, their dramatis personae are as compact as a tag-team match. Kennedy, Hoover, Fidel Castro. Tupac, Biggie, Suge Knight. Musk, Markle, Ocasio-Cortez. Now, maybe, hearing me compare conspiracy theorizing to the healthy play of kayfabe, you feel a growing sense of unease. You should. Because, as we all know, conspiracy theories have other characters, too. Lately, it’s the wealthy and wizened Mind of Soros, the autonomous digital imprint of the activist billionaire. Can AI be Jewish? According to the conspiracy theorists, it can. These are the stories that become cover for pogrom and genocide. They are serious, and the museum behind me takes them seriously. There are rooms inside that are painful to navigate; they feel like being inside the folds of a diseased mind. I don’t recommend them to everyone. But rather than abandon a great collaborative art form to this poison, I propose that we use this museum as a workshop to engineer its rescue. An underappreciated characteristic of kayfabe—and, if you ask me, the primary reason the president’s Global Kayfabe has been so successful—is that its relations are never fixed. Read: The lasting trauma of Alex Jones’s lies One of the great thrills of professional wrestling is something called the “heel turn.” In wrestling terms, a “face” is a hero, while a “heel” is a villain. (There’s more to it than that, of course. Darth Vader from Star Wars is the ultimate heel, but he’s also the charismatic center of the universe. Anyone in the crowd born after 2020, you can substitute—my daughter tells me this is the right reference—Void Tha Goddess. You love to hate her. [PAUSE, LIKE AN OLD PERSON] Right?) When a face becomes a heel—or, the opposite: when a heel is redeemed as a face—it’s like an atom’s radioactive decomposition in the heart of an old reactor. Energy is released. The world is transformed. Even better, the process can repeat! There was an old wrestler known as the Undertaker—this is a figure etched deeply into my heart—who turned from heel to face, face to heel again, and back, and back again, 10 times. Maybe 11; it depends how you count. Endless transformations. The best conspiracy theories are like that, too. There are, I must inform you, a lot of aliens in the building behind me. [GESTURE BEHIND SELF] The Hall of Ancient Astronauts is my favorite part of the museum. To me, this is pure kayfabe: playful and inviting, flexible, an infinite game. The story of pyramid-building extraterrestrials can absorb anything and anyone you throw at it. Mayan temples. Spy satellites. Jesus of Nazareth. Beyoncé of Houston. In this kind of storytelling, there’s a beautiful syncretism. It offers a model of American conspiracy theorizing that is not about unalterable qualities, but rather processes in motion. Endless transformations. You also see this quality in the conspiracy theory about President Johnson and his brawny robot doubles. I like that one a lot. I’ve recently seen it combined with another theory about an octopus civilization hidden near Antarctica: The robot is bait, intended to lure them into revealing themselves. Maybe that story will be in the museum one day. [TURN TO LOOK AT MUSEUM] It’s beautiful, isn’t it? You can almost make out its contours. [TURN BACK TO AUDIENCE] All right. I’ll abandon my kayfabe. There is no Smithsonian Museum of American Conspiracy behind me. No light-bending mesh. No two-story meme mosaic. It’s just the empty lot where FBI headquarters used to stand. We knocked that building down, but our opponents stopped us before we could lay a new foundation. Those opponents said this museum’s contents would be too vile. That the most poisonous of these conspiracy theories had caused too much real suffering in the world. They said building an institution to collect and preserve them was tantamount to a celebration of ignorance. Many of these opponents were, yes, scientists. Maybe they were right. But for my part, I believe we have forsaken a great opportunity, to recognize the collective creativity of a great American art form, and to consider how it might change. Thank you all for coming out on this [INSERT WEATHER COMMENT] morning. If you’d like a tour, you can follow me this way. [TURN AND WALK TOWARD EMPTY LOT] Photo-illustration images: Getty"

        "year": "2020",
        "story": "Last summer, in late July, I received a phone call from my father notifying me of the death of my uncle Teddy, and asking me to come to San Francisco to help him sort through his brother’s belongings before the movers came. My uncle had no children. He had never married, and his girlfriend of many years had gone her own way for reasons—I would later learn—related to the story that will come. He was a quiet figure, my father’s only brother, and overshadowed by my mother’s sprawling clan of six siblings. Indeed, when I first heard of Teddy’s death, I couldn’t remember when I’d last seen him. By then, our weekend family trips to San Francisco were very much a thing of the past. Even to this day, I can’t recall the surname of that girlfriend, an apricot-hued woman who chain-smoked his Camels and who, in contrast to my Aunt Deborah, my Aunt Judith, my Uncle Michael, etc., we all knew just as Donna. Nor did I remember any discussion of why they hadn’t married, or why they had no kids. For me, it was just one of Teddy’s particularities, like the Technicolor fuchsia of the borscht he drank each morning, or the elastic suspenders he wore over his off-white dress shirts, or the background drone of professional wrestling on his bedroom television, which seemed to cycle on some eternal loop. In the beginning, it was the television that helped break down my resistance to those long visits. At home, my mother had banished ours to the bedroom closet, but at some point, in one of the backroom negotiations I now know make up much of parenthood, my parents must have decided that TV at Teddy’s was permitted. So for a time, on a weekly basis, my sister and I would squeeze into the sofa chair of worn yellow corduroy that sat just inches from the screen. This was during the reign of Hulk Hogan, and Randy “Macho Man” Savage, and my uncle’s favorite, Andre the Giant, who, he reminded me on several occasions, though French by birth, was Polish by extraction, and who I thought—for quite some time, and not without some degree of perplexity—was the same Andre as the one in Louis Malle’s My Dinner With Andre, a film I often heard discussed among my parents’ friends. The television, a Sony Trinitron—part screen, part speaker—had 12 channels, accessed by a row of plastic buttons that gave off a satisfying ping when pressed. My father had given Teddy a VCR, yet I don’t remember him watching anything but wrestling. Why this was, I never stopped to wonder. Only later would I consider that something about the cartoon violence functioned as a parody of all violence, and, perhaps, as a catharsis for the real kind that he’d been through. For a living, my uncle ran a small convenience store on Geary, about half a mile from his apartment, purveying a mixture of American junk food and canned Eastern European imports to a motley group of Poles, Armenians, and Russians, alongside a smattering of patients and patients’ families who wandered down from Mount Zion. I can still see it, and from the height of someone no taller than my uncle’s waist: the pair of American flags taped to the cash register, the powdered Kool-Aid and the Cadbury Creme Eggs beside the bonneted baby on the imported Alenka chocolates, the jars of hard candy in their squeaky cellophane, the storeroom with boxes—boxes!—of Topps wax packs. If we were lucky enough, my uncle would allow my sister and me to select a toy or sweet, an act that, at the time, seemed less a demonstration of avuncular affection than evidence of untold wealth. Such was the stockroom bounty that it never even occurred to me that my father, a general practitioner with a growing private practice, was more financially secure of the two. I grew up in an Eichler in the suburbs 50 miles south of the city, with a backyard spanned by two great redwoods that littered their feathered leaves across the insulation tarp on the small, unheated pool. It was hardly great wealth—this was the pre-dot-com days, when a doctor could still buy a house in Silicon Valley—but we certainly had much more than Teddy, for whom financial planning consisted of bribing his homesick Russian landlord with jars of pickled herring that he brined himself. Of course, the differences between my uncle and my father—differences, one could say, between the two Andres—might just have been a product of their difference in age. Teddy was 19 when my father was born in a Queens emergency room, a gap accounted for by years of war and statelessness, and their mother’s steadfast refusal to bring another child into a world that could take everything away. By the time my father arrived, the family’s story—the flight, the work camps, the loss of a first son to Red Army conscription—was all part of a past not often spoken of. My father knew the map: Warsaw, Białystok, the gulags outside Arkhangelsk, then Tashkent, Kherson, Kyiv, and back to Poland when the war was over. There, finding nothing, no one, they’d continued on to Paris, where they lived until they followed their sole surviving cousin to New York. By then Teddy spoke five languages, and none of them well. His vulgar Russian of the gulag nursery, his market Uzbek, his Ukrainian, his singsong French with its pungent Belleville curses—they all served him primarily to play with other children. His Polish started to dissolve soon after they arrived in Queens, and my grandfather suddenly decreed that the family speak only “American,” which remained for years a patois of pantomime and guessed-at words. Hence: the accent (“huishy-huashy,” “Daffy Dug”), the trouble with articles (absent in Polish, also Russian and Uzbek), the seemingly random employ of his or her (such distinction missing in French). Even 30 years later, when I came to know him, he still spoke tentatively. He was afraid, my father once told me, that others would think his imperfect English might suggest ingratitude. It was safer not to speak. My father was taller, stouter, his face tan from tennis and our vacations. Teddy, who probably would have been tall if not for the childhood hunger, gave a fainter, paler impression. Years later, I would often find that my memory of him conjured the unexpected image of driftwood, which, buffeted enough, grows gray and indistinct. Even in his 40s, he wore black old-man slacks, their polyester polished to a sheen around the seat and knees. He walked with a limp, and though it was a limp from childhood—hip dysplasia, unrepaired, my father told me—it added to my sense of his age. Even the apartment I arrived at that Sunday after Teddy passed away seemed to belong to someone of a prior generation. A short hallway gave onto a dining room scarcely larger than the circular table at its center. Then clockwise: kitchen; living room; a second, tiny hallway leading to closet, bedroom, bath. The wall-to-wall carpeting was still the dun of memory, as was the haphazard mix of “Turkish” rugs. The walls were empty but for a mounted set of commemorative plates from the U.S. bicentennial and some scattered oils—horn of plenty, mountain sunset—purchased over the years at flea markets and neighborhood sales. On my father’s suggestion, we began in the living room. The old gray couch would go, of course, as would the dark credenza, pine stained to look like chestnut, filled mostly with issues of Time dating from the ’80s. There were some old Sears catalogs, some shoeboxes organized on unclear principles: paperweights with watch parts, and keys to far more houses, cars, and lockboxes than my uncle possessed. While they seemed to me completely anonymous, my father lingered. Yet when I wondered aloud whether there was a story to any of these artifacts, he shook his head. It was striking, he told me, how little reminded him of his brother, indeed, how little of the apartment reflected his brother’s inner life at all, unless of course one realized that one feature of that inner life was to keep itself hidden. Rather, he was thinking, he said, what he’d been thinking for days: namely, how much he regretted that he had not pressed Teddy to accept more of his charity. I probably didn’t know, he told me, but his brother had supported him during medical school, had moved with him to the Bay Area; it was only fair to pay him back. But Teddy always refused. While at first my father attributed such stubbornness to personal dignity, over time, as the two of them had separated in station, he’d come to understand it differently. Teddy never seemed to begrudge my father’s success. He was drunk and expansive at my parent’s wedding, laughing even at the inside jokes he didn’t understand. He gave a wedding gift, a set of crystal glasses from Neiman Marcus, completely inconsistent with his tastes and far too generous. Long before I was walking, he gave me a bicycle, just as he bought ballet shoes for my sister, as if to stake a claim on milestones to come. Over time, my father said, he’d come to wonder whether such extravagance was Teddy’s recognition of the diverging paths their lives would take, something he saw long before my father did. And it happened: my father often in the clinic, or attending an art-house-film series with friends, or taking us on summer camping trips. Trips to which, he added, he frequently invited his brother and Donna, knowing full well that they would refuse. What the Malle film was to “The Giant,” Arches National Park was to Reno, where Donna gambled and my uncle, I assume, must have spent his time doing something other than eating, and yet returned only with photos of himself (dressed in that eternal off-white dress shirt, his arm slung over Donna’s shoulder) against the bounty of the buffets. They were an odd couple. Now I suspect he was drawn to her for the sheer volume of her Americanness—for her big American hair and white patent-leather heels, for the brooches, bracelets, and earrings that jingled out her presence well before she entered a room. Even her bust, hammocked in polyester pink-and-chartreuse blouses, seemed somehow American in the brash way it called attention to its size. She was of stone-fruit farming stock; the family went as far back in California as anyone could go, she’d say, “without being Miwoks.” She had a history of epilepsy, and though it had been decades since she’d had a seizure, she never learned to drive, and so my uncle chauffeured her everywhere. For as long as I knew him, he drove a Pontiac Bonneville, a model from the early ’70s that reminded my sister and me of the cars driven by kidnappers in those ominous school educational videos that taught us not to talk to strangers. For Donna’s part, aside from the chauffeuring, it was hard to say what she saw in my uncle. He was handsome, or appeared to have once been handsome, and I can recall the occasional waitress, checkout girl, or, later, nurse who was quite charmed by his courtly European manners and his accent. But Donna showed no interest in where he’d come from. She hated the herring and the borscht, and not once did I hear her ask him about Europe. Indeed, she seemed to have almost no awareness of Teddy’s story at all. My father didn’t know whether this was because his brother didn’t want to tell her, or she didn’t want to know; his guess was both, which might go some way toward explaining their compatibility. Or maybe it was this, he said: To Teddy, Donna knew she was uncommon, and we all want to be uncommon, and the moment she realized the error of this understanding was the moment she left. Anyway, my father said, he now regretted the distance that had grown between them, particularly as time went on, and my sister and I grew older, and our weekends filled with sports and friends. They still spoke, but then my father got an affiliated position at the university and began to teach and travel more, and sometimes weeks would pass before he saw his brother. It was because of this, he said, that he wasn’t really certain how my uncle had developed his interest in the war—the Civil War, he clarified—save that it had begun with Donna. At the time, he didn’t think it was remarkable. He had seen his brother go through a similar period of interest in his adopted country earlier, at the time of the bicentennial, though that had a seeking, sad quality to it, as if the commemorative plates, the flag placed on his balcony, were ways of trying out an identity he didn’t possess. My father could remember how on that Fourth of July, he and my mother had gone with Teddy and Donna to watch the celebrations. Parades were not something my father went to regularly—they were, he felt, only for children or for fascists. But Teddy was different. He never spoke of the connection between his observance of certain holidays—the Fourth, Memorial Day, Veterans Day—and the fact that, due to his hip, he had been turned down when he had tried to enlist for Korea. My father wasn’t even born at the time of those rejections, but in later years, he sensed that the sole thing his brother ever envied him for was his two years of service as a doctor with the VA. Indeed, much of his brother’s patriotism stemmed, he thought, not from pride, nor even gratitude, but rather from a kind of longing. After all, he told me, even though his parents never returned to Poland, they still had a home to carry in their memory. Teddy, meanwhile, found himself in the impossible position of missing something he’d never possessed. But yes, the bicentennial: For all my father’s suspicion of patriotism, it began auspiciously. The mood was festive. The slopes of Golden Gate Park were blanketed with drumming corps, students dressed as redcoats played war among the eucalypti, and beauties with long white gloves waved from convertibles bedecked with paper flowers. Donna was dressed in skintight striped red pants and a starry bodice. She’d purchased paper tricornes from a vendor, for my parents and for Teddy, who placed it at a jaunty angle over his thinning hair. He seemed utterly enraptured by the pageantry, my father said, by the parades, the high-school bands and floats. Only later in the day, when my father was returning from the concession stands, did he happen to see his brother at a moment when Teddy thought no one was watching, standing in the middle of the cheering crowd with a look of such raw disconsolation, such unmooring, that my father felt he was perhaps for the first time seeing his brother as he really was. And so, when Donna announced 10 years later that she and Teddy planned to visit historic sites in Gettysburg and Philadelphia, my father thought back to his brother at the bicentennial, and couldn’t help but wonder whether they should travel somewhere else. But he couldn’t bring himself to explain why, and in any case Donna’s sister had been and said it was fantastic, really, and they had already bought the tickets. As it turned out, Teddy, on his return, said almost nothing about the visit. He did not seem anguished, nor particularly thrilled. Were it not for the little Liberty Bell replicas he’d bought for me and my sister, it was as if he hadn’t even gone. All of which explained the surprise my father felt when, later that autumn, he called the shop and Donna told him that my uncle had flown east again, this time for a guided bus tour of famous battlegrounds in seven states. “Apparently it’s his new hobby,” she said. My father stayed by the phone for some time after she hung up. He didn’t know what to think, he told me. It seemed out of character; there was something even humorous about the image of his brother, in his dress shirts and suspenders, following a group of heartland tourists with their ball caps and their cameras slung about their necks. But then, not three months after his return, Teddy was on another flight, this time to Georgia. Soon my father found the dining table stacked with volumes from the Inner Sunset library: books on famous battles, biographies of Grant and Sherman, guides to uniforms and musketry. Particularly guides to uniforms, he told me, which should have been his clue, because it was around this time that the reenactments began. He asked me whether I remembered these, and I answered that I did. Like much about my uncle, I hadn’t thought of them in years, but now that they’d been mentioned, I could still recall the day my sister discovered the vintage revolver in Teddy’s bedroom closet, and the subsequent explanation that my uncle offered my enraged mother. At the time, the gun had clearly overshadowed all other aspects of the story, though in retrospect, it seems amazing that I didn’t find it at least a little odd that my uncle—who still substituted the French mais for the English but, and still referred to cornflakes and Rice Krispies as kasha, and most fruits by their Uzbek names (because in Tashkent, at the age of 10, he ate his first peach, his first plum, his first orange)—had found such purpose in dressing up with a group of strangers, to act out the battles that had burned across fields and pastures so far from his life. But I was 10 when the reenactments started, and still at the age when most adults were equally intriguing and equally dull. Teddy’s possession of a grimy Union uniform, or the image of him charging across a field with other reenactors, was about as remarkable as my Uncle Steven’s double joints, or the huge plastic trophies my Aunt Deborah had collected in her softball league, enough to cover a whole wall. I told my father this. He nodded. And yet the funny thing, he said, was that at the time, as far as hobbies went, he hadn’t found it terribly strange. It was certainly more interesting than “Wrestling Mania” or whatever those ridiculous orgies called themselves. This was the time of Glory and the Ken Burns film. He found his patients reading bookmarked copies of Battle Cry of Freedom in the waiting room; he himself had been slowly making his way through Shelby Foote. A few years later, a reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg would draw some tens of thousands of spectators. The papers and TV loved to cover the events, the tone of the reporting sometimes whimsical, sometimes a bit condescending, but usually at least ending with an elegiac hopefulness that the battles could serve as some kind of ritual through which scars both new and old might be healed. Nor was he the only one to see how the reenactments might offer a baptism for those whose families had come from somewhere else. He could recall a television program that had featured extensive interviews with an expat who traveled each year from Stockholm to don the gray outfit of a Confederate soldier, and a Rhode Islander of Japanese extraction who was “serving” in a Union regiment. Both men, my father said, had testified that participation in the reenactments had for the first time in their life made them feel truly American, though whether this was so for Teddy, my father didn’t know. In any case, he said, he never exactly understood what it was that Teddy did at the reenactments, until a conversation with Donna, at the beginning of the end of Teddy’s life. It was August. By then Teddy had spent more than a decade making almost yearly visits to the battlefields, beginning at Bull Run in 1993, and ending that July, at the Battle of the Crater, when, the day after the reenactment, as he was waiting in the airport lounge of Richmond International, a blood clot, which had likely formed as he lay on the battleground, broke free from the deep veins of his calf. And then, on the CT scan at Bon Secours St. Mary’s Hospital: not only the pulmonary embolism, but the tumor in his lungs. Against the doctor’s advice, Teddy flew home to San Francisco for the surgery, which was where Donna, who had remained a friend despite their separation two years prior, and her subsequent marriage, told my father about the singular nature of his brother’s devotion. They were in the waiting room, amid samovars of lukewarm coffee, and children cavorting over the laps of anxious parents, and a flickering monitor with the first three letters of the patients’ names and the status of their surgeries. It was, he said, the longest conversation he’d ever had with her. Interestingly, she had assumed that his brother had told him much more about his forays. When he corrected her, she told him Teddy was probably just waiting for him to ask. She paused, and after some consideration said, “You know he just went to die, right?” My father, who had glanced up at the monitor, thought for a moment that in his worry, he had missed something. “I’m sorry?” “To die,” she said. “In battle.” But still he didn’t completely understand. Didn’t most of them “die,” he asked? “Eventually,” she said. “But Teddy never even fought.” She clarified: Moments after the bugler opened a reenactment, my uncle would just walk toward the fighting and lie down on the ground. “Just?” “Just.” “Really?” Were his brother not on the operating table, my father told me, he might have laughed in disbelief. “Really,” Donna said. Teddy never made it to the surrender, never stayed for the fairs and dances and trivia nights that often followed. Never drank with the other soldiers, neither from the shared flasks of “authentic” whiskey, nor the anachronistic beers that occasionally appeared in anachronistic coolers as if from outer space. Not only that, but my father also had to understand the context, Donna told him. If anything unites the reenactors, it is the desire to remain alive as long as possible, to participate in the history that they have prepared for so meticulously. It was actually a common complaint among the organizers (not to mention an apparent object of ridicule among the spectators) that none of the grown men playing soldiers wanted to die, particularly not early on. Who would? And miss the action, lying among the cow patties, while all around you, your comrades charged into history with muskets gleaming? Even when a bullet’s strike was undeniable, Donna said, most men would feign an injury, calling for comrades to transport them to the medical tent and the attention of the volunteer nurses. But not his brother. Not Teddy, who spent untold amounts of his dwindling savings on ever more authentic uniforms, not to mention flights and car rentals, and “event rates” charged by roach motels. Not Teddy, who stood on shivering mornings at Vicksburg and Spotsylvania, at Shiloh and Chickamauga, as around him thousands of fellow soldiers, rifles stuffed with paper cartridges, shifted beneath their heavy packs. Not Teddy, who—when the clarion broke across the pastures at Seven Pines and Opequon, and the smoke bombs began to fly at Franklin and Fort Stedman—lay down on the mossy forest path, or beside the bursting blooms of buttonbush, or in the fields. Always on his back and looking up, said Donna, who one afternoon, watching at Antietam, had realized that as much as she loved this man, a part of him would always remain far beyond her reach. Just as she understood that she would leave him, not out of animosity and not with bitterness—life at 75 was too short for either—but because what he was seeking was something she couldn’t provide. He would lie there for hours in that strange vigil, as around him the fighting raged, and slowly, reluctantly, one by one, the others began to fall, sprawling with cries or dramatic gurgles, tearing at hidden bladders of red coloring, tumbling theatrically from their mounts. Sometimes far away, or sometimes near him; sometimes even touching him, resting a hand or head upon his chest. And as the pastures filled, he remained unmoving, the warm sun on his face, or the cold of the winter soil of Fredericksburg seeping through his coat, his back, his aching hip. Until at last the bugle sounded and all at once, together, the dead rose from the consecrated, hallowed ground. By then it was late afternoon in the apartment, and an unexpected sun had broken through the summer fog that rolled unimpeded up and down San Francisco’s long western flank. From the living room, we moved on to a little workroom my uncle had set up in a hallway closet, with mason jars of nuts and bolts, and sundry pieces of wood gathered in the blue Danish butter-cookie tins, where one day they could be found if needed. Then the kitchen, the refrigerator empty save for a tub of sour cream and a two-liter bottle of kvass. We would leave this. Just as we would leave the simvastatin and the digitalis in the bathroom, the dress shoes with their replacement shoelaces, the pantry stocked with jars of cat food he used to mix with sugar and leave out for the strays. In the bedroom, a heating pad still warmed the sofa chair; terrifyingly, the paramedics must have left it on. The chair would go, as would the flanking oxygen stand and vaporizer, the Trinitron with its push-button channels: the Trinitron, on which, one March, Teddy played for me a copy of WrestleMania he’d purchased specially by mail order. Alone that night (my sister at a sleepover, my parents at a play), we’d watched the full three hours, fight after fight, the television’s blue light flickering over us, until the moment—to quote the jubilant words of the announcer—“the irresistible force met the immovable object,” and Hulk Hogan lifted Andre, trembling and helpless as Antaeus, and brought him thundering to the ground. The photographs were in the closet, its mirrored door now bearing a long, diagonal crack. He had kept them in a series of old wooden cigar boxes, next to the Union outfits. I suspect my father had known that we would find them there, and that he had waited because he knew that after he found them, he wouldn’t go on. The room was dark; the only window gave onto the apartment parking lot, where a couple were yelling at each other in Russian, so we brought the photos back into the living room and laid the boxes on the table before the couch. We were all there—Donna in her flowered polyester blouses, and my sister with her braces, and my uncle sitting with me at an ice-cream parlor on a day that suddenly returned to me with such vividness that I could taste (and as I write, can still taste) the cold ribbons of caramel in the melting cream. There was a pair of early photos of my grandparents, taken in a Warsaw studio; and others, of my parents’ wedding, of Thanksgivings, and bar mitzvahs, and the high-school graduation that I hadn’t remembered he’d attended. And then, at last, the photos of the war— not the one he had survived, but the one that, repeatedly, he hadn’t. In contrast to the snapshots, these were different: large-format, commemorative photographs of the reenactments, in period sepia or black-and-white, the scenes instantly, utterly familiar from the albumen prints of Mathew Brady, with their field tents and broken ramparts, their scattered cannons and bodies strewn across the field. And on every photo: a tiny arrow etched in careful blue ballpoint that showed, among the countless fallen soldiers, which one he was. This story has been excerpted from Daniel Mason’s forthcoming collection, A Registry of My Passage Upon the Earth."

        "story": "When I was about 4, my mother and I spent our days sitting side by side on the couch, watching soap operas and eating chocolates and laughing. My mother’s laugh was loud and wild. She never covered her mouth, which would open so wide that I could see the half-chewed chocolate mashed up against the inside of her cheek. She would laugh this way only when we were alone. With my father or in the company of others, she would giggle and put a hand over her mouth. I wanted everyone to see what I saw when we were alone. My mother learned to speak English watching these soaps, and soon she started practicing what she had picked up. When my father didn’t feel like eating, she would ask who he had been eating his meals with that he had no appetite. When a sock went missing from the dryer, she would ask where it had gone, and when he had no answer, she would accuse him of having an affair. My father didn’t take my mother seriously. He tried to keep their talk light, saying he wished that he wasn’t so busy working and that life really was as full of opportunities for affairs as she imagined it to be. But then he would turn serious, saying, “You don’t know, do you? What it’s like for me at work. They all talk so fast in English. Barking at me all the time about keeping up. Sometimes I don’t even feel like a human being.” My parents didn’t spend much time alone, and when they did, there were no Lao bars or cafés or restaurants for them to go to. Occasionally, we were invited to get-togethers at the homes of other Lao refugees. Some had been here a long time, like us, and some had just arrived. These parties were where everyone went to dance and listen to music, play cards and eat, reminisce and talk about old times. They would laugh all night—sad, faint bursts of air—and shake their heads in disbelief at what they had made of themselves in this new country. My parents went to these parties to hear the news from back home or to ask what had happened to those they had left behind. Who was still there? Was their house still standing? And if they’d made it out of Laos, which refugee camp had they ended up in? How long were they there? Where did they land? When my parents read the newspaper or watched the evening news, they never heard anything about what was happening in their country. It was almost as if it didn’t exist. My father was at the center of many of these parties. A wave of laughter would crash in from the living room, and whenever I’d peer inside, I’d see him surrounded by the other guests, telling everyone his stories. The one everyone seemed to love to hear him tell was the “Yes, sir” story, and even though they had all heard it before, he would begin the story as if they hadn’t. He’d tell them how he’d say “Yes, sir!” in English at work whenever anyone told him what to do, but he’d say it with the tone and force of a “Fuck you!” Then he’d march around the room at the party and salute everyone like a dutiful soldier, saying in English, “Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” each time. He’d cackle with glee at how the people at work thought he was so polite and nice. My mother would watch and listen to all of this from the kitchen, but she’d never join in. She’d keep to herself, surrounded by Tupperware, glass casserole dishes, steaming pots, simmering pans, plastic forks and spoons, and paper plates. I would stay there with her, and she’d tell me what each dish was and how it was supposed to be cooked. She would say that some of the key ingredients were missing and that none of the dishes could live up to her memory of the real thing. She’d say that the food in Laos just tasted better and that maybe someday when I was older, we could go back and visit. She’d say all this to me in Lao. One time, a woman in the kitchen overheard her: “Your child understands Lao?” she asked. My mother was proud that I could still have something from the old country even though I had never been there. But the woman said to her, “Oh no, no! Oy! You’d better start speaking English to her. How is she going to fit in once she gets to school?!” When the woman left the kitchen, we laughed at her, how worried sick she seemed about not fitting in with everybody, as if that was a thing to want. Later, my mother encouraged me to go and play with the other kids at the party. They were rowdy and running around and speaking English. I wanted to play with them, but they kept pushing my arm and telling me I was “it.” I did not know what “it” was, but every time I tried to get near one of them, anytime I came close, they’d run from me like they didn’t want to play with me at all. After a while I went back to the kitchen, and when my mother saw me return she asked what had happened, why I’d come back so soon. I told her, “All they do is speak English. I don’t know what they’re playing.” Then she paused for a moment and said, “Maybe it’s something they learned at school. You’ll learn too, when you go.” The closest my mother came to having friends were the cashiers at the Goodwill. They were friendly and knew her by name, and they’d let her wander the aisles for hours. They might only have been doing their jobs, but my mother didn’t see it that way. Once, she brought them egg rolls wrapped in aluminum foil, and they took them to the back room to eat while we picked through the clothing together. But the way my mother walked by the racks, with a hand trailing behind her, made it seem as if she wasn’t really searching for anything she wanted. It made me wonder whether she might have wanted to be invited to the back room to enjoy the food. To distract her from thinking about her egg rolls, I grabbed a yellow dress and brought it to her. She looked at the price tag—one dollar—and nodded. Before we left the store, my mother glanced back at the cashiers. She said to me, “You think they liked it?” Once I started school, my mother watched the soaps alone and told me about them when I came home. There was always an affair, a long-lost twin, someone in a coma, a handsome doctor. After a while, I didn’t want to hear about them anymore. I started reading books, and my mother would come sit with me and have me read them to her. She would ask questions about the drawings inside. The books she liked best were the scratch-and-sniff ones, and the ones where animals popped out at you. Each time I pulled the paper tab and a cat or dog jumped out, she would draw in her breath, surprised and delighted by such a thing. One book was about a sheep, with a cotton patch inside for a body. My mother would pet the cotton with her finger as if it were alive. At night, she would bring a book to my bed and insist that I read it to her. There were not too many words inside. Sometimes she’d fall asleep right away, but when she didn’t, I would make up stories for her. “No one is ever alone in the world,” I said one night. “There is always a friend somewhere for everyone.” She must have been 24 then, but when I look back, she seemed much younger—and smaller. I watched over her, and when she shivered I pulled a blanket up to cover her, trying not to wake her. Sometimes she had nightmares. I could tell by how she was breathing—short, panicked breaths. I would reach out and stroke her hair, tell her that things would be all right, though I didn’t know whether they would be or what it meant to say those words. I just knew it helped to say them. I never thought to ask my mother why she slept in my room most nights. I was just glad not to be alone in the dark. One Saturday morning, we wandered into the toy section of the Goodwill, and my mother picked out something for me. It was a map of the world, a puzzle, 1,000 cardboard pieces inside a box for 50 cents. Each piece had a unique shape that fit with another. The point was to find the other pieces that fit with it somewhere in this pile of shapes and lock them together. When we got home and I sat down to work on the puzzle, she did not pick up a piece or try to help me put it together. Instead, she watched me. She’d say, “That one doesn’t go there. Try another one.” When one fit, she’d say, “Every piece belongs somewhere, doesn’t it?” I would work on the puzzle when I came home from school, and piece by piece, I put the colors together. First the blues, which stood for the oceans. Then the reds, greens, oranges, yellows, and pinks of all the many different countries. Weeks later, only a handful of pieces were left, and when I put in the last piece, I announced with pride, “Ma, I’m finished!” My mother peered at the puzzle and pointed at a green spot. That was where she was from, she said. A tiny country in the lower far-right. Then she pointed to where we were at that moment, a large pink area at the top far-left. After a moment, she pointed to the puzzle’s edge and then the floor, where there was nothing. “It’s dangerous there,” she said. “You fall off.” “No, you don’t,” I said. “The world is round. It’s like a ball.” But my mother insisted, “That’s not right.” Still, I continued, “When you get to the edge, you just come right back around to the other side.” “How do you know?” she asked. “My teacher says. Miss Soo says.” There was a globe on Miss Soo’s desk at school, and whenever she talked about the oceans or the continents or plate tectonics, she would point to those features on it. I didn’t know whether what Miss Soo was telling me was true. I hadn’t thought to ask. “It’s flat,” my mother said, touching the map. “Like this.” Then she swept the puzzle to the floor with her palm. All the connected pieces broke off from one another, the hours lost in a single gesture. “Just because I never went to school doesn’t mean I don’t know things.” I think now of what my mother knew then. She knew about war, what it felt like to be shot at in the dark, what death looked like up close in your arms, what a bomb could destroy. Those were things I didn’t know about, and it was all right not to know them, living where we did now, in a country where nothing like that happened. There was a lot I did not know. We were different people, and we understood that then. A few weeks later, we went to the park. It was cold and the grass was yellow underneath a lumpy sheet of ice. Earlier, I had been reading while my mother watched television. She usually found a show to make her laugh, but that day she couldn’t settle on one. She kept pressing the button on the remote control, flipping to the next channel, and then the next, until she started all over again. I rushed over to the swings, hopped on the seat of one, and pumped my legs so that I shot myself high into the air. My mother sat on a park bench alone, in her blue winter coat, facing me. She was not far. I called to her so she could see how high I had managed to swing on my own, but her head was turned away, her eyes focused on something else. I stopped swinging and turned to see what she was looking at. A man had run out of an apartment building in his boxers and a white T-shirt. He was flustered. A woman dressed in a pantsuit had followed him out, heels tapping on the sidewalk like a pencil on a table. The man glanced behind him, stopped, and screamed, “It’s over. We’re finished!” When the woman tried to embrace him, he batted away her arms. I walked over to my mother and stood right in front of her, blocking her view of the couple. “Let’s go home,” I said. She looked at me and there were tears in her eyes. “It’s snowing,” she said, and glanced away. She said it once, like that. In a small, clear voice. It’s snowing. But the way she said it made it seem like it was not about snow at all. Something that I can’t ever know about her. Then my mother looked up at me again and said, “I never have to worry about you, do I?” I nodded, even though I wasn’t sure whether it was really a question. Soon after, sometime in the night when I was asleep, she walked out the door with a suitcase. My father told me he saw her leave. And he did nothing. All of this was years ago, but I can still feel the sadness of that time, waiting for her to come back. I know now what I couldn’t have known then—she wouldn’t just be gone; she’d stay gone. I don’t think about why she left. It doesn’t matter anymore. What matters is that she did. What more is there to think about than that? Often, I dream of her face, still young like she was then, and although I can’t remember the sound of my mother’s voice, she is always trying to tell me something, her lips wrapped around shapes I can’t hear. The dream might last only a few seconds, but that’s all it takes, really, to undo the time that has been put between us. I wake from these dreams raw, a child still, though I am 45 now, and grieve the loss of her again and again. My father did not grieve. He had done all of this life’s grieving when he became a refugee. To lose your love, to be abandoned by your wife, was a thing of luxury. It meant that you were alive. The other night, I saw an image of the Earth on the evening news. I had seen it many times before, and although my mother was not there, I spoke to her as if she were. “See? It really is round. Now we know for sure.” I said it out loud again, and even though it disappeared, I knew what I’d said had become a sound in the world. Afterward, I went to the bathroom mirror and stared at the back of my mouth. I opened my mouth wide; saw the hot, wet, pink flesh, and the dark center where my voice came out of; and I laughed, loud and wild. The sound went into the air vent, and I imagined the people living in the building who would hear it wondering to themselves where a sound like that came from, what could make a woman laugh like that at this hour of the night."

        "story": "“There was a woman, and everyone watched. Including me. We were at the fields where the kids play soccer. You know?” “I’m there three times a week.” “The place is surrounded by woods.” “I know. Three days a week. No joke. Were the kids playing?” “That’s why we noticed her. She walked across the field mid-game like she didn’t even see the rest of us and disappeared into the woods. The fireflies had started. Maybe 40 minutes before dark? The game must’ve been close to ending. In fact, it did end soon after.” “I was there,” another mother says. “I saw her go.” We’re in L’s kitchen waiting for our kids. Any minute now, goody bags and farewells, then L’s kid will be one year older and alone with a new crop of toys. “Who won?” “Won what?” “The game.” “I have no idea.” J has two kids, two part-time jobs. She’s looking for something better but hasn’t found it yet. Others here work full time, or nights. The fathers are also working, jobs that we hear are less permeable than our jobs. Really our jobs are not permeable, but we lie to our employers, pretending we are not mothers, or that mothering is simple. Then, like an intricate, silent network from the natural world—say, a creek flowing to a stream, to a river, to the ocean, to the clouds, to return as rain—we rely on other mothers. Systems, delicately complex and ever-changing, carry and care for our young. “I don’t remember the score. I was distracted by the woman.” “What’d she do?” “You weren’t there?” “No.” “But you heard about it?” “Bits.” “She crossed the field as if she didn’t even see the game, like she was chasing a stray ball. Sudden and straight across. The way an animal would go. Some of the kids stopped playing. Maybe they thought she was a referee, or that there was an injury. But she ignored the kids, walked right through them and into the woods.” “What’d the kids do?” “Started playing again. And the people watching went back to watching the game. And you know the dad?” “The screamer?” “ ‘Pass! Pass! Man on!’ Ugh. The worst. He went back to screaming. He knows sideline coaching’s prohibited. The fucker even signed a form saying he wouldn’t do it anymore.” The mothers look. Did the kids hear J curse? A secret swear among mothers feels so good—a dirty-word pressure valve and a wormhole to other lives. “Did you say anything to him?” “Do not talk to that man. He’s nuts. I got into it with him once. Big mistake. I was like, ‘Wait, do you actually care which team wins? They’re 8 years old.’ And he’s all like, ‘I love this team! I love my country!’ Holy crap. He’s fucking nuts. He was stomping his foot. ‘It’s Us versus Them!’ Screaming it. ‘Us versus Them!’ I honestly had no idea who he was even talking about. Who’s ‘Us’?” “His poor kids.” “Who’s ‘Them’?” “Does he have kids?” “I didn’t talk to him,” J says. “I was watching the woman. Or I was watching the place where she’d disappeared.” “No one stopped her?” “She’s an adult.” “I’d almost say no one saw her. I mean, I saw her and others saw her, but it was like most of us didn’t wonder what she meant. At least at first. You saw her.” “Yeah, but I didn’t give it much thought. I had the little ones with me.” “Who is she?” “I don’t know.” “You mean you don’t know her or you didn’t see who it was?” “I didn’t see. I might know her.” “She could be anyone?” “Sure.” “One of us?” “Sure.” “Was it you?” “No. Was it you?” Our chatter pauses long enough for us to look at each face, to see if one of us here might walk into the woods. Dead mom, cheating spouse, raped at 14, Down’s kid, nearly broke, alcoholic husband, bankrupt business, Alzheimer’s dad, raped at 22, colon cancer, barely hanging on to sobriety. Each of us looks like a person who might walk into the woods and not come back. “Ask K if she knows. She knows everyone.” “Who was it, K?” K is eating cheesy popcorn. “Was what?” “At the game, in the woods. You hear about this?” “Oh yeah. Somebody told me.” “Who was she?” “I don’t know. Who?” K is no help. We turn back to J. “When was this?” “Last week.” “What happened after she was gone?” “The game was ending. I told you that. Then the game did end and, you know, folding up chairs, collecting water bottles. One of the children had to remind us. Kid says, ‘That woman never came back.’ And someone asked, ‘How do you know she never came back?’ And the kid said, ‘I watched for her. She never came.’ It was that midfielder. Daydreamer, you know. The kids were the only people thinking clearly. They said, ‘We need to go find her. Maybe she’s hurt. Maybe she’s lost.’ And all the adults, thinking about dinner, a bottle of wine, were like, ‘Right, kids. Oh my God, the kids are totally right.’ So we went into the woods. Or some of us did.” “Who didn’t?” “Not saying. But you know who.” “She’s such an ass. Not you, hon. You had the little ones.” “I’m not going to drag them into the forest at night.” “No one expects you to.” “It was kind of awkward at first in the woods. Some of us were strangers. And, you know, only moments before our teams had been enemies.” “Opponents. Not enemies.” “Right. Opponents. But that changed. We had questions, like: Should we split up? Is that poison ivy? Who is she, anyway? And, you know, other questions. Some of us used the lights on our phones to see. Some had more woods experience and wanted the others to appreciate their superior scouting skills. They were, like, trying to track her. You know, the guys who grew up hunting. They were, like, looking for scat. I swear to God.” “I do not think she went into the woods to poop.” “We decided to split up, even though it was dark. But right before we split up, a mom from the other team asked very quietly, not wanting the others to hear, ‘Which way did she go?’ She only asked me, as if I knew or as if she wanted to go too.” “Did you find her?” “Some lookers plunged in. Some stayed near the edge, by the fields. Maybe they were scared they’d also get lost. Or annoyed that in order to look like a good person, they’d have to help out and be late for dinner. Some people probably slipped back out to the field, to their cars. Some were calling out, ‘Hello? Are you here?’ ” “Was she?” “I had the little ones.” “We know. We know. For Christ’s sake.” “I mean, I’d seen her enter the forest, but we got no answer. The woods are big. I can’t actually think of where those woods end.” “Do the woods end?” “I’ve never seen the end. Anyway. Forget it.” J looks around the kitchen, taking in the cabinetry for a moment. She places her hand flat on the table. “Yeah. Anyway. That’s it. A woman walked into the woods. We looked for her and eventually we gave up. We came back. Did you cut your bangs?” “You like?” “Super cute. I need a haircut too.” J pats the table again. J knows a woman who’s a famous artist. She and the woman had grown up together, childhood friends, but now it’s been years. J follows the woman’s career from a distance. It’s easy to, since the woman is often featured in fancy magazines or photographed wearing her uniform of gold-lamé shorts; wild, unwashed hair; leather straps; hairy pits; work boots; and makeup applied in surprising ways—say, three yellow lines across her forehead or a turquoise streak down each cheek. Sometimes the woman wears a soiled bridal veil with her gold shorts, though from what J can gather, the woman is not married. The woman bought an abandoned house in Detroit for $4,000. She moved into the crumbling manor with her posse. Yes, the woman has a posse, a jangly bunch of generally free spirits. Free until the woman issues a command, Fagin-style, as in: “Go get me a carved-oak dresser, an armful of red-berry branches, a petticoat, and a set of champagne stemware. And remember, I love you, babies.” A shopping list for the raw material of her art-making. The posse heads out to raid one of Detroit’s other fallen beauties that, because of various downturns in the economy, have been left unpeopled, unguarded, ostensibly abandoned. The posse slips into these homes under cover of darkness and makes short work of collecting treasures that belong to the families who own these decaying homes, or used to own them before the bank repossessed. It’s fuzzy. The woman’s posse, foragers of this misfortune, throw open attic chests, giddy with delight—thrilled with the beautiful trashlike detritus of the universe. They pile up old photo albums, yearbooks, and quilts. They return home laden with crystal dishes, phonograph cabinets, clarinets, cloches, cloaks, gold chains, religious icons, feathers, music boxes, jewels, lamps, and lipsticks. They return home with a sense that they are recycling items that would have gone to the landfill. They present these intimate signifiers of someone else’s life to their queen. Bees with knees full of pollen. On one hand, J thinks the woman’s project is cool. Property, after all, is a crime. But on the other hand, what the woman does is theft, plain and simple. No one says that. None of the articles mention that. In one of the houses, they found a check signed by Martin Luther King Jr. They brought the check home and the woman posted a picture of it on Instagram. J saw it. Maybe the check would have been destroyed if the posse hadn’t grabbed it. But still, there’s the grabbing. Or else, maybe J is just jealous of the woman. Maybe J wants a posse too. One that’s not made up of 8-year-olds, 4-year-olds. Maybe J would also like to be recognized for the things that make her totally wild. “Did you guys watch last night’s—” “Oh my God. So good. Love that show.” K’s picking the popcorn from her teeth. “Could you even believe it? She’s like, ‘Mister, I don’t even—’ ” “Shut up. I had to work late. Don’t spoil it.” “Oh, hon. You’re in for a treat.” “Don’t.” “Okay, okay.” “But I just couldn’t even believe when she—” “Wait. Can we get back to the woman?” “Who?” “The woman in the woods. You never found her? There’s, like, a woman at large in the woods somewhere and no one cares?” J looks reluctant, or guilty. “I walked farther into that forest than anyone.” “Were you scared?” “It was beautiful. Green and dark blue. I’d go back. There were some briars here and there but it smelled so good, I didn’t mind. That dirt smell. And there was something. The woods kept opening up more, like, Oh, there’s a clearing just over there, and then at the clearing, Oh, look, a small path, and then, Oh, what’s that up ahead? I kept walking and the woods kept opening.” “How long did you look?” “I’m not really sure.” “Well, I’d be pissed if I were you,” P says. “What the hell, right? She endangered all of you, leading you into the woods at night.” P is often angry. She has her reasons. We turn to look at her. “What about the woods scares you?” “I don’t know,” P says. “Trees?” “No.” “Dirt?” “No.” “Animals.” “Quit it.” “I’m more scared of an overwhelmed mom behind the wheel of a minivan.” P pinches her mouth. L tries to defuse any conflict. “Come on. We’ve all been there. Right? Late for something; no food in the house; tired, bratty kids; and you think, Maybe I should just 60-miles-an-hour into that tree. Right? You’ve all been there.” L laughs. Everyone looks at L. No one says a thing. The night after the woods, J fell into bed at nine. The artist and her posse were probably just waking up, ready to begin their bacchanals. Fire and costumes and sex. Dancing, touching, making something new from the possessions of the dispossessed. Is that wild? J wondered. Cities in decline? Postapocalypse? Humans behaving badly with lots of drugs? That doesn’t really seem wild, but maybe J would enjoy smearing her cheeks with odd colors and sneaking into her neighbors’ houses at night to steal their belongings and have sex with multiple partners, sometimes even multiple partners at the same time on a pile of stolen loot. It was wild growing humans inside her body. That was the most wildness J ever felt. And a posse of kids is wild. The other night J’s 4-year-old said, “Mama, my vagina’s singing.” And J asked, “What’s it singing about?” Her daughter didn’t miss a beat. “Pee.” Still, J is worried that wild mostly has nothing to do with humans, especially the grown-up ones. “The woods didn’t feel dangerous,” J says. “I liked it in the woods.” “You really weren’t scared?” “No. I even shut off my light and stood in the dark.” “What?” “Not me. No way.” “Everything felt soft. The trees were black. The sky had some blue left, like a painting, and it got quiet. People gave up and went home. People stopped calling for her. I mean, it’s not like she’s the sort of woman who’d come just because someone called her anyway.” “How do you know?” J shrugs. “Where were the kids?” “At the field. They were fine. They had a ball.” “How do you know? You were in the woods.” J smiles. “It got quieter the farther I went, and I liked it even more.” J looks like a person who’s telling a joke or a scary story, a person who knows something but won’t say it plainly. “I was like a girl with an excellent hiding place. You know that feeling?” “Yeah.” “Yeah.” “Yeah.” “Does she have children?” “Everyone asks that question. Why does that matter?” “It changes things. If her kids were there. If her kids were looking for her.” “She should behave because she’s a mother?” “She should be brave because she’s a mother.” “Walking into the woods is not brave?” “J.” “I really just want to know. I’m asking for real.” “Does she have a husband?” “I don’t know. We never found the woman.” “What?” “What happened to her?” “I don’t know. Eventually I made my way back to the fields. My kids were in the car. They didn’t even notice I’d been gone so long. We were the last to leave. Then there was no news about the woman, nothing in the papers. So I don’t know.” “Did you imagine her?” “Do 10, 12 people have the same dream?” “I don’t know.” “Maybe you just didn’t see her leave.” “Maybe. I was distracted.” “By what?” “Well, after a while, I could see in the dark.” “What’d you see?” “Nothing much. The dark.” J stops talking for a minute. “Anyway, enough. That’s it. That’s all that happened. Eventually I walked out of the woods.” “ ‘Enough’? You’re the one who keeps bringing it up.” P really is angry. “I guess I wonder if she’s still there.” “You can go back.” “Also, I’m jealous thinking that she might still be there.” “Jealous? She’d be dead.” “The woods are better off without us in them.” “Well, that night I thought I might belong there. Or I wanted to belong there.” “You can’t live in the woods. It rains. It snows. No coffee. The woods don’t want you.” “But I felt something there.” “Ah, you were scared.” “No. Something—sorry—divine.” “Divine like good?” “No. Divine like God.” The liberal mothers who hate religion look pained. “Jesus, J.” “Not him.” She smiles. “I just mean, holy crap. You felt God in the woods? What the fuck, girl?” “That’s not what I mean.” “Then what?” J shrugs. “I felt unhuman. After a while, I lay down.” “On the ground?” “The soil was so soft. I dug my fingers into it and it was like plugging into a socket. It was electrical. I don’t know what’s underneath that ground—microbes, mushrooms. But something crazy’s there.” “What do you mean unhuman?” “What’d the mushroom say, J?” “Is that a joke?” “I wondered how long before a body would disintegrate.” “I’m a real fungi. Get it?” K belches. Some mothers giggle. Some don’t. “You know D started microdosing?” “Everyone’s started microdosing.” “It wouldn’t take long for a body to become forest again,” J says. “Ick.” “I don’t know. What a way to go. Or to not go. To stay forever.” For the second time, the mothers look to see if the children can hear what’s being said. No curses, but a conversation that skirts precariously close to the most taboo topic: mother death. “Had you been drinking?” L tries to lighten things up again. “Not even a sip, hon.” “You sat down?” “I lay down. And to be honest,” J says, “it was hot. It was sexual. Like the way giving birth is sexual. An animal.” “Birth is sexual? I think I missed something.” “Oh Christ.” Now the conservative moms get to look pained. “You’re funny, J.” “I don’t mean to be.” “Then you shouldn’t tell people that about the trees. I mean, you can tell us, but—” “But no one wants to hear about a middle-aged mom having sex with a tree?” “Wait. You had sex with a tree?” “Maybe sex is the wrong word. Or else maybe the tree just wasn’t that into me.” “Huh?” “I think I mean decomposing.” “Rotting: the new sexy.” J smiles. “It’s definitely more intense than screwing. Rotting is wild.” “Is wild the point?” “I think so?” “Not me. I like baking cupcakes and watching Netflix.” “Me too.” “My cousin has a cabin in the mountains. You should rent it from her, J.” “I like hot baths.” “So do I,” J says. “I love hot baths.” “The woman disintegrated?” “I don’t know.” “I know you don’t know, but what do you think happened?” “Maybe she needed a hiding place. Maybe she did just need to poop. Or else the woods beckoned her. Maybe the woods needed her. She was watching the game and a leaf caught her eye and waved. Then suddenly a thousand new paths she’d never considered before seemed possible.” “Like what?” “I don’t know, but imagine this woman at Career Day.” J’s on the PTA. She’s a real leader, booking Career Day presenters for the high school, which is kind of funny since J doesn’t exactly have a career. “This woman could tell the kids something.” “What?” “I don’t know, something like ‘Listen, I do not give a fuck about soccer, kids. Honest,’ she’d say. ‘Us versus Them is bullshit. You’re more than little warriors.’ Maybe she’d even say, ‘Listen, I went into the woods. I lay down on the forest floor and became nutrients. And it was amazing, kids.’ Then she could give them a brochure: ‘How I became part of the forest.’ Then at least they’d know their options for real.” J pauses, takes a measure of the room. The mothers say nothing for a moment. “Are you the woman, J?” J shakes her head no. “I’m sorry?” A is uptight. Insecure. Righteous. She’s a fitness instructor. Also, she’s a Career Day presenter. Also, she’s a soccer coach. “Are you making a joke of this? This woman might have died. She might have been somebody’s mother.” We pause our chatter again. We have already lost some mothers here, and it is bad. The only thing worse than that is when we lose one of the children. “You think she harmed herself?” “There’d be a body if she had.” “Unless it disintegrated.” “It couldn’t do it that fast.” “ ‘It’?” A is really upset. “Please. Please,” J says. “I’m telling you something wonderful. Don’t make it dreary. Please. Come on.” “It sounds like you’re saying death is great. And I don’t think it is. It’s bleak and cold and it hurts us.” “It hurts the living.” “Yeah.” “Plus it sucks.” “Well, I just want to know if the woman is safe.” A’s got her hands on her hips. That sort of righteousness. “ ‘Safe’? What the fuck is that?” “I want to know she’s alive.” “Alive is safe?” “I just want her to stay a mom,” A says. “We all want that. I mean if she even was—is—a mom.” “You’re not thinking of hurting yourself, are you, J?” “I’m telling you something strange and beautiful is in the woods. God is in the forest. No. Wait. God is the forest. Or not God. Silence. Or—” “What the fuck, hon?” “I don’t know. Forget it. Forget I said anything. Please. I’ll be embarrassed tomorrow.” “No. I get it, J. No offense, L, nice party, but how many of these have you already been to this year?” J remains neutral, unsummarized. “I didn’t come back from the forest because my kids were waiting. I came back because look: cabinets, doors, floors. You don’t have to walk into the woods to know the forest. IKEA, motherfuckers.” “But this wood’s dead.” “Yeah. And you’re not scared of it. You don’t hate it for dying. We should be more like the wood.” “Less separate with life and death. I feel like I’m keeping a dirty little secret all the time, trying to hide something. Then, someone gets sick and it’s like, oh shit, it’s her fault she’s going to die. She did something wrong. Not enough moisturizer or exercise or something.” The mothers look stricken. “Are you sick, J?” “No. I don’t know.” “Then what are you talking about?” J nods. “Forget it,” she says again. “Forget it.” Some of the mothers pull their phones from their purses to have a look at the news of the world. The kitchen’s quiet. The dead wood of the cabinets and tables just sits there. Finally, one woman puts down her phone and speaks up. “I’m going to root for being alive over being dead. Sorry, J. I like it here. I want to stay here, as a human. Soccer, dinner, cupcakes, all of it.” “Yeah.” “Yeah.” “Yeah. Go, team.” “You guys, I’m not rooting for death,” J says. “I want to stay alive so much, I can’t sleep at night trying to hold on to it. I’m just telling you that in the forest, the dead stuff in the ground wasn’t dead. It was living. It was both. Dead and alive at the same time. It was making the trees grow and it was—” “Wait. Wait.” L, hostess without end, tries to make nice again. Smooth, sane, polite, safe gossip. “But what happened to the woman? Does anyone know? Should we go look? Maybe she’s there, hurt. Maybe we just—” “Oh wait. I know what happened to her,” P says, a new thought dawning across her face. “You do?” “Were you there?” “No. But I know what happened.” “You weren’t even there, P.” “You saw a ghost, J.” “Huh.” “Or a zombie. Like on the show last night. For real.” “Don’t tell me. I haven’t watched it yet.” “I’m serious. It’s the only explanation that makes sense. You saw a woman go into the woods and never come out. Why did she have no car? Why did she have no kids?” “Why?” “Because she’s dead.” “Or maybe she just likes the woods. Maybe she didn’t want to have kids.” “Stop.” “And you were walking right into her trap, J. How do we know you’re not dead too?” “I am dead too. That’s what I’m trying to tell you, dead and alive.” “So she got you? She bit you? That’s why you’re acting so weird.” “No. I never even saw her in the woods. Are you listening?” “Oh God.” “Stop.” “I’m serious. Maybe J just hasn’t started to decay yet. When did you say this happened?” “Stop. You’re scaring me.” “I’ve definitely started to decay. You have too, P.” “You’re scaring me.” “Well maybe we should be scared.” P grabs J’s wrist, trying to feel for a pulse. “Really?” J asks. “It’s just like the show. No one knew she was a zombie until she ate all their brains.” “Fuck! You just ruined the one highlight of my week. She ate them all?” “Or maybe the woman did come out of the woods again. Came out of the woods dead. She could be anywhere. She could be walking among all of the kids right now, coming to Career—” The doorbell rings. “Shit!” The mothers jump. “It’s just the door,” L says. “Don’t answer it.” “Are you serious?” “Didn’t you watch?” “Don’t answer the door, L.” Then a firm knock. The mothers listen from the kitchen. L tries to crane her neck to see through the window. “It might be the new girl’s mom. I have to let her in.” “No you don’t.” “Yeah you do.” “What if she’s dead?” “Open the door, L. This is absurd.” “Yeah.” “Stop.” “Please don’t.” One mother unwraps a cupcake, takes a large bite. “Don’t.” “Are you kidding me?” “Please.” “Open the door.” “You have to.” “Yeah, you do,” J says. “Even if she is dead.” “Jesus, J! Stop it. I’m not going to sleep for weeks. Please.” L approaches the door. A handful of the mothers shrink in their seats. “Open the door,” J says. “Open all the doors.” “Shit. Hold up. Hold up,” A says. “The kids are coming.” “The kids are coming? Fuck. Don’t open the door.” “Are you okay, J? Everybody good?” “I’m fine. Yeah.” “You sure?” “I’m fine.” “Don’t open that door.” “Here come the kids. Ah, Christ. Goody bags. Sorry, L.” L slows her approach toward the door. Her hand nears the knob. “I swear I only put in healthy snacks and some erasers. Oh, and a Ring Pop. And Tootsie Rolls. And a water pistol. Everybody all right?” “Don’t open the door.” L pauses in the foyer. “Hello?” She lifts her hand to the door as if to touch the thing on the other side, to know it without having to open to it. Only it doesn’t work that way. The wood of the door reveals nothing. And L, inside the house, knows nothing of outsides. L touches the knob. “I’m fine,” J says in the kitchen. “I probably have the story wrong, anyway. The sun set so no one saw the woman come back, find her things—you know, her keys, her phone, her kids. No one saw her drive home in the dark. That’s how you want the story to end, right?” The mothers watch L at the door. “Right,” one of them says. “Sure. Shhh. Here come the kids.” “Right. Shut the fuck up. Here come the kids.”"

        "story": "The women were drinking peach schnapps, telling stories about the worst things they’d ever done. They had already skimmed through the missing years in haste, as though the past were gruesome, the two decades of lost friendship something untouchable and rotten. Maybe it was, Nic thought. Melodie had said she was a real-estate agent in San Luis Obispo, still playing the field. Her face was so artificially plumped and frozen that it resembled a Greek-chorus mask that had slid between genres and settled on tragicomedy. Sammie was overripe, a bruised apple. Five kids with Hank, she had said with a sigh, all seven of them packed into the little house her mother had left her, in the same little town where the women had all grown up. Birdie was dying, the reason they’d all been summoned. She had only her friends and her parents these days, because she had been a freelancer, working alone, and her boyfriend had taken off at the first diagnosis, stealing the cat. Only Nic was the same as she’d been when they’d last seen her, just a little more droopy and wrinkled now—a law professor, one kid, divorced, chunky jewelry, the whole shebang. In this room, she was hyperaware of how boring her life was, but also that she was the one who was clearly managing the best. A surprise; fortune favoring the brittle. Snow hissed against the window. The hospital moved in its mechanical intricacy behind the door. The three old friends were perched near Birdie, who lay pale and skinny from the neck down, though her face was unreal in its puffiness, as if covered by a floppy creature sucking on the bones of her skull. Only those darting blue-black eyes were hers. Melodie was now saying that the worst thing she had ever done was at an awful party she’d catered in the hills, just after some bigwig cornered her in the pantry and touched her under her skirt. I threw a bottle of olive oil at his head and burst out into the dining room, she said. And then I realized that I no longer had to take any of this shit, and that I was done trying to charm this room full of rich people, and for what? A nonspeaking part in a movie never released in theaters and a cruddy little efficiency with a rodent problem way out in Encino? No, thank you. So I stole a $20,000 mink out of the coatroom and took off. I don’t even feel bad, because I’m like, if you have $20,000 to park in a coatroom, you have $20,000 to throw away on me. And I still have it in my closet. I mean, it’s ugly as sin. But sometimes when I’m sad I get naked and wear it, fur side in, and I feel at peace with my life decisions for, like, a hot minute. They laughed, and then Sammie said in a sort of fast whisper that her worst thing ever was terrible and they were all going to hate her if she said it. And when they said, No, no, Sammie, come on, she got tears in her eyes and admitted quaveringly that she’d had an abortion. That’s your worst thing ever? Melodie said. Christ, Sammie, I’ve had two abortions and I feel great about them. We don’t need to let men spawn in our bodies. I’ve had one too, Birdie said. A quarter of the women in this country have them. Abortion’s morally neutral, I think. I’ve had three, said Nic, who hadn’t even had one, but solidarity seemed the right call in this scenario. Always one-upping us, Nic, Melodie said with a smile that, on her frozen face, was all teeth. A series of emotions passed over Sammie’s face, but she finally settled into a large, tight solemnity, and they could see her judging them from behind it. Then the women were all looking at Nic, so she took a swig of schnapps and steeled herself and said, The worst thing I ever did was, I guess, what happened that summer just after we graduated, right before we all left home. I was babysitting for a couple who lived out on the lake, about six miles north of town. They worked at the opera. He was a set designer and she did costumes. She was about to go into the whole story—the delicious old winterized camp that was painted a green-black, and its crisp white modern interior, the husband and wife like sleek seals, the toddler she loved like her own child, who slept with his hands curled near his ears—when she saw the other three exchanging looks and repressing their smiles, and that old whip of their judgment snapped out of the darkness of time and stung her. Nic cried out, What? What? Oh my God, Melodie said. We were right. We totally knew it. We totally knew you were having an affair with the little boy’s father. That’s actually why we stopped talking to you, Sammie said. We were so mad at you! You sexy little home-wrecker! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Birdie put her swollen, dry hand on Nic’s and said, I am sorry about the way we treated you. You were just a kid, not even 18. And we were so cruel to you that summer. We’re so sorry. You were cruel to me? Nic said. I had no idea. I just thought we were all busy that summer and couldn’t hang out. There was a long pause before Melodie said, Well, I mean, we three hung out. We just never called you. You were kind of persona non grata. We called you Nick-hole. Yikes, Nic said. Wow. I mean, in our defense, kids are pretty morally rigid, you know? Sammie said. I mean, it wasn’t right, what you did, or anything, but we definitely should have been nicer to you or, like, made some kind of attempt to understand or whatever. I mean, my oldest is only a few years away from that age, and I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure she’s having sex? Probably not with married men, but who knows anymore? She doesn’t tell me anything, and all these kids have this whole separate life online nowadays. Oh God! she cried, and looked off into the distance, blinking. Nic tried to remember feeling left out and lonely that summer, but all that returned to her now was a kind of fullness, a warmth and smoothness and a sharpening of all the beauty that had surrounded her until the pressure inside her became so intense, she could hardly recognize anything beyond the confines of her own body. That summer still dazzled her with its light. She hadn’t even noticed her friends ignoring her; she had been too happy within herself. In any case, we’re sorry, Birdie said. Her breathing had tightened and her eyes had narrowed to slits; she was clearly in pain, and she fumbled for a button and pressed it with urgency. They all watched, helpless before the enormity of their old friend’s suffering, but soon the drugs washed into Birdie and she smiled again. Anyway, the worst thing I ever did is something I think about all the time, Birdie said. This is why I asked the question. When we were in middle school, there was this friend of mine who would come over to my house to escape a pretty awful situation at home. There was a lot of that in our town, Melodie said. An entire town made out of bad situations. Still is, Sammie said. The stories I could tell! Just give me another drink and I will, she said, and she gulped the schnapps and coughed, but before she could give them the gossip, Birdie said quickly, Anyway, I both liked and didn’t like this girl. There was this extreme sweetness but also such awkwardness, it made me want to run away or cringe or lock the door and pretend not to be home whenever I saw her walking up the hill to my house. And my parents kind of knew what was going on at my friend’s house, so even though they were super strict usually, they let us have all the sleepovers we wanted. At one point my friend shared this pretty heavy secret. I kept it for a little while, like a year or so, but then one night, out of some kind of irritation—I think I had wanted to go to someone else’s house for a birthday party but couldn’t because I had to have a sleepover with this little hanger-on who just seemed so drippy and lame that night—I became furious. So I got up in the middle of the night and wrote an anonymous letter to my friend’s parents, telling them everything that I knew about their daughter. And the punishment was severe—like, the parents would be called by child protective services nowadays, it was so bad—and after that there were no more sleepovers, not for a long time. The worst part was that my friend never even blamed me for it. But I saw that some of the light inside her had dimmed. I knew that I was the one who had done it. And you can’t get that innocence back. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. I couldn’t forgive myself. I still haven’t. Birdie’s mouth had gone dry and she was making clicking noises. Lauren Groff: L. Debard and Aliette, a short story Oh, you need to forgive yourself, Sammie said gravely. Holding grudges is where cancer comes from. They all looked at Sammie, who seemed confused at the sudden attention; the wind shrieked against the side of the building. The door opened and a doctor stepped in. He was good-looking in a wispy, middle-aged-runner kind of way, and Melodie’s face became alert. What do we have here? he said. Birdie’s bevy? The cancer cabal, Nic said, and the doctor flicked his eyes at her in recognition: another joker in the room. Birdie introduced each woman and said, In high school, we called ourselves the E’s. Our names all end in i-e. The doctor looked at Nic and said, But not Nic, and she said, Nope. They tried to call me Nickie but I would never answer to it, and they finally gave up. So, Nic and the E’s, he said. A bad cover band. Nice to meet you. I regret to tell you, he said, putting his hand on Birdie’s shoulder, it is time to say goodnight. Birdie needs her rest. You all can come back to visit in the morning—9 a.m. sharp. The women stood, feeling unbalanced, and one by one they kissed Birdie’s swollen cheek, unconsciously holding their breath, as though not to take her pain into their bodies. They grabbed their roller bags from where they’d parked them in the corner and fled the room. There was more air in the hallway, or they could breathe now, and they relaxed a little as they walked. I took a cab here, said Melodie. Me too, said Sammie. Nic sighed internally and said, I rented a car. I’ll drive us to the hotel. In the hospital’s lobby, they stopped to look out the enormous windows into the wildness of wind and snow, and it seemed so astonishingly huge and fearsome, some dark beast roaring at them, that nobody moved until Nic reluctantly said, I’ll go out and get the car and pull it up here for you. Both of the other women said, Great, thanks! Nic felt a shock of pain in immersing herself in such cold. Then again, after seeing Birdie in her bed, it seemed right to be scoured by ice and darkness, to be stripped back to the animal body. Nic wanted to cry, and obligingly the wind bit at her eyes and made them water, then froze the tears to the corners of her eyes. The rental car smelled like plastic and sadness, and she put the heat on full blast and drove back to the entrance, where the women were waiting in the warmth and the golden light. They threw their bags into the trunk and climbed in, shivering. Nic moved slowly through the parking lot and out onto the highway, filled with snowbanks and the brave little red taillights of other cars, barely visible before her. Where tires had worn the ice down to the black asphalt, the wind of the passing cars was blowing snow in writhing snakes that the headlights caught, making them glow. It was hypnotic to watch. The other two women were talking, but Nic was driving carefully and barely listening until Melodie turned to her said, You’re awfully quiet, Nic. Ignoring us? Just trying to keep us alive, she said. Is that some kind of joke? Sammie said. Because Birdie is dying? Because if it is, it isn’t funny. No, I’m literally trying to keep the wind from swerving us into a semitruck in this miserable fucking blizzard, Sammie, Nic said. Oh, Sammie said, and started to weep. Sorry. I’m just really on edge all the time these days. I can’t even tell you how much I needed this weekend. The two other women tried not to smile at this, until Melodie gave up and snorted, and Sammie said defensively, Wait, I know how that sounded, and it wasn’t what I meant. I know this isn’t, like, a girls’ weekend at a spa or whatever, but you try having five children. Never, Melodie said. Kill me first. One child sometimes seems like too much for me, Nic said, and thought of her weird little girl a thousand miles away, falling asleep right now to whale song. Instead of being with her, Nic had chosen to be here, handmaiden to death, reliving high school with these so-called friends of hers she wasn’t sure she’d liked even in their heyday. Birdie had been the good queen to Melodie’s wicked one; Sammie had been the rook, stout and square and locked into her rigid right angles; and what was Nic? The knight. Leaping around in panic, edging in from the side. There had been no pawns—or rather, the entire rest of the world had been pawns, disposable and in the way. Why was she making chess metaphors? She hadn’t played chess in decades. She had never felt more exhausted in her life. The lights of their hotel slid up the windshield, and they parked as close to the glass doors as they could. They dragged their bags through the snow and inside. A plate of fresh hot cookies sat at the hotel desk. While they waited, Sammie took three. Meet in my room at seven for drinks, ladies! she said at the elevator through a mouthful of cookie, but Nic begged off, saying she would have to call her daughter, though this was a lie. Her daughter was already dreaming, far away. For a long time, she sat on the side of the bed in the hotel robe, weary, letting the light of home-renovation shows on the television wash over her. She called down to reception for room service, but the nice girl named Dagmar, who’d checked them in, laughed at her. What you take this place for, the Ritz? No room service. Is the restaurant, pizza delivery. But through this big storm, eh, she said doubtfully. Dagmar, Nic said, if I have to spend any more time with the women I came with, I will go absolutely bonkers. Understand, Dagmar said. Blond one is in the bar talking now to the businessmen and drinking pink wine. And, oof, now here comes pretty one out of elevator. Pretty one? Nic said. No, correct, not pretty, Dagmar said diplomatically. Sexy one. I do not understand these fat lips. Like a duck, no? How to speak with duck lips? Oh, they’re not made like that for talking, Nic said. They laughed, and then Dagmar said, Listen, they sit now beyond the bar. You sneak in on other side, you sit far from your friends, in shadows behind a wall. All I can say. Perfect, Nic said, and hung up. Nic dressed again, in all black, like a ninja, and pulled her hair back severely. She slipped in the way that Dagmar had said and hid behind her menu. When Dagmar came over from the desk to take her order, she laughed. You look like spy, she said. You have to be a waitress too, Dagmar? You’re a woman of great capabilities, Nic said. Is only three workers who come in the storm. We share jobs, Dagmar said with a shrug. She had applied a pale-pink lip gloss that made her mouth seem almost unseemly in its wetness. Nic looked away. Just give me your cheapest bottle of red wine and your fastest meal to go, she said, and the girl, deflated, sped off. As Nic waited, she heard Melodie and Sammie talking on the other side of the bar, but couldn’t make out their words. At last, the four businessmen who’d been chatting with them stood and threw down their money and went back up to their rooms. Now only a few people were left in the bar, all loners, and the women’s voices came clear. I’m, like, really worried about her, Sammie was saying, blurry with alcohol. She seems bad. Like, poor thing! Nic smiled, because a person dying of cancer could certainly be called a poor thing. Right? She seems so unhappy that it just, like, radiates off her, Melodie said. She was never so dour and grim and jumpy when we were young, right? She was the kind of kid who was always telling goofy jokes and doing things to make other people happy. I was so jealous of how she got all the good parts in the plays! And she didn’t even want to be an actress; I did. How bad must her life be to, like, emanate such hatred toward everyone? Thank goodness she at least has her daughter, Sammie said, and this is how Nic knew for sure they weren’t talking about Birdie. One of the men at the bar took his gently chiming bourbon over to the women and said, Ladies, would you mind terribly if I bought you a drink?, and Sammie’s giggle was so delighted, Nic could see how her night would unroll, how starved she was for exactly this kind of adventure. Nic grabbed the soup and wine that Dagmar held out to her, signed the room-charge slip with a ludicrous tip for the girl, and scuttled off, her heart going fast in her rage. Her life was unhappy? The other two were so desperate for love that one mutilated her face and the other couldn’t stop pumping out babies. Back in the room, she burned her tongue on Dagmar’s soup, and finally she cried and cried, for her poor burnt tongue, for her poor lost youth, for poor Birdie, who had once been so pale and tall and slender and redheaded that she’d reminded Nic of a lit candle. Just before nine, as she was drifting off to sleep, the hotel phone rang, and Nic picked it up, thinking of her daughter, catastrophe, a house on fire, but it was Dagmar. A little pulse stirred in Nic’s gut and then Dagmar said, Your friends, they make me call. They say, Ask if is all right? So I ask. My best friend is days from death, I’m stuck in a mid-range hotel in a blizzard, hiding from the two biggest bitches known to man, and I’ve already seen this episode, so obviously I’ve never been better, Nic said. She heard Dagmar say, Being sarcastic, seems fine. Then, to Nic, They say meet for breakfast at eight in the a.m. Sleep came crashing down on Nic, and she woke with a dry mouth at six to find that the wind had abated and the sky was going pink over a field swept white with fresh-whipped snow. She considered going to the gym, but was sure she’d find Melodie there, refining the beautiful muscles of her body. Instead she lay in the clean, giant bed, luxuriating in the silence and calm. Her daughter would have been awake for an hour already, and would now be tapping Nic’s face or making the music robot play that same damn song about sharks that all the children were obsessed with and dancing around the room, saying, I’m starving! Feed me! until Nic got up and made her eggs. She watched the clock slip forward until she was afraid she wasn’t ever going to get up. But at the last minute she took a swift shower and packed her things, and was at the wan buffet of hard-boiled eggs and assorted packaged carbohydrates before the other two women. She drank a coffee and ate an apple with peanut butter. Dagmar had been replaced by a stout man with a busy expression, and Nic laughed at herself a little for feeling disappointed. The elevator opened to Melodie, her makeup perfect, moving in a haze of perfume so strong that Nic imagined the ficus trees in the lobby wilting as she passed. She looked at the buffet with a grimace and took a black coffee, and sat down opposite Nic. But instead of saying something mean, as the old Melodie would have, she put a hand on the table palm side up, and looked at Nic until Nic put her own hand in hers. At the touch, Melodie’s eyes filled with tears that slowly fell down the taut skin of her face, and Nic lost her appetite, and had to close her eyes and breathe. When she opened them, Sammie had arrived, and was holding a bowl of sugar cereal, her eyes darting back and forth between the other women’s faces. Melodie blotted her cheeks with a napkin and sighed, then squinted at Sammie and said, Is that a hickey? Sammie turned a lurid pink and said, No!, but Melodie had already unzipped her makeup case from her bag and was dabbing the bruise with a wand of concealer. Don’t tell, Sammie said. Oh my gosh, you can’t tell. It’s just that—I just needed something. I just needed something, anything else in my goddamn little old life. What is there to tell? Nic said. Your neck ran into a doorknob. Plus, you know, your body, your choice, Melodie said. You two are such jerks, Sammie said with admiration. The highways were plowed and clear of cars, and they were so early for visiting hours that they went to the cafeteria and got more coffee, which was surprisingly good. When they went up to Birdie’s floor, Birdie looked worse, and if Nic had been a superstitious woman, she might have said that behind Birdie’s shoulder, death had taken another vulture-step nearer. The doctor came by briefly and squeezed Nic’s shoulder as he left them for his other patients. Melodie clocked the gesture and grimaced, but Nic would have given him to Melodie if she could have; she had no need for a moderately good-looking doctor a thousand miles away from her life. They chatted about nothing, about people from the town who had ceased to be real to most of them decades ago, and Sammie glowed as she spoke, and Melodie painted Birdie’s nails a color she called Whore Red. It was finally time for the others to leave. Nic could have gone to the airport a few hours early to deliver the other two in time for their flights, but she was finished—finally, for good—with trying to please people she didn’t care about. She said maybe it would be best if the other two shared a cab. Sammie hugged them all, and sat with Birdie and kissed her temple and whispered something long and fervent, weeping. Melodie squeezed Birdie’s hands, and when she turned to Nic she said, in a quick, low tone, If we both keep mellowing out, I think we’ll be the best of friends when we’re 90. Oh good, Nic said. Let’s make plans to meet up then. Melodie barked a laugh and hugged Nic, forcing her perfume into her nose, and said, Don’t worry, I see through all the crustiness. I know you’re a softy deep down. And then the women were gone. Alone now, Nic and Birdie smiled at each other, and Nic kicked off her shoes. She lay down next to her friend and put her head on Birdie’s pillow. All those years were a canyon between them, the lost years when they spoke on the phone only twice a month; the other years were shot through with blazing intensity. Though their bodies were touching, there was no way to leap back to the other side. I realized, Birdie said, we never actually let you tell your story yesterday. No, Nic laughed. Your version was kind of imposed on me. I’ve been thinking all night about your story. It didn’t happen the way we said, did it? Birdie said. I could tell when you started to wear that sly look of yours. You were going to let us live with the wrong idea. I guess I realized I didn’t want Melodie or Sammie to have my story, Nic said. It felt too precious to give to them. But to me? Birdie said. You know I’d give you anything, Nic said. Please do, Birdie said. Nic took a deep breath, and she told Birdie the long version of the story, parceling out all the details she’d so savored these years. She had met Richard and Deanna at the farmers’ market the weekend after she’d graduated from high school, she told Birdie. She was selling her father’s flowers. Gladioluses, that week. Red and yellow and pink. They’ve always seemed wildly sexual, nearly embarrassing, since then. Then the couple walked in, and they were unmistakably alien, shining and beautiful, both dark-haired, in sunglasses, which in that town was seen as an affectation. Each held a hand of their little boy, swinging him between them, and he laughed, slightly hysterical. Already, without knowing him, Nic loved him for his sweetness, his sharp little face. She crouched and handed him the tip of a yellow gladiolus that had broken off, and he took it with a scream of delight, and when she stood again, the parents had taken off their sunglasses and were looking at her. She had never been looked at so minutely or with such interest. Later, she understood that they looked at all the world as though they were eating it up and it was the most delicious thing they’d ever tasted—that it wasn’t just her, that they were interested in everything, they were artists—but at the time she felt all parts of her body tingling. They were in town for the summer festival up at the opera house, they said. They were looking for a babysitter. Well, that’s interesting, she said. I’m looking for a job, and she felt her blush rising hot out of the neck of her T-shirt, up her jawline, into her cheeks. She already had a job lined up at a baseball-cap store, but it was minimum wage and not the kind of thing she felt, even then, was worthy of her. They looked delighted and said they would give her $10 an hour, which was twice her normal babysitting rate, and for only one little boy. She scrawled her address and phone number on a slip of newspaper, and they said they would pick her up on Monday morning at eight. Read: Lauren Groff on writing with lightness After the farmers’ market closed and her father had collected the money and the leftover flowers, she went to the computers in the library and looked the couple up. This was the dawn of the internet, when information on everyone was scarce, but she did discover that both were well known in their fields, and she printed out blurry photos of them, which she kept in her nightstand at home. She didn’t sleep at all that Sunday night. The car that came up the lane on Monday was a gray Jaguar, so beautiful that she felt unworthy of riding in it. Richard was dressed in a tight navy polo shirt that surprised her; it seemed too preppy for an artist to be wearing. As he drove, he turned to smile at her. They loved this area, he said. They’d been coming since college, and just last year had bought an old wreck of a camp and hired men to fix it up over the winter. This was their first summer living there, and so far, only three days in, they adored it. The old camp was a stunning hunter green in morning light and black in the shadows of the afternoon. It was set on a small peninsula of land so that views of the lake filled its three windows. When she was inside she felt as though she was standing in water. They had kept the wooden interior, but painted it white and removed walls, opening it up into a great, vaulted downstairs room with a kitchen, bathroom, and master bedroom beneath the upstairs, where the little boy’s room, a bathroom, and a guest room were. She had never before been in a place where every detail had been carefully selected, from the blown-glass light fixtures, to the handmade wrought-iron cabinet pulls, to the walnut furniture her parents would have called ugly but that looked ravishingly sculptural to her on the bare wooden floors. When she walked in that first time, she felt the way she had when she was little and walked into church on Sunday, before her logic caught up with God. Deanna hugged her, smelling like lotion and also like the lake from her morning swim. She was in a sheer black-linen dress, and had saved cinnamon pancakes for Nic. The little boy climbed into Nic’s lap as though she were his old friend. Deanna had written out the boy’s schedule and now gave her the keys to their Volvo. Then the couple kissed the little boy and left together in the Jaguar. Nic was so happy to be in this house—with its delicious food, its cleanliness and quiet and books—and to have the lake to explore all day. She felt strange, alone with the little boy in the house: She was the 18-year-old misfit ready to leave this tiny part of the country but frightened of the world, and at the same time she was her future self, living her own ideal life, in this quiet and peace with her child and her beautiful things all around her—a place where people treated one another with gentleness, and there was no sudden danger, no violence, no sharpness. On good days, Nic said now to Birdie, whose eyes were blinking rapidly in her swollen face, my life is not that far from this early vision of it. It’s funny that even then, I didn’t see a partner in the picture, she said, laughing. Birdie pressed her hand and she went on. On Friday of the first week, Richard drove her home as usual, but her parents were having one of their parties, and the lane was full of trashy cars, and he couldn’t park until way down the block. She must have sighed or something, and he turned to her and said, Are you going to be okay? I think so, Nic said, but she had tears in her eyes. She could cope with her family, with any test thrown her way, with the bitchiness of high-school girls and the meatheadedness of high-school boys, but when any adult outside her family asked her if she was doing well, she always wept. And then the next second, Richard was leaning over the stick shift and kissing her. She’d been kissed by boys, but never by a man, and from the first time she had seen Richard, he had stirred something in her. But also, Nic said to Birdie, girls were different then. She was trying to raise her own daughter so that she’d sock a grown married man who did something like that, but she had been conditioned to want to please men. With real lust and hunger to please, she kissed him back. And it felt disgusting, as though she was a bad person—because even after only a week, she loved Deanna—but, Nic said now, oh, Birdie, it was so unbelievably hot. I bet, Birdie said. You were unbelievably hot then. They laughed, and Nic said, So that’s how it began. Never before work, but usually after, and sometimes he’d come back to the house during the little boy’s nap. It was like every part of me had just woken up. All my nerves, all my perceptions, even my sense of taste. A tomato was no longer just a tomato but something much bigger and more beautiful. Every hour of the day and night was nearly unbearable in its depth. Every time I saw Deanna, I felt such tremendous grief, because I knew what I was doing. I understood that I was harming her. And then one day, Nic said, she heard the Jaguar come up the drive to the camp during the little boy’s nap, and her body responded. But Deanna, not Richard, walked in the door. Nic was pretending to read on the couch, and Deanna looked at her for a long time from the doorway, wearily, then smiled and said she had wanted to swim so badly, she just took off from her meeting and came home. Then she tossed a bathing suit at Nic and grabbed one herself and said, Come on. Nic was pretty sure Deanna was going to lead her out into the middle of the lake to drown her, but she went along because deep down she knew that she deserved it. They swam out far, but not so far that they wouldn’t be able to hear the baby monitor on the dock, and Deanna turned to Nic, and Nic bowed her head, waiting for harsh and unforgiving words or hands pressing down on her head. Then she kissed me, Nic said. Birdie gasped. I mean, I saw it coming, she said, but damn. In retrospect, here was a 35-year-old woman whose husband was obviously sleeping with a child, and here was a way to try to become the master of the whole situation. On the other hand, the kiss was the most beautiful Nic had ever had in her life. And it awoke that old sleeping thing in you, Birdie said quietly. It did, Nic said. And then I essentially moved into their guest room. The next two months, with both of them, and the little boy to sweeten the whole day, were the very happiest of my life. I think if there is such a thing as heaven, I would be returned to those months in an endless loop. Waiting at night in that bed, trembling when there was a step on the staircase, not knowing who the step belonged to, breathless to see, wanting both of them at the same time, always feeling inordinately confused and yet constantly in a kind of rush of wind. But then the time ran out, and I said goodbye and went off to school. I left everything behind, my entire previous life, the town and my friends and these people I loved so much. I didn’t mourn for any of it, because you can’t mourn for a dream. But I did find out that they separated later. That’s the worst thing I did, driving those good parents apart. Making their little boy sad. They thought in silence for a while, and then Birdie slowly said, It’s funny. Now I think you wouldn’t have been able to see us that summer even if we’d wanted you to. I think I knew all about what was going on, deep down, and it drove me a little crazy. I know you know that it came from me, the ostracizing. Not Melodie or Sammie. It was me. I was murderous with jealousy, I think. I know, Nic said. Of that couple, though. For having you, Birdie said. I know, Nic said. What I think I’m trying to say is that I’m sorry for what I did to you. I’m sorry I wrote that letter to your parents in middle school and that your dad—well, I’m sorry that he hurt you. I’m sorry we couldn’t be friends the same way, not even in high school. I’m sorry I killed that beautiful thing in you for so long. Birdie was crying, but Nic laughed a little and said, Oh, Bird, it’s okay. I was a drippy little hanger-on back then. And it’s not like we really knew what we were doing to each other in your My Little Pony sleeping bag, anyway. It was all kind of abstract, right? It just felt good. And I definitely agreed back then with everyone—with my God, and your God, and my parents, and with you after you wrote that letter about how perverted I was—that there was and would always be something grotesque in me for wanting to have sex with literally every human being I saw. Only when I met Richard and Deanna did I understand that it could be good. Birdie said, Tell me you forgive a dying woman. Nothing to forgive, but I forgive you, Nic said. I forgave you the moment you sent the letter. You were 13. Everyone’s an asshole at 13. I forgave you in high school when we were finally friends again and you kissed me at Lucky Smith’s party and then turned around and hooked up with Lucky. Of course I forgive you now. There was a knock, and Birdie’s parents came in, wan in their snow-dusted peacoats. Their one night off from their daughter’s deathbed, the true reason for the friends’ visit, had obviously been spent in lamentation. Nic hugged them and backed away, because with them here, the past was too heavy. Not even a week later, Birdie’s mother would call with the news, and Nic would thank her and clutch the phone to her ear long after the call ended, unable to move in the waves of grief and rage, until slowly the grief faded away, and only the rage remained. Because she hadn’t lied to Birdie; she had in fact forgiven her friend. But the friend she had forgiven was that unspeakably swollen, nearly dead woman in the hospital, and also the young Birdie of the silky, warm skin so close to her own in the sleeping bag on the green-shag carpet of her room, the taste of her in Nic’s mouth, the happiness between them. There were only two forgivable Birdies. All the Birdies in between, all those bitches, still had something to answer for. In the hospital, Nic had stayed on and on until she looked at the clock and saw that she should have left long ago. She kissed Birdie on the cheek lingeringly so that she could remember the warmth of her, then flew through the halls of the sick and the suffering, drove wildly to the airport, threw the keys at the rental-car valet, and bolted to the gate. She rose into the flight, that gorgeous liminal moment that is a respite between lives, and descended again into the grind of the quotidian, collecting her daughter from her estranged husband’s house, opening the briefcase full of first-year family-law papers, identifying the strange stink as emanating from the garbage, ignoring the desiccated peas on the kitchen tiles, the bills, the attention-hungry cat that wouldn’t stop rubbing herself against Nic’s ankle. She sat up at her desk and did not work, but pretended to, and felt the cat circling and circling and pressing herself into Nicole’s skin, as though to tell her what words could not, as though these poor mortal bodies of theirs were ever nearly enough to express the terrible depths of love."
