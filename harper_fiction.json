        "story": "I had joined the conference participants on a hike to a local Naga cave, guided by Gail and Horace, a married couple from Sarah Lawrence. At first, they took the lead, but when Horace turned beet red and gasped for air, they fell back, and Donald and I led the group. The way was mostly flat—sometimes grassy and open, sometimes wooded. It looked like any pine forest, except for the one- or two-story boulders resting beside the path as if set there by giants. Donald wore photochromatic glasses that had been blue-black in the bright sunlight but lightened to a smoky gray on the wooded path. He asked me about my son. I told him Trip would be a junior in high school in the fall, that he was interested in astronomy and video games. I went quiet then, not wanting to mention that he refused to go to school, that our relationship was strained. I didn’t tell him that Trip was mildly autistic, because I found that saying so often made people uncomfortable. If they didn’t know much about the subject, they generally didn’t know what to say, which I didn’t mind, but other times, they decided to charge boldly ahead, and said things that were upsetting. Thinking all this over, I kind of dropped the ball on the conversation with Donald and left him hanging. We walked in comfortable silence. Behind us, some of the academics were talking about Robert Pattinson. “The person I’m touching turns, and I’m eye to eye with him.” “Who?” “A famous young actor. He says, ‘Can I order for you? Do you want something to drink?’ and my mind goes blank—just nothing.” “I’d faint if he tried to buy me a drink.” “Didn’t he jack off as Dalí?” a woman asked. “What?” “I think he was in a movie as Dalí and masturbated on camera or something.” “I’ve got to see that. Remind me to have a look.” “He doesn’t drink, right?” “It was 2017, so to be honest I do think he was still drinking at that time—not that it really matters. The point is, the lips move, and the words come out of my mouth: ‘I’ll have the Pappy Van Winkle.’” The man laughed. When no one else responded, he explained. “It was kind of a strange thing to order. In addition to being exorbitantly expensive and served in a snifter... it just wasn’t the right thing in the moment.” Farther back, I heard someone talking about a pigeon and Mount Everest, something to do with a silk scarf in its claws. Donald and I glanced at each other. He smiled. We had walked for more than an hour when we came to the sadhus. They sat beside a mud hut, quietly watching us. One was naked, with broad horizontal strokes of white ash smudged across his forehead and a large enamel pin in his topknot. Something in his manner seemed to ask what impression he made. The other wore a T-shirt and a sarong printed with marijuana leaves. His outfit was not so good, but his gaze showed indifference to our thoughts, and that made him the more formidable of the two. “You think that’s it?” Donald said. “That hut.” “I think it might be.” I walked past the sadhus and peered in. The hut was empty except for a rustic shrine. A picture of a snake was nailed to the wall, and offerings were arranged on a table beneath it. I walked through the room and down a narrow earthen hallway to a pit in the floor with a ladder poking out. I looked over the side. It was about fifteen feet to the bottom. I felt disoriented by the lack of museum context—ticket takers, guards, ropes. Thinking maybe this is just what you do, I got onto the ladder. Halfway down, a rung bowed and snapped, dropping me neatly onto the rung below. I gasped, then lowered myself carefully the rest of the way, putting my feet on the edges of the rungs, close to the rails, until I got to the bottom of the shaft, where I saw the entrance to a cave. The light was dim. A vine grew from the floor all the way up the wall. Little round fruits grew on the vine. I recognized them from a holiday Vic and I had taken to Thailand before Trip was born. I picked one. “Sandra?” Donald said. I looked up and saw him peering down from the top. “Uh, be careful on the ladder. It’s rotten.” “Wait there while I get the others, okay?” He ducked back out of sight. I heard the scholars up above, their voices overlapping. It sounded like they were arguing about whether to take off their shoes. I looked at the fruit I’d pulled from the vine. I peeled some of the skin off and touched the flesh to my tongue. It had the texture of a plum but the flavor of a grapefruit. I took three quick bites. “Are you eating the plant life?” Donald was looking over the top of the pit again. “You’ve heard the myths, right? I took food in the dark realm.” “Burmese grapes.” “Really? Hmm. Anyway, the shrine keeper took charge up here. Everyone has to take off their shoes and prostrate.” He lowered his voice and stage-whispered, “If I were you, I’d ut-pay away-ay the uit-fray. This man is very serious.” A barefoot man in a headlamp and shorts put a hand on Donald’s shoulder and looked down at me with a smile. “Ma’am, yes. Take off the shoes.” “I need the shoes.” “Ma’am? Okay, okay.” He climbed down the ladder, pausing to inspect the snapped rung, then glanced up at Donald. “Come.” “Oh,” Donald said. “Okay.” He called to the others. “Guys, he’s taking us down now.” I watched him begin to climb down the ladder, then turned and followed the shrine keeper through a hallway and into a small cave the size of a barbershop. It was dry, the ground rocky but mostly flat. The shrine keeper said, “Here,” and slipped through a tall, narrow crack in the wall. I turned my shoulders to the side, glancing to make sure Donald saw me, then went in after him. The shrine keeper and I were in a passageway. The floor tilted sharply to the left, toward a dark, narrow opening that ran parallel to the tilted pathway, like a gutter. I pressed myself up against the right wall, stepping carefully. Ahead of me, the shrine keeper lowered himself into a hole in the floor and gestured for me to follow. “Don’t want to fall here,” I said. “Can’t fall here.” Donald slipped in behind us. He noticed the gutter and picked up a rock and dropped it down into the chasm, counting to three before it hit the ground. “Does this seem safe to you?” he said. “Not really.” I lowered myself into the hole, following the shrine keeper, who led us down a winding maze of narrow passages, lit by only his headlamp. He moved nimbly, without any trace of hesitation, hopping up and over boulders and sliding between cracks. He had obviously led people in and out of the cave many times. He lowered himself onto his hands and knees. “Follow, Aunt,” he said, and slipped inside a rift. I crawled after him, into a gallery where we could stand. He pointed at a long crack in the wall, just above the floor. “You go,” he said. “Go, Auntie.” I knelt and peered in. The passage was narrow, about two feet high, but the walls were twenty feet apart, so it was sort of like a bedroom with a very low ceiling. “Will I fit?” I said. “Only sinners cannot pass, Auntie.” A bat flew silently into the strange bedroom. I crawled in after it. The rock under my hands was scratchy and dry. The ceiling got lower, and I had to lie on my stomach and drag myself, but before I could get too claustrophobic, I reached the other side and stood. It was a different section of the cave. The walls were moist and the rock rippled all over like the surface of water. The shrine keeper followed me. When he slipped out of the crack, he seemed energized. “River surface room,” he said, gesturing around. He pointed to another crack near the floor on the opposite side of the gallery and said, “Crystal room. Very special. On the stomach and drag.” He held out his headlamp. “You go ahead, Madame. Like this. Take the light. Like the snake. Like Superman.” Donald had caught up to us. He was right behind me, and he could tell that I was afraid. “Let me go first,” he said. He took the lamp and slipped into the darkness, grunting, making his way slowly. “It’s intense,” he said. Then he gasped. After a few moments, he called from the other side. “Come on, you have to see this.” Cave, by Claire Sherman. Courtesy the artist and DC Moore Gallery, New York City I looked at the shrine keeper and he nodded. I got down on my knees and looked in. It was like the previous space, but the ceiling was low enough that I would have to squeeze in, my back and stomach touching rock the whole way through. I could see Donald’s light reflecting off the ceiling. I slipped in and started to make my way forward. It was not as difficult as I’d expected it to be. I dragged myself into the crack on my forearms. “You doing okay?” Donald said. I turned my head to the side and closed my eyes. “If I try to tilt my head, my mouth brushes the rock.” “You just gotta get through to the other side. Just keep dragging yourself until you get to me.” “If this rock moves an inch, I’m crushed like a bug. I’m dead.” I closed my eyes and started to inch forward. I had the thought that the crack seemed to be narrowing. “Got to keep pushing it,” I said. “What’s that?” I grunted and felt my shirt rip against the rock. “Are you okay?” I extended my arms in front of me and dragged myself forward twice, then paused to breathe. “It’s longer than I thought,” I said. “It’s getting lower.” “You’re a little off course.” I opened my eyes. “It’ll be fine,” Donald said. “Just come to me.” “Donald?” “Don’t be scared.” “I think I’m going back.” “What?” “I need to get out. If I want to move my head forward, I can’t. I have to keep it to the side. I need to get out.” I pushed myself backward. I released all the air from my lungs and pushed again. I breathed in and found myself wedged in more tightly. “This is not good. I can’t move. Donald?” “Yes?” “I think I’m stuck.” “What? It can’t be. Just take a second and get your bearings.” I noticed a place at the far end of the crack where it got wider. “Okay, no,” I said, “I got it. I can see where it opens up.” I pushed myself to where the ceiling was higher. Even though I was off course, I wanted to breathe for a second. A pebble was wedged under my breastbone, and I reached under myself to move it, and then dragged myself two times quickly. Donald moved his headlamp, and I realized that the ceiling was not any higher where I was heading, that it had been a trick of the light. “Oh my god,” I said. “I thought it was going to get wider, but now that I’m over here I’m realizing it was just an illusion. The way the shadows fell, it made it look like it was wider over here.” “Come to me.” “I can’t. I can’t move.” “That’s not possible.” “It just looked like a way bigger space. I’m going to shove myself back.” “I remember a scouting book I read as a kid. It said if your head could get through a space, then technically your entire body could.” I was frantic suddenly. I started straining, trying to find a way out. Grunting, I exhaled and turned my head to the left, resting my cheek against the rock. “Oh my god. I think I’m stuck,” I said. “It’s not a joke. I think maybe yeah, I’m stuck.” “What? No. I got through fine and I’m bigger than you.” “I’m going to be sick.” “Try again.” I tried to rock forward. I managed to wriggle half an inch, wedging myself tighter. “I may need some help.” I couldn’t twist onto my side. I felt someone behind me reach into the crack and tug at my feet. My head was wedged in, turned to the side. I worried that someone would jerk my legs without warning and dislocate my spine, or paralyze me. “No!” I kicked my legs. “Stay calm.” I recognized the voice of the man who had been talking about ordering Pappy Van Winkle from Robert Pattinson at a bar. He said, “You’re the news lady, right? The producer? Your name is what? Cheryl. I’m Bart Diamond. I’m going to ease you out.” He pulled, popping my neck. “Stop! Now!” “Sorry. Cheryl? I just need to give you a...” “Stop! Don’t fucking pull my ankles. Don’t touch me.” “Sorry.” He let go of my feet. “Sorry.” “Just you go, ma’am. Just you go through.” I took several deep breaths, feeling my rib cage corseted by rock. “Sandra?” Donald said. The breccia was settling in around me. The cave felt alive and angry, like it was holding me close, telling me it was over. “Sandra?” someone said behind me. “Sandra, it’s Benito Cruz. We may have seen each other last night at dinner.” He cleared his throat and took off my shoes. “Don’t touch my feet!” “Yeah, don’t touch her feet,” Bart said. “She doesn’t like that.” “My head is caught here,” I said slowly and carefully. “If you pull my feet hard enough, you will break my neck.” “Are you hurt?” “My head is wedged in here somehow.” “Can you turn it?” “No.” “I see your feet.” Benito put a hand on either of my heels and squeezed gently. “Maybe I could—” “Benito?” “Yes.” “If you touch my feet again, I’m going to go crazy.” Benito let go of my feet. “I apologize.” “Would you please put my shoes back on.” Benito said, “I’m going to touch them now, just to put your shoes back on.” He slid my shoes onto my feet and called back to the other scholars, “No one touch her feet!” “What?” They were piling up behind me now. Some understood that my situation was potentially grave, but others didn’t. “Sandra? My name is Jody. I don’t think we met ever. But we’re supposed to take off our shoes. I think you should keep them off. Also, if you don’t mind hurrying, we need to get in to see the cave and then head back. A lot of us are jet-lagged.” “Listen,” a man’s voice said. “If you can get your head through a space, then technically your whole body will fit. So, all you have to do here is stay calm.” “Everyone,” Larry said. “We can help Sandra by—” I started to lose my temper. “By leaving me alone!” “The problem might be because you have shoes on,” Jody said. “The shrine keeper said take them off.” “Jody, please.” “Well, Larry, I’m just—” “Madame, you come back. Just you come.” “She can’t!” “Everyone,” Donald said loudly through the passage. “Everyone, please settle down and listen. What Sandra needs right now is to relax. When you are relaxed, you are smaller, and you are able to think more clearly. What I propose is that you all go back, give us some space. The shrine keeper can lead you. I’ll stay here with Sandra.” “We need the headlamp, Donald.” “Madame,” the shrine keeper said. “You come to see cave? Yes, you go.” “She’s stuck,” Donald said. “We need help.” “Sir?” “Donald. My name is Donald.” Donald let his fear for me show for a moment, and then he got hold of himself. “Stuck,” Donald called. “My friend is stuck. Trapped.” The other scholars echoed what Donald had said until the shrine keeper understood, and then he got out a second light and led them out of the cave. When it was quiet, Donald crawled back in with his hand over his lamp so the light was dim. He scooted in so we were eye to eye, like kids hiding under a blanket, and said, “I see what happened. Actually, let me just reach.” “No.” “Shh. Let me just...” He took a hold of my right hand and slowly began to tug. “Let’s just...” “Stop!” I said. “Please, stop.” “Sandra, I knocked. What’s your deadwood?” The straw from Donald’s thermos started to tip over his cup. I thought, Grab it, get the cup, but my hand didn’t move in time, and the whiskey spilled. It pooled, then dribbled toward me. We had the shrine keeper’s headlamp pointed at the ceiling and a pack of playing cards. A migraine extended from my head down into my chest, and though I could breathe, an unlocatable pain came with every inhale, then settled in my right hip. Water moved deep down in the cave, a spring or an underground stream. I kept hearing a noise like a gurgle or a whisper. It sounded like words, and I could almost understand what it said. If I could make it out, it would let me get free, I thought. And then I thought, You’re letting your fear get the better of you. Pull yourself together. Donald picked up the cup, wiped the liquid away as best he could with his hand, and poured more whiskey. He pushed the straw awkwardly toward my mouth. I parted my lips. “Here, I’ll count for you.” He turned the cards over, keeping score with a pencil and a tiny notepad. “The shrine keeper said they were sending men from the village with spades. That’s only about ten miles, but it’s dark outside, so they’ll be going slowly. I think the group should be getting back to the hotel by now, and they’re going to call in everybody they can. Jody has family in the embassy in Delhi, so I think by morning we’ll have this whole thing figured out. Until then, our only job is to keep our cool.” I let my eyes close, wondering if the embassy in India would be able to help an American in Nepal. I tried to lift my head, then tilted it back to rest it against the rock. “I’m sad,” I said. I was sort of joking, not expecting it to make sense to Donald. He exhaled from his nose, sort of laughing. “And I need to pee.” “Just go. It’s all right. I went too. Just on the other side of the cave.” I felt embarrassed. I wouldn’t have thought I could still feel embarrassed in this kind of situation. I would have thought that was an emotion for different circumstances. I peed. Then I must have fallen asleep for a while. I woke up when something skittered up my back. Donald had formed his shirt into a pillow and rested it under his own head. It irritated me. Why couldn’t he make two pillows, one for each of us? His snoring grew louder. I was suddenly terrified. I wondered, Why is this happening to me? And Trip! The insect stopped, turned, and began crawling down my side. I heard something on the other side of Donald’s feet. It sounded like an animal landing on the cave floor. A bright light flashed behind him. “He, murkharu! Uniharu yahaan chhan. Maile timiharulai bhaneko thiyeu!”1 It was the voice of a boy speaking Nepali. I heard a group of men who sounded like they were far away. I didn’t know it at the time, but they were the rescuers from a nearby village. One young man had rappelled two hundred feet, down a hole in the ceiling of the gallery on the other side of the crystal cave. The others had followed the shrine keeper’s route. Donald startled awake, knocking his head on the rock above. “Hello?” the boy said. “Ma’am?” “We’re here,” Donald said. “One minute.” He backed out and explained to the boy that I was stuck. The boy shone a flashlight into my face. He held the flashlight in place for a moment, then lowered it. “But her hand is there, sir,” he said. On the other end of my body, the rescuers gathered at my feet. One clutched my ankle and tugged. “Unko khutta nachhunu!”2 “Samatna arko thau nai chaina. Yo aapatkaaleen awastha ho. Ma unko jyan bachaaune kosis gariraheko chhu.”3 “Kati asabhya!”4 “Excuse me,” I said. “Please don’t touch my feet.” The man took his hand away. He said, “Okay, okay, ma’am. Sorry, sorry. It’s okay.” “Don’t pull her feet,” Donald called. “She’s wedged in there.” “Okay, sir. Okay, okay.” “Ahile uniharule ke bhaniraheka chhan?”5 “Sambhavata, ‘Unko khutta chhuna banda gara, murkha’ bhaniraheka chhan.”6 The man who had been touching my foot said, “Uniharu prashna sodhiraheka chhan. Ma bhandai chhu sabai thik chha. Tyesbhek, videshile khutta chhoyera narisauncha. Tyesko chinta nagar.”7 “Usle 1994 ma Dutch mahilasanga coffee khaeko thiyo, aba u bigya bhaeko chha.”8 “Sathiharu, shaant ho. Chup laga!”9the boy shouted at the rescuers. He shone his flashlight at me again. “This is dangerous, sir. Why did you come here without a guide? I could have been your guide.” “The shrine keeper was our guide.” “Mangel? Mangel guided you. Sir, Mangel is not suitable. This is a holy place, sir.” On the other end of my body, the man who had touched my feet said, “La, gayera heraun. Ma unlai taandai chhu.”10He took hold of one of my ankles and twisted it back and forth, then tugged angrily. “Rok. Rok. Saachchai, unlai yasari nagar. Videshile maane pani, timile ta ramrosanga jannu parchha.”11 Someone lit incense. Another man reached up and clutched at my crotch. Several of the men shouted at him, and he pulled his hand away. The boy looked down. “Her hand is there, sir,” he said again. “Did you not try pulling her?” “She said she was trapped.” The boy called out, “Yo brain surgeon le unlai taanna khojeko pani chaina. Uniharu tala basera whiskey piudai ra patte kheldai chhan.”12 The men laughed. The boy wiggled into the tube and grabbed my hands. “Oh,” I said. “I’m wedged in here pretty good.” He yanked my hands before I could say any more, pulling until some breccia snapped and I was unceremoniously drawn halfway out and he fell onto his butt. “Oh my god,” I said. The boy laughed and turned to Donald. “Easy-peasy lemon squeezy, sir. Just had to pull.” I put my hands onto the floor of the cave, and Donald and the boy helped me out. Only then did I notice the small cavern we were in. It was like we were sitting inside a geode. The walls, the floor, the ceiling—the entire cave was made of sparkling crystals. “Yes, take a moment, ma’am,” the boy said. “Very beautiful. Holy place.” “You want to stay for a minute?” Donald said. “Fuck no.” The boy looked offended. Donald laughed nervously. “What do we do now?” I said. “The men will go out and haul us up with ropes,” the boy said. He pointed to the corner of the cave. “Sir, you urinated here?” When we got back to the hotel, I was too exhausted to open my suitcase. I took off my clothes and got into bed and fell asleep. A few hours later, I woke up to pee. I walked across the room in the darkness. I had taken a few steps on the bathroom’s marble floor when my feet gave out under me, and I was falling through the air. I saw the sharp corner of the marble counter in the pale moonlight just as I heard my skull crack. My vision went white. It was more of a surprise than anything else, until the pain started. I was on the floor. I couldn’t lift my head. I opened my eye and saw that I had slipped on my hairbrush. “Lift me up!” I said. “Lift me up!” I felt overwhelmed with heaviness. There was a crushing weight on me, on my chest. The walls began to waver, like a calm sea, then they picked up into choppy waves, and I wondered if I could swim out, reach help. Then it appeared as though everything—the bathroom, the tub, the little window—was swept away. I shut my eyes. A mirage twisted to life in the black field of my vision. I began to tremble and twitch. I lost control of my bladder and bowels. I felt embarrassed again. Blood, drool, and snot pooled under my face. I lifted my cheek, then gently eased it back down against the marble floor. I tried to remember how I had gotten to this point. There had been a conference, geodes, a headlamp. I closed my eyes and saw a smoke-filled sauna, an arm ladling water onto rocks, a gust of steam. I was cold. My mouth and nose were dry like twigs, my breath cold on my forehead and cheeks. I dry-heaved. The bathroom floor burned. My hands and face were freezing. It was difficult to distinguish my face from the floor. I closed my eyes and saw smoke, like a wildfire. Sparks, or fireflies. A maelstrom blew away the bathroom, me, even the past. My breathing was labored—short and ragged inhales, long faint exhales. I regretted all the mental energy I had spent justifying selfish impulses. My mother sat near me, on the other side of the shower curtain, doodling on a yellow legal pad. I leaned my childhood banana-seated bicycle against the brick exterior of the convenience store and pushed open the glass door, turning shyly away from the man behind the counter as I went down the aisle to the Marathon candy bars. I picked up the long red package with its yellow stripe and tore it open. Milk-chocolate-dipped caramel lattice. The toilet was braided like the candy, woven to itself, chocolate-dipped, saying something to me about water. I wanted to close my eyes or open them. I didn’t really care. Candlelight flickered in my mind’s eye. It was fine.

        "story": "In the eighth grade I hit a kid named Kevin Flowers so hard in the face that he had to travel out of state to get a corrective rhinoplasty. He made a horrible joke. He hadn’t even been talking to me. He didn’t know any better. He only did it where I could hear him. Kevin was sat behind me in the cafeteria talking to his friends. He was saying these terrible things. They were laughing. He didn’t really do anything wrong but it got in my brain like a hot needle. Punched through the leather. I could feel all the red pressure of that make some big evil fist in the back of my eyes, how you’d feel the rot heat of a sinus infection. My shoulders had cramped up so tight that my body was shaking. I figured I had to wreck something to get it out of myself. I figured he didn’t know any better but I didn’t care at all. I got up and wrapped my hand all in the thin, greasy hair on the top of his scalp, wrenched his head back and hit him in the face so hard I split my pointer knuckle open on his canine. People were shrieking. I pulled him backward off the red plastic bench he was sat on and threw him down. He had a carton of apple juice there in his hand. His fingers clamped hard down around it from the shock of being hit and it sprayed out sweet and yellow all over his cotton shirt. He didn’t ever try to hit me back. I knelt on his chest and I hit him twice in the center of his face, arm drawn back how you’d go up to bat in a baseball game, force of the impact just shattering up through my shoulder, pure recoil. I fractured his eye socket. His nose was totally destroyed. I gave him a serious concussion. I split his upper lip, punched back so hard on his front teeth it cut apart right to the gumline. He looked like he had a cleft lip. He looked majorly deformed. It took this big, heavy learning-disabled kid who’d gotten held back a couple of times to pull me off his body and pin me down until I quit trying to get up and hit him again. I wasn’t sure about a lot of what happened once I had come back to myself, but I knew that I’d been screaming in his face, all my hair hanging down on him, quick flecks of drool and limp threads of clear spit how hot oil comes off hot meat while it’s frying. I was screaming down onto him. Is it funny to you. Do you think it’s funny. Do you think it’s funny. He was bleeding so badly. People were bringing him fistfuls of cheap paper napkins to wad up right under his nose. He was totally hysterical. He had pissed his pants while I was beating on him. He was skittering backward on the linoleum with his wet sneakers tacky and dragging on his own blood, wet blue jeans soaked dark and stuck to his weak legs, crying really hard. He was trembling, desperate. He couldn’t get his body to quit. He looked how a dog in a thunderstorm would. He put his wrists up like Christ, held right out in front of him, blood red as ordinary paint, dripped thick and drying in the crazed lines of his hands, and then he passed out with his back up on the concrete support pillar set in the center of the room. They’d painted the whole cafeteria this pastel color of pink. It looked like a kid hospital. I felt really unwell. Kevin had a girlfriend. Laurie Lee. She had a thick, greasy face the color of a rising moon. She had horrible pimples. They looked like they had to be hurting her. I didn’t figure anybody ever thought about that. How what makes you ugly makes you hurt. She had her thick little hands clamped, crab-clawed on the fine branching bones of his shoulder, agitating his slack body and dragging him into her lap, sat cross-legged and stained on the wet floor, and she was saying, You killed him, Hal. You killed him. I didn’t know what to do with the blood on my knuckles. I’d cut up my hand on his face. I wiped it up into my hair. I was feeling really fraught and demented. I didn’t feel like so much of a person. By the time that I was hauled up and out of the room and I saw him there, wet with the piss, blood and apple juice, I understood that I’d done a really terrible thing. I couldn’t quit looking at him. I wanted to tell him that I was sorry but I couldn’t do it. There wasn’t a right thing to do anymore. It had happened already. There wasn’t any way of walking it back. I could’ve gone to juvenile detention if Kevin’s parents hadn’t been so strange about it all. It was a really sad situation. Nobody liked Kevin. He was little and mean. He had gotten in fights before and he’d gotten his ass beat before and it’d been his fault. He’d gotten detention before and he’d gotten suspended before. What happened to him really wasn’t his fault and it wasn’t deserved. He hadn’t earned it. He hadn’t been asking for it. He hadn’t done anything wrong. Nobody thought about that. I hadn’t ever hit somebody. I hadn’t ever got very upset, taken something so hard that I had to destroy and to detonate that way before. I didn’t get in any serious trouble. Nobody tried to hold me criminally responsible. Kevin’s parents pulled him out of school for six months and then they sent him to the Catholic high school a county over for the following year. My parents offered to pay Kevin’s medical bills. My parents were called in to meet with the faculty. They asked me what Kevin had said to get me so mad. I told them I couldn’t remember. I figured they’d push me around on that, but they didn’t, and for a really long time it was true. I had a blank shape where Kevin ought to have rightfully been. Nobody got to shouting. I didn’t look anybody in the eye. They let me go to the bathroom. I put my hands underneath the hot water and spoke to myself, quiet, watching myself in the mirror until my face started to come apart, You killed him, Hal. You killed him. It really bothered me whenever I would think about it hard. I tried to play it again. I tried to play it back like it was only a videotape but there wasn’t a sound or a picture there for it. I had it in colors. I didn’t know what he’d said. I figured it must’ve been bad and I put it away. I quit thinking about it. On the long drive home my mom and dad had a stiffness to their bodies in the front seat that I mostly hadn’t seen before. Packed glitter ice on the road. It was snowing. Nobody spoke. I must’ve felt like a yellow wasp shut in the car with them. I must’ve felt like a devil dog. I wasn’t troubled by that. I wanted for them to look at me. Know me the way that I was. Cold in the blood now, and changed. Going to bed that night I was so cut up and sick about all of it that I couldn’t get to sleep. Long hours turning my body around, sweating, wispy baby hairs soaked to my forehead, damp of my shirt stuck flat onto my slick back. I got up out of the bed and I crept through the drowsing house, shedding my wet shirt, my bed pillow under my arm, and I locked myself into the bathroom. I slept in the bathtub with all the lights on, my left hand a navy-blue thundercloud, weeping clean plasma and cradled to my chest the way that you’d hold a stuffed animal. I got a week of suspension and for a long time I forgot about Kevin. Mandated counseling sessions two times a week. His name was Benjamin. He wasn’t a real therapist. He had a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the state college. He said if I ever felt like doing something like that to anybody again then I ought to try to take some deep breaths. Benjamin gave me a smooth pink stone out of a drawer in his battered desk. He said to hold it real tight in my fist anytime I was feeling afraid or upset. He really liked crystals. He really liked rocks. I carried that stone around in my chest pocket with my quarters and my peppermints, sometimes a crushed half pack of Newport menthol cigarettes. I slept with it tight in my hand. I guess Cody John saw me hit Kevin in the cafeteria. His father was the wrestling coach over at the high school. Cody John didn’t hardly know me at all, though I guess we had gone to the same birthday parties in kindergarten. He had no reason to think I was anything other than bad. He had no reason to want me around but I guess that he talked to his father about it. His dad came around to my parents’ house one afternoon not long after I hit Kevin Flowers. He asked my mom if I might maybe want to try wrestling. He said he thought it’d help me to get some aggression out. I didn’t want to get any aggression out, but I knew Cody John wrestled, and I figured Cody John’s dad came off as a decent type of man. He didn’t freak me out. He didn’t kick me around. I started going by the high school. Cody John was always glad to see me, which I couldn’t ever really understand. We’d sit on the wood bleachers watching the varsity team hit each other and struggle. Cody John’s dad always drove me home after, even though it wasn’t on his way to anywhere, and me and Cody John would sit in the back of the car, me on the left side and him on the right, how we did in Dylan’s car, even though he could’ve sat up front with his dad if he’d wanted to, and pretty often Cody John’s dad would buy me a soda at the gas station, or fries and a milkshake at the drive-through, the same way that he would for Cody John. I tried to give him twenty dollars one time, because he took me and Cody John to the Dairy Queen. I got a Dilly Bar and Cody John got a Blizzard with hot fudge and Butterfingers. He had to hold it with both of his hands. Cody John’s dad got a chocolate malt, and when I tried to press the crumpled cotton bill into his tough, chapped hand he said, Come on, Hal, and he laughed, and he wouldn’t take it from me. That made my chest hurt. I was so hurt that he’d laughed. I was so torn up about it. It really bothered me. Next time I saw him I told him to fuck off when he tried to put his hands on me at practice. He’d put his hands on the other boys to get them into position. I got up off of the mat and I walked out. I stood all alone in the locker room. I wasn’t sure what to do with my body. I couldn’t quit twitching. I couldn’t quiet myself down. I put my shirt and my blue jeans on over my singlet and wet my hair under the faucet. I put my wrestling boots in the trash. I sat out on the dark parking lot, shivering, until the practice was over. I wasn’t feeling so much of anything. I’d left my sweatshirt, my jacket and sneakers inside of the gym. Cody John found me there, out on the lot, in my socks, with my knuckles blue-pink and my mouth blue. He got the keys to the truck from his dad and he got it started, hit the heat high, wrapped me all up in a fleece hunting blanket he found in the back seat and sat me up front by the vents. He thawed me out. What had been numb got to hurting. I kept trying to tell him that I was sorry. My jaw was locked stiff. He was talking to me all the time. He didn’t seem fucked up about the way that I was. Cody John told me to wait in the truck. I hadn’t ever been so tired before. He got my wrestling boots from the garbage can. I’d figured Cody John’s dad would be ugly to me about it, but he wasn’t that. We didn’t talk about what happened. I fell asleep in the passenger seat while he drove me home. When Cody John’s dad pulled up on the drive, when he said, Wake up, Hal, buddy, we’re here, I felt just like a little kid. I wanted somebody to carry me. I wanted somebody to put me to bed. I said good night to them both and I went in the house. Cody John’s dad didn’t ever get mad when I got mad. He didn’t put his hands on me again. He was a good man. He gave me a whole lot of grace. By the time I started at the high school I had a lot of pretty good acquaintances. I knew all the wrestlers already, and they were decent to me, and nobody bothered me, and nobody tried to push me around. I didn’t think about Kevin at all. Not for a long time. Not until I heard about what had happened with Laurie Lee. She got too drunk at a house party, winter break sophomore year, and she tried to walk home by herself. They found her a street south of her own house in the dull suburb she lived in. All the houses looked the same. When her keys wouldn’t work in the door she lay down in a snowbank. She wasn’t wearing her jacket. She’d left it back at the party. They found her, blue and undamaged, there, grit and salt knotted in her stiff hair. They had to chisel her off the packed ice. She was fifteen. I knew that I’d really scared her, with Kevin. I had made one of her days bad. I couldn’t forgive myself for it. I got to thinking about what had happened a lot. We had a mandatory meeting in the high school gym the first day back at school. The microphone kept feeding back in a negative loop. Everybody bored on the bleachers. Some of the girls cried. Afterward I got a cheeseburger with Cody John. We were headed back around to the high school in my mother’s car when I remembered what Kevin had said in the cafeteria. I put it all together really fast. I pulled the car over, stalled out on the gravel shoulder and I put the parking brake on. I said, Cody, could you drive, maybe, and he said, Sure, Hal, for sure. Pale concern plain in his voice. I got out of the car and I threw up on the road, wet from the snowmelt, streaked slick with bright, grimy rainbows of oil. Ground beef and pickles. Cody John got me up. He fed me slow sips of his soda. He got in the driver’s side door and he got the car started. I lay my cheek on the door plastic, gripping my wrist tight until it was wax white and bloodless. Cody drove it with the windows down. Clean smell of pine and cold water. I didn’t talk about it. I was late to fifth-period chemistry. I didn’t want for anybody to see it. I had come to understand that if I didn’t feel anything on the outside then it couldn’t do me any damage in my body. I knew that it set me apart. I knew that it made me too different. I knew that if I said it out loud nobody would look me in the eye ever again. I knew that everybody thought I was strange. I figured that they didn’t want to know why. I hadn’t wanted to know why. Probably not ever. I hadn’t wanted a reason. I wanted power, and muscle, and teeth. All of the wrestling made me tall, somehow. Scaffolding of my weird, jointed, stiff body rebuilt, reconfigured in some way that made it strong, whole, long and tough, broad and built out of gristle, and wire, and iron. Fat wrapped around it to make me look just like a regular man, but I wasn’t that. I had gone wrong somewhere. There was no fixing that. There was no turning away from it. I wore it under my shirt. Caught in the wrong type of light you could see it glitch. Dark halo. Frail splinter hologram. I didn’t like to look anybody in the face for too long, how I hated to see it there. I was afraid that I’d see it there. Somewhere I was always afraid.

        "story": "Just I suspected everybody in here nursin drinks. Don’t go on gulpin shit down now. I already exposed y’all for the pussies y’all are. I already knew I was the only nigga in Maycomb who could take whiskey to the head, no nose pinchin. Where the fuck Cooter at? Cooter, where you at? Come out, come out, wherever you are! I’m a fine madame with her twat open. There the motherfucker is. Cooter, you hide right under my nose again and I’m liable to smack you with my good arm. You better turn that stool round when I’m talkin to you. I gotta start swingin my johnson? You don’t know who your daddy is? You know I’m just gettin on you like I do. Some of y’all in here dumb enough to get all the way riled up. Cooter, how you doin? Seriously—how you doin? You gonna move a stool over or you drinkin alone tonight? Cooter the only nigga sides me come close to what I do. The rest of y’all niggas here is what we call forty-minutes-a-glass—thirty I’ll give you. Cooter, twenty-eight. He ain’t beatin me no time, but at least he could hang his scarf on that. Louncy, do me a favor and wipe this part of the counter—I finna park here next to Cooter—I don’t want no beady beads under my shit when I’m drinkin it. You know what I’m talkin about—them wet beady beads that be under the glass—don’t nobody want none of that from somebody else glass. I swear y’all play the same shit in here over and over and over, make me dizzy. Alien come to Maycomb think “King Porter Stomp” the only record anybody ever made. Pour it all in, thank you very much. Don’t mind me checkin for squeaks. Last time I had to scrape a dry booger cuz nobody in the back knew how to scrub a glass down. Cooter, man, how you been? Your boy start walkin frontward yet? Man, that’s what they do all day—you come to tickle they feet, the whole broadside is dirt. How the yield this year? That sure is a whole heap. Say, how much of that you get to keep for yourself? That killed me when I was tillin. Bushels and bushels and bushels. Here, your bushels of peanuts, Mr.Horace. Oh, he let me have some all right, but it was always the ones with the twigs stickin out. Odd jobs is where it at. I do it all and never too proud. Catch raccoons and all for cold hard green. I stroll down American Legion Drive daylight time where all the junkyard houses is—where the can’t-readin white folks is. Pretend I’m mindin my business chewin my mint stick. Fore long, one of the dirty crackers will spot you. Hey boy, come stack these here tires together. Hey boy, my missus need help scrubbin this outhouse. Hey boy, these ducks here need to be feathered. Hey boy, hey boy, hey boy, hey nigger, hey nigger. That’s how they do it—so they can say that. Make sure they give you money to say, Nigger, don’t get it confused, we better than you. But I snatch all their dollars and I think, You might be better than me, but I seen those things crawl out ya child’s hair. Cooter, where’s that lady was feelin on the side of your head last time? That lady that wuhn’t your wife? Oh, I get it. You wished I was blind, huh? I was blind till she sat on your lap and you got up and tried to cover up the bulge. Cooter, I ain’t judgin. You know me. All I ask for is the details. The color of the undergarments, what the nipples was like, what she was screamin. That’s all I ask for, then I shut my mouth and throw away the key. This me, this the key right here faraway. Come on, Cooter, you poked her, didn’t you? You sly fox, open your mouth, let me see them jagged teeth. You let her see it, didn’t you? Cooter, come on, I’m dyin here. You know this is what I come down here for. I can’t sit here bein deprived. You gonna stand up here, kiss, and keep to. You know what, Cooter, fuck you. To think I fucked up my arm and was like I don’t wanna live no more. Replayin it in my head. Should have never listened when Mr.Raymond said reach in and pull out that thread and I said, It’s off, right?, and he said, It ain’t gonna move no how cuz it’s stuck. Doctor wanted to lop the whole thing off and I said no—even had sense then to know whitey want you pickin shit up with both hands. I was real sad. Then of course everybody wanna pick the day after to tell me I should never go stickin my hand in no gin even when the engine turned off. Whole ordeal had me in the back of the cabin sobbin on myself cuz I thought now I was never gonna get any kitty cat. Come to find out women love a retarded arm more than they like scars. And don’t let me get started on shinin the nightstick. Stop it. Everybody in here shine the nightstick so shut the fuck up about that one right now. When my arm lost the feelin, it was like another person was strokin it. No, not like that. Like a different person, but a woman. You know what—nobody tell y’all shit cuz y’all keep tryna mince people’s words. I don’t like tail? I could tell you about some shit just happened the other day. Mmm-hmm? Funny how I was just talkin to Cooter, but somehow everybody got their earlobe out. Same people who said I was strange two seconds ago. Oh, look, billiards done freed up, why don’t y’all go over there? Mmm-hmm—tell me a lie now. I’ll let y’all hang out. Even though Louncy warned people about hoverin. I told y’all about my odd-job hustles. All up Georgia Prince and American Legion Drive. All them families. The Mayfields, the Caugherties, Kit Yarbrough and her old-teeth-chitterin husband, the Cunninghams, the Pullams, and the Ewells all the way off the path. They all can do they own damn chore work, like I said, but me doin it make them feel better about their own station. Never mind their babies is runnin with just draws on and car oil all over they face. Some of these folk front doors is straight up knocked off the hinges. But I don’t mind, long as we scratchin each other’s backs. Most of them ain’t bad—they’ll say, Hey boy, I’d appreciate it if you turn that there stump into wood chips for me, or, Hey boy, lend me a hand settin these beaver traps here, here, and here, and they leave me to my work and the chirpin birds and come out with my quarter when it’s time. I’d say damn near all of them is like that except Mr.Bob and the gotdamn Ewells. They the dirtiest of them all. With Mr.Bob, it’s always Hey, nigger this, hey, nigger that. I don’t mind Hey, nigger, but the way Mr.Bob say it, he say it like he tryna erase you. And the shit he make you do is most ungodly. One time he say by ordinance I must shove my good arm down the drain cuz one of his boys fixed it in his mind to hide a key. Didn’t bother to clear none of the porcelain—I felt green slime that I know ain’t been scrubbed out in years. Another time, he had me climb up to the roof and come down with two dead squirrels and then chastise me, talkin bout if I came Thursday like he said, they wouldn’t of rotted and Mayella could of made them up nice with corn. Then pretty soon he start gettin the whole family involved, two sons. I’d come on by and the near-grown one would be out linin bottles up neat on a slab of wood and swattin them all down so he could have somethin to do and the small one is out doin nothin but cuttin up duck dung with a stick, and old Ewell would see me comin and put his two gnarled fingers in his mouth and whistle and go, Boys, come over real quick, let me teach you how to be men, and I’d be there thinkin, Why these boys here when it’s high noon and ain’t nothin wrong with the schoolhouse? Boys, this is how you get stuff done. You gotta have sense. Ain’t logical to go breakin your back and there’s niggers all around you waitin to be told somethin. You gotta remember God made your brains different. He made your brains for givin orders—sayin all this with me in front a them listenin. He go to smallest one, go, Ford, son, repeat after me: Nigger. And the boy cast his eye down all shy: Nigger. Go over yonder. Go over yonder. And drill a hole. And— Come on now. And drill a hole. In that stone. In that stone. And as soon as he finished, I’d say Yessir and act like I was trippin over myself to do it even though I knew I was lucky if I got a weak drill and a dirty nickel. Then the boys got comfortable after a while. One time they said, Nigger, come here, see those two cups, one of them is piss and the other is apple juice, but we can’t seem to tell which one is which. Can you help us out? They threatened to call they daddy and his friends who got rope for days, so I taste the first one and it’d be beyond sour and so would the second. I’d stand there confused as hell while they keeled over laughin talkin bout, I guess they both was urine. I swear I never felt so murderous in my life, and the nineteen-year-old sister Mayella, she’d tell me pull weeds out front or shoo a dog off the property and her thing is— Shit I’m gettin off track. So just this past Tuesday, I’m mindin my business on my way to do somethin for Kit Yarbrough and I hear whistlin from the Ewell porch and I turn around and it’s Mayella talkin bout, One second, nigger, and I say, Yes, and she say, I need you to bust up a chifforobe for me. Now I done done chores for Mayella before—like I said, pullin weeds, and she like to be there the whole time till it’s done, and there’d be times I’d turn around to get another trash bag and she’d turn her eyes right back on the porch on whatever she was sweepin up. She got a way of gazin at you like there’s no such thing as self-control. One time it cracked 102degrees and I kept my shirt on the whole goddamn afternoon cuz if I took it off that bitch would of been liable to catch a heart attack! Anyhow, so I say, All right, ma’am, or whatever, and go round the back for the chifforobe, maybe old Ewell put it back there for me out by that old wringer, and ain’t none of the Ewells around, and I yell, Mayella, and she go, What, and I go, I don’t see no chifforobe out here, and she go, It’s not out there, and I go, Where it at then, and she go, It’s upstairs, and I get suspicious right there and then cuz who ever heard of bustin up furniture in the house? You heard of bustin up furniture in a house? Tell me how you figga? You did it? Cooter, your lazy ass ain’t do shit! Your lazy ass wouldn’t get up off the couch if you smelled fire. I bust up furniture for the church and I bust up furniture for my ex-gal who keep inventin shit for me to do. Everybody know you bust it up outside so you got space and cuz it’s goin in the outside garbage. No, no, no, no, no, no. Bustin it up inside don’t make it easier to carry out the pieces—well, it make it easier, but you want all that bangin inside and it’s hot?—you carry it outside so the noise and all that jazz don’t get to you. Jesus, Cooter, will you just listen to me? Bottom line, bottom line is, this girl invited me in the house, inside. And you know me, I always like seein where shit will go. But I swear of all the dastardly, decrepitated shit in there, it’s the sturdiest, newest thing they got—I’m tellin you, house doors chewed up from the bottom, a piano in there with no cover and half the keys missin, window screens garbled and oatmeal hardened on tin cups. I look at that chifforobe lookin all new and I go, Miss Mayella, you sure? And she go, Just bust it up. I take the hammer, but I do it slow and I’m about to follow my orders, but somethin don’t feel right about bustin up a perfectly good piece of hardwood, so I turn around and say, You know what Mayella, I’ll be glad to take this chifforobe off—and like clockwork the bitch jumps on my back, the bone of her pussy on my spine. I know. I know! Same thing I thought! But are y’all gonna let me finish, though? Let me finish! Jesus, y’all a bunch of hounds! Me too! Me too! I thought the most she was gonna do was brush up on me or say, Here, sit on the bed, and I’d say, That won’t be necessary. Now here she come rubbin my outline, makin like this, makin like that. Gettin me up. The bitch face look like rusted tools, but pussy is pussy—don’t pounce on me for that. What? If you was blindfolded and your dick was in Josephine or the ugliest bitch, you wouldn’t wanna get out neither, am I right? Touch me, she go. Remember, I don’t know this bitch from a tear in the couch. All I know she the gal on Bob’s porch who be sweepin angry sometimes. I hear her from the stove in the window from time to time clangin pots. But that’s it. Only said good morning to her once, that time she was sittin in some abandoned car singin off-key. Now here she is talkin this craziness. With that hand, she go. And she take my crippled hand and shove the fingers of it in her and I ain’t felt shit in that hand since the accident, but I let her do it a little bit. For the next time Bob wanna teach his sons about lazy nigger hands while I’m right there breakin my back for him, I’ll be thinkin, Lazy hands that your daughter wanted all up in her nethers. What you’re gonna do is take it out, she says. Done got the rope slung halfway around my neck! Mayella, I says—smilin cuz I don’t know what else to do—what is wrong with you? What? That’s not what I came here to do, I says. By now, I’m all types of puzzled. Tom Robinson, she goes, pullin at my middle. Are you a man or not? Now, fellas, you know me. I like my share, and I’ve had my share, but I know where I am. And I’m not about to get into some mess that not even Maycomb’s best can get me out. So I say to myself, Time out, let me take the same advice I give my sons on the subject of bringin girls down to the shed. And that is, it might feel good in the moment, but it will always have teeth. I gather myself, and I finna go. You know what the problem was? Problem was I looked back and there she was in the corner. I couldn’t just look past her. And then she let it all spill out. I hate my daddy. He don’t never let me do nothin. Won’t let me dance or touch the radio. I make him a dish and he got to complain about what’s in it. I can’t do this, I can’t do that. Always comparin her to just like a nigger. How she shiftless like us, how a nigger could figure it out faster. He mad cuz of my mama and he’s got to put it on everybody, she goes. I ask him, Why ya so obsessed with niggers? That’s why Ma left you? And that’s how I got these. Big purple welts up and down her thigh. Remember, this is a girl who idea of adventure is countin pickup trucks. Not to mention what end up happenin to her mother. The girl never seen nothin out in the world. She the type who you have to say we call that dot at the end of the sentence a period. Sittin there trapped in a tower like the damsel that failed. I let her touch it. I know, I know. I don’t know what I was thinkin. I let her handle it and I might have let her peck it a couple of times. Fellas, please, please! Don’t celebrate that. She was already touchin and feelin me before and I guess that had me stoked up. But if you wonderin was there any type of eruption, I’ll stop you right there. Look at Cooter, confused. Like why he tellin us this. Because one moment we alone and the next there Bob is at the top of the stairs! It was like he already knew. He just barged in, grabbed her by the wrist, started smackin her in the face, and let me go out the door. I swear to my whole God. Cooter, you and I been cuttin the fat for what, seven years now? Ever since the sorry day I met you on Dock8. And the rest of you. Y’all cuckoo, but okay. We done had many a swell night together drinkin this here poison. Let this stool be my witness. Somethin strange happened. Yesterday, I was down that same neighborhood and nobody needed a hand with nothin. Not one person. I found it funny cuz it seem everybody there itchin for me to fix toilets they won’t let me use. I go to Kit Yarbrough’s, but there she is hidin behind her screen door. I says, Miss Kit, could you use a hand today, and all she does is growl. I repeat it kinder this time, but same thing, so I just take the hint and back off. Later that night, I sat at home and thought about it. Did Bob say somethin? Mayella? The either or the both of them? What they say? Fuck it, I don’t regret nothin. Well, maybe that I shouldn’t of let her peck it. But what on earth could they have said? Oh heck, it’s nothin. The Ewells not the cleanest folks, but they wouldn’t make nothin up. They not that low. I been doin work for them a good two years now. They wouldn’t make nothin up. They not that low. It’s prolly nothin.

        "story": "We’d been in Maine six months, but for the first three our kids had continued to Zoom with their Brooklyn school and then summer had come. And then it was the third week of September, and I was still trying to convince myself that one good thing about being in this place I’d never meant to be was that I might finally become someone other than I was. I’d put an alert on my phone two weeks before and signed on five minutes early to our kids’ new school’s PTA meeting. Sophie’s camera was off at first. I didn’t recognize her name until her face appeared, her background blurred. I’d mostly referred to Sophie as Beautiful Partygoer, during those years at NYU. Our first month, she’d been chased down the street by a scout for Law & Order and had spent three weeks filming as an extra. It had somehow filtered to me through communal bathroom talk that Beautiful Partygoer was the name of the role they’d given her. The Maine school, just south of Portland, had 250 kids. There were sixteen mothers and one father on the call. The three women who seemed most in charge talked about fundraisers and the now-canceled ice-cream social, planning pre-packaged snacks to drop off for the teachers during teacher appreciation week. COVID cases had risen again and the open house the week before had also been moved to Zoom. “Lizzie!!!” Sophie messaged when I introduced myself. “OMG I CANNOT BELIEVE!!” I tried, and then deleted, an all-caps response. “Sophie!” I responded. “It’s been so long! How are you?!” There was another woman on the call, Julie, also from New York. She raised her hand, first her actual hand, then her Zoom hand, and then she unmuted herself and emitted two short chirps until the president acknowledged her. Julie and her husband, Justin, wanted to offer to buy an aquarium for the main entrance to the school. Their kids’ Manhattan private school had had an aquarium—“The shot of color first thing in the morning! The life!”—450gallons, fish included. Julie suggested maybe different classes could take turns with upkeep each week or month. I watched the principal, who was also present, bite down hard on her lower lip. “Julie is making us both look bad,” Sophie wrote to me in a private message. I laughed out loud, then realized I wasn’t muted, and everybody looked to where my square must have been on their screens. I saw the weird, distorted look of my face, half laughing, my face freezing then collapsing: I turned my camera off and put myself on mute. “I wasn’t sure it was you at first,” said Sophie, when we met the next week for coffee after drop-off. She was the managing attorney for an immigration-law nonprofit. When I knew her in college, I’d pretended not to like her, but it still felt important, both then and now, that she like me. I had made no friends yet in this town but had decided maybe it was better this way. I liked my kids and husband. I walked the dog a lot and was listening to the audiobook of Middlemarch for the third time. “It’s me,” I said, apologetic maybe. I held my hands up in the air and then felt dumb and put them down. We sat outside in linen pants and sandals, though it was almost October. I was still bracing myself for the arrival of Maine cold. Equally as bracing was this ominously unseasonable warmth. “You look the same,” she said. Sophie was still gorgeous, if a little fuller. I could tell by the way she pulled at her shirt before she sat down that she didn’t like being fuller, but I thought it made her even more beautiful than she’d been before. Youth was separate, less impressive—she’d had that gamine thing in college—but the weight she’d gained made her look more lustrous; it filled out her cheeks that might otherwise have looked wan. I watched the way she held her coffee and tried not to notice whether the men who walked by stopped to watch her. In college, in downtown Manhattan, a place with no dearth of gorgeous women, men had often stopped to look at her when she’d walked past. After that first coffee, Sophie got busy with work, then David went out of town for two weeks and I was consumed by kids and my new teaching job, standing at the grocery store with only half an hour until pickup, riffling through the hot plastic rotisserie-chicken bags, trying to find the one that looked least sad. During the October PTA meeting we messaged back and forth and I kept my camera off and myself muted and David came out to ask what I was doing because I had laughed so hard I’d woken up our younger son. Right before the treasurer asked if anyone had remembered to keep the minutes, Julie launched into a proposal. A small contingent of Afghan refugees had been moved into the Holiday Inn two blocks from the school and she wanted to pay for all their kids’ school lunches; the principal had to explain to her that school lunches were, as of this year, free for all the kids. “Are you doing restaurants?” Sophie messaged. I didn’t know if I was doing restaurants, because I had no friends in town. “Outdoors?” I messaged Sophie. “Until it snows, I guess?” It was another month before we actually got together. I kept wearing David’s clothes to pickup and then became convinced that none of the moms talked to me because I was so schlubby, but also Casaubon had just died, and I always had my AirPods in. Our younger son turned seven—I’d invited Sophie to the party, but her kids were older and had another, different birthday party. I realized, calling the pediatrician to make our new seven-year-old his checkup appointment, that this meant I also had to get my IUD replaced. One of the draws of my new job was that it was the first in my grown-up life to offer health insurance, and it felt thrilling, bougie and indulgent, to be able to call a doctor whenever I needed. The year that Jack turned five we’d not been insured, and I’d gone to a Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn. I hadn’t been to a doctor since he was born. I shook the whole time, crying, half because I was afraid she’d tell me I had cancer and was dying and half because I worried the removal and the re-insertion would cost too much. The kind PA who saw me that day had told me I didn’t need to get the thing replaced until seven years after it was put in. “It’s FDA bullshit,” she said, speaking very softly, her face close to mine. “Five minutes in and out,” the Maine OB nurse said when she saw I was shaking. Her name was Taylor. She looked only a few years older than my children, straight, dark hair and lots of makeup. She talked to me softly, confidently, leaning forward as she did. She pressed the tips of her fingers together in front of her face, hands held horizontal, then folded the backs of her hands flat together to show how easy it would be, how the IUD would “fold right up.” The OB came in and put the speculum in and reached up into me to pull the IUD out. The OB pulled and pulled and her face started to look strange and then worried. “It has little wings,” she told me, also watching me shake, having been warned, it seemed, by Taylor. “I just grab the bottom, the wings fold down, it slips right out.” She did the same thing with her hands that Taylor had. She pulled three more times. I could see her face begin to harden. Taylor stood very quiet next to me and my uterus contracted, a tight pinch and then a short stretch of cramping and I dug my fingers under the thin strip of paper into the linoleum of the chair. “It’s not coming,” said the OB. “I noticed that,” I said. “We might—” she said. “Wait here a minute.” My legs and feet were still spread by the stirrups, the cold metal of the speculum still in. She got the ultrasound machine, unscrewed and removed the speculum, the cold familiar metal slip of it. She got out the gel and wand and it was all the same as it had been when I was pregnant, her looking around with that long white stick inside me, me able to see only a mess of blacks and grays and whites up on the screen. “There it is,” she said, looking over at the muddle. “It’s embedded in your uterus. “We’ll need to get a camera up there to get it out,” she said, the white wand still inside me. She walked me through my options: either the OR, or the procedure room in her office. “I can numb your cervix here,” she said, “but I can’t knock you out.” “I don’t want to be knocked out. I like to know,” I said, feigning toughness. “I have a pretty high pain tolerance.” Sophie and I had talked about this briefly. I’d had both boys naturally, within two years of each other. Her girls were three years apart. She had said, deadpan: “I miss my epidural almost every day.” The OB had no availability for the next three weeks, and she said I couldn’t rely on the IUD for pregnancy prevention. “You might bleed and cramp a little,” she said, “off and on.” “For three weeks,” said David, obviously annoyed. I didn’t press on whether he was pissed about the fact that he would have to pull out in his forties or that I would be bleeding off and on and in near-constant low-level pain for the next few weeks. That night, Jack kept coming out of his and his brother’s room saying that he couldn’t fall asleep and needed me to help him. “You just close your eyes,” I said. “I can’t,” he said. David was asleep already. I was reading, cramping. “There’s nothing I can do to help,” I said. “Can you come lie with me?” This was his new Maine thing. He would come out long after they’d brushed their teeth and I’d read to them and his brother had fallen asleep. Jack would stand and stare at me. “I can’t sleep,” he’d say. “Just close your eyes,” I’d say, though I was also on the couch, reading or watching TV on my computer, because I had to trick myself to sleep. “They just open up again,” he said. I’d been having this recurring thought, every night when I lay in bed with him, that one night his brother’s top bunk would fall on top of him, and I would try to gauge how quickly he might be able to roll away were this to happen, considered setting up the beanbags next to his bed more methodically, going into their room in the middle of the night and carrying him into bed with us. “You’re sure it’s solid?” I would say as calmly as I could to David, who had put the beds together. Each time we’d moved he’d taken them apart and put them back together, and each night, as I put the boys to bed, I stared at the seams where the wood met, touched the slats that held Henry’s mattress above Jack’s, and tried to force myself not to imagine the crush of bone and soft internal organs as his brother’s mattress and all that wood came down onto him.   “I think I have to go to New York,” I said to David the next week. I thought maybe, vaguely, it was the hormones. Though the IUD had been stuck like that for the past seven years, I suddenly felt its presence constantly. The cramping had continued, as had the bleeding, and Sophie, my only real local prospect for friendship, had been subsumed by work, and I was crying spontaneously at different points throughout the day. “For work?” said David, about this trip that I’d proposed out of nowhere. I thought of lying, emailing a random editor and setting up a coffee meeting that I’d then pretend might turn into work, but I did not. “For mental health,” I said. There was art to see, and a friend of mine had had a baby during the pandemic whom I hadn’t held yet. My friend’s husband worked in tech, and he’d just sold a bunch of stock and they now owned a whole house with an empty basement apartment where they’d said that I could stay. I said, “Just four days.” I got a seventy-nine-dollar bus ticket that left early in the morning. The first two days were perfect. I saw art, held my friend’s baby. I walked for hours around the city, because I didn’t have to get up the next morning to make breakfast or pack lunches or make sure the boys had their folders and their extra masks and water bottles, snacks in their separate pockets so they wouldn’t accidentally eat them during lunch. My last full day I tried to FaceTime the kids six times, but I kept getting texts saying they were playing, Dad was cooking, they were at Henry’s soccer game. It rained and all the coffee shops were too crowded and the bathrooms I used to sneak into in Manhattan were all locked or now only for employees. I got soaked and bought three six-dollar coffees and a seven-dollar umbrella that broke on my way to the subway and I almost wet my pants letting myself into my friends’ basement, throwing my bag down, my hands frozen and my phone almost falling out of my pocket while I peed. Another friend invited me to outdoor drinks with a friend of hers whom I knew vaguely. I’d seen her at birthday parties, a few playdates, over the years. I felt too tired but also didn’t know when I’d next be back in New York, so I said yes and ate the half jar of Jif I found in the basement cabinet because the idea of spending money again on another meal made me feel insane. My friend’s friend was tall and striking, not beautiful, but so specific-looking: a big, long nose; large eyes; thick, long black hair. Her kids were younger, went to one of the hippie private schools deeper in Brooklyn that made all the parents sign up for volunteer shifts shelving books and cleaning classrooms, as if to somehow absolve them of the guilt of their school’s privateness. She wore oddly shaped, loose-fitting clothes that looked inexplicably expensive, though whenever I’d complimented a thing she’d worn, she’d always claimed she “thrifted it somewhere.” Her husband’s family had a country house upstate that, I knew from Instagram, was where they’d spent most of their pandemic. “They got a really awful case of COVID,” my friend told me before she got there. “The whole family. She was hospitalized for two weeks.” We started to talk about it and then my friend’s friend said she didn’t want to talk about it and set her drink down so hard that it sloshed in the glass and I sat back farther in my chair. “Our kids are fucked,” my friend’s friend said. “Just face it. All of us. Dan and I have been talking about going off the grid somewhere up by you, northwest of Portland, build something sustainable and solid where we can hunker down.” The night was perfect, still unseasonably warm, but we all wore jackets and all the outside tables had groups of two to five sitting at them, leaning close to one another, laughing, talking, the lights from the street, the passing cars. I hated living in Maine, I’d thought, each day walking around the city. I’d only ever felt good or safe or alive in New York. As this woman spoke, I wanted to crawl across the table to her, knock the drinks and the shared plate of french fries over, climb on top of her and pull her hair like Jack pulled Henry’s hair when he was angry, until she promised she would take it back. “I don’t...” I started. “If this year has taught us anything, I think we just don’t know,” I said. “We know it’s going to be more and more chaos,” she said. “It’s not like our kids will go to fucking college. It’s not like there will be any type of safety, any type of continuity to the lives they live.” The next morning was my last one in New York, and I went running in the park just like I’d gone running almost every morning all the years that we’d lived in Brooklyn. The night before, walking home, I’d had the sensation again of the bed falling on Jack. I’d called David when I got back to the apartment, but he hadn’t answered. At 2 am, I’d texted, “Can you just send me a picture of the boys when they wake up?” “Watch out,” I heard, entering the park that morning, sludgy and hungover. And then tires screeched, and then a force so hard and fast, thin rubber into my ass, up the small of my back, and then briefly flying, the hard shock of asphalt on my hands and knees and elbows, the way the pain felt sure and solid, coursing slowly up my back and shoulders, not unlike relief. “What the fuck?” said the cyclist whose bike had run into me at full speed. He wore purple Lycra. “Of course,” my friends said later. “Lycra! Fucking bikers.” “But it was my fault,” I would repeat each time. It was. He wasn’t hurt at all. “Fuck,” I said. “I’m sorry.” I stood up, shaky, not sure what hurt and what didn’t, what was and wasn’t bleeding. I was standing. My phone wasn’t damaged. My friend’s basement keys had dug into the palm of my hand, and it bled. My back and neck felt rattled, stiff and maybe misaligned or something. Both my elbows had been scraped and bled. “It was my fault,” I said again. “I’m sorry.” The guy looked confused, I thought, that I wasn’t angry. I watched as he became less angry. “Are you okay?” he said. “Your elbows?” I nodded, looking again at their bleeding, more bikes speeding around us. Runners ran by, stared. “I’m fine,” I said. He looked at me, examined his bike. “I’m so sorry again,” I said. I walked across the park. My body clenched in unexpected places. My elbows bled, sore and stinging. My friend looked shocked as I limped into her apartment instead of down into the basement. She walked past her sobbing two-year-old, new baby on her hip, and touched my bloodied skin. “Fucking bikers,” said her husband, from in front of his computer. “It was my fault,” I said, but quiet enough that only my friend heard me. She found an empty Tums canister and poured whiskey in it, sipped from the bottle quickly. “For the bus,” she said. I’d almost forgotten about the IUD except for the sporadic cramping. I had phantom pains all over. Was it my back, my neck, my brain? Sophie called that week and asked to get a drink, as her work schedule had finally lightened, and I almost said I couldn’t make it. It seemed so like her, so like my idea of her, that she could finally fit me in. “Before the holiday bullshit takes over,” she said. It was almost Thanksgiving. “Go,” said David. “You said you liked her.” “I do,” I said, thinking of the Sophie that I’d known in college and whom I’d hated for no other reason, really, than how beautiful she was. A few weeks after we had met again, David made me find a picture of her online. “That’s her?!” he said, incredulous. I looked at him hard to try to figure out what he was asking, what he was thinking. It wasn’t a great picture. “She’s not...” he started. I could see him trying to figure out what to say and wondered about all the things he wasn’t saying. He shook his head and kissed me on the mouth instead. We met outside, close to the water. It was finally colder: we wore coats and I wore a knit hat and drank whiskey. I told her about my trip to New York, but not about the bike. She told me about work, her husband getting annoyed about how busy she’d been, her daughter being courted by and then falling out with a group of sixth-grade girls. “I’m terrified of what comes next,” she said. “Female adolescence is no fucking joke.” “My IUD is stuck,” I said out of nowhere a couple of minutes later. We’d been talking about her daughter, hormones. “What do you mean stuck?” she said. “They misinserted it,” I said. She made a face and waited for me. “It’s embedded in my uterus,” I said. I thought of a bodega umbrella, cheap and black and broken, stuck inside me. “Jesus,” she said, signaling the waiter for another round for both of us. “It’s called a hysteroscopy,” I said. “One of those little cameras,” she said. Her second pregnancy had involved endless complications and her daughter had been born ten weeks premature. “The uterus heals itself, the OB said.” “I could drive you,” said Sophie. “She said I should be fine to drive.” “Oh, let me drive you,” Sophie said. “If I have to work from home another day, I might murder someone. I’d be so grateful for an excuse to put on pants.” David had said he had to work and I had been annoyed but also told him the OB had said I should be okay so long as I could wait a while after. “You’re so tough,” he said. With Jack I had walked home from the hospital twenty-four hours after labor; and both David and his mother loved to tell this story. My previous labor had been long and painful, scary, and the second had felt so easy by comparison. Of course, after that walk and a gaggle of friends packed into our apartment, me nursing on the couch and David finding serving platters for all the food that everyone had brought us, toddler Henry sipping from someone’s wine and then spitting it at her and saying that her juice was bad—after all that, I had spent two days on the couch mostly only nursing and feeling like death. “What if I promise to work the whole time I’m waiting,” said Sophie. “You can even drive us back home. Let’s say I need the change of scenery.” “I’ll buy both of us lattes after,” I said. “A date!” My back still hurt from the bike, but I’d started running again. My elbows were mostly healed, though Jack still asked to look at them sometimes when I lay with him in bed. David kept forgetting about my appointment and I had to remind him again that morning that he had to do pickup as I packed the lunches. “You have a Zoom?” he said. “My IUD,” I said. We’d had sex only twice in the three weeks since the failed removal. Both times he’d come on my stomach and then looked embarrassed even though we’d been together sixteen years. “I’m sorry,” he’d said each time, and I’d laughed at him. Sophie drove an electric car that was silent. She wore a flannel button-down and Bean Boots, fitted jeans and a wool cap. “Thanks again for doing this,” I said. “I even got to skip drop-off,” she said. Sophie and I had a class together junior year, but it was a large one. We were in the same recitation section. I saw her float past sometimes; Beautiful Partygoer, I’d think, and I’d redden, look down at my oversize sweatshirt, my dirty jeans, feel my face get hot. The last time I saw her, it was late and I was blocks from campus. I did this often, walking around after spending almost the whole day in bed. I had largely stopped attending classes. I was maybe going to get kicked out. That night Sophie looked annoyed and angry. She was lit up by the streetlights, her makeup smudged. “You okay?” I said. She didn’t tell me what had happened. I remember thinking, even as—probably because—she looked so angry, how much power she must have. Thinking I wouldn’t feel how I always felt then if I only looked like that. “Sophie,” I said. “Lizzie,” she said. No one calls me that, I thought. We walked all night, but we didn’t talk about how smudged she was. I wanted, I think, for something awful to have happened. I wanted her to sob, confess some violent interaction. I thought maybe if that happened, she’d have no choice but to be my friend. We talked a long time about nothing, sat on a bench on the East River. We’d both had shitty, fucked-up childhoods, but no worse really than most everyone I talked to then. We both had one very good and very complicated friend who lived in another state and whom we missed. None of it is worth recounting. I knew we probably wouldn’t ever talk again. Eventually she told me that she’d given our TA a blow job after class. She said she hadn’t wanted to, but he kept asking. She twisted her face so that it looked like she was choking. She said she didn’t want to because she hated blow jobs but she’d thought maybe because he was older he’d be able to reciprocate but he did not. She made a joke about the years of study it might take to locate the clitoris. She slipped her dirty feet out of her shoes and turned toward me with her smudgy eyes, which I couldn’t quite look at. A week later, I was in the computer lab close to the sophomore dorm where we all went to do our homework. It was 1999: most kids had computers, but not the way kids have computers now. There was a lounge where people got coffee and hung out, where the internet was more reliable. Someone said Sophie’s name in some context I don’t remember. The tone felt like admiration. “You know she gave her Liberalism and Its Philosophical Critics TA a blow job,” I said. Another girl turned toward me, looked me up and down in the way twenty-year-old girls look one another up and down. I was wearing the same jeans and sweatshirt that I wore almost every day in college. “Who,” she said. “Don,” I said, “the TA in a class we have. She sucked him off.” The night that Sophie and I walked around, she’d used that phrase and I’d said it out loud to myself back in my dorm room. “How would you know?” one of the guys said. I felt hot, started sweating, shrugged, and left. I didn’t leave my dorm for another three weeks, but I felt less small that day. It felt like power, saying what I said. That day at the OB, I walked into the waiting room and said, “All set!” We walked in silence to her silent car, and she looked twice more at me, and I smiled and she smiled back. I’d thrown up three times after the procedure, dry-heaved a few more times after that. It had taken longer than the OB had thought it would and when it was over she let me stay a long time in the procedure room by myself. “Do you want me to put in the other one or do you want to come back?” she said. I didn’t want, maybe ever, to go back there, so I waited half an hour until my body had stopped shaking, until the convulsions in my uterus, the waves of pain, had slowed. Taylor brought me pretzels and a juice box and I said, “Let’s just get this over with.” “It’s much more stuck than I thought,” the OB had said as she pulled and pulled with the camera also up inside me and Taylor worked so hard to stay still beside me, and I went to a place in my brain I am so good at going, where my body stays tense but the pain starts to feel, if not pleasing, then at least familiar and affirming, somehow right. A few months later, David and I were talking. I think it was around my birthday. I always get sort of monstrously depressed around my birthday. The kids had gone to bed and we were up late reading, listening to music. I was in the one chair that David didn’t mind ruining, so I could let the dog sit in my lap. It had started snowing. It felt like goodness, I guess, which is an absurd idea, sitting inside in the warmth like that. I had said something about this, trying to explain it, or maybe I was crying and I felt I needed to explain it, seeing as the night was nice and I didn’t want David to worry, seeing as sometimes he gets exasperated when I cry like that. He looked at me, though, in the way he sometimes looks at me, which I’ve always thought of as his trying, his grasping, even as I know—and it’s one of the reasons that I love him—he won’t ever know what’s happening inside my brain, inside my body, on nights like that. I let the dog fall off my lap and I walked toward him. Jack was sleeping better by then. I straddled David and I kissed him and then I pulled his pants down and we fucked. Whatever it was to walk around with what he had inside him, I wanted to pretend that somehow, another century from now, another million nights like this, a little bit of it might stick. On the drive home, Sophie made a joke, and I thought again of telling her how bad it had been, more painful than either of my labors is what I thought of saying, in part because I thought it might tee her up for another epidural joke and I would laugh again. At one point, Taylor had whispered to me, “It’s never taken her this long, that thing is so stuck,” and I had choked out a sort of laugh. “You’re so tough,” she whispered to me as the OB asked if I needed a break and I said just please get it, and she yanked and yanked and my uterus contracted and more blood came out. They took a bucket of it out of the room after the procedure. Taylor didn’t look at me as she collected all the metal tools. They clanked as she pulled the sopping pads from underneath my ass. I thought of telling Sophie about all of it as we kept driving. I liked her so much. But I didn’t want to watch her face change—it had always seemed so perfect to me—as I talked. ’s most recent novel is The Float Test. She teaches writing at Columbia and Princeton Universities.

        "story": "There was a witch scandal some few years ago in the old port city of Veracruz. “Look how brazen they are now, these sorcerers,” said Valentin Camacho to his young business adviser, Hector Melta. “They offer their services to us in the newspapers.” He showed Hector a notice in the classified-advertising section of El Filibustero. The two men were seated at the window table in Valentin’s restaurant, La Cofa, where they met for their daily conference early, before opening time. They lingered over glasses of milky coffee and browsed through the morning papers. The notice was straightforward enough. A woman calling herself Doña Beatriz was boasting in print that she knew the 144 names of power and how to utter them properly, unbroken in sequence. She was in frequent communion with occult forces and could promise immediate help to those persons standing in need of money, health, beauty, love, courage, popular esteem, a job, fertility, virility, vengeance, or a good car. All confidences were respected. All secrets were locked safely away—tickalock—in the massive bosom of Doña Beatriz. She gave a telephone number in Boca del Río. Hector glanced over the ad, shrugged, and went back to his own newspaper, the more respectable La Corriente, with its statistical pie charts on the front page. He said he took no interest in witches and their fooleries. The ones who weren’t downright frauds were only cracked and wretched old women with delusions. If they could in fact summon and control those dark spirits, then why were they, the witches themselves, not rich and healthy and beautiful? Why would they choose to remain such smelly old hags, muttering in the streets? It was all nonsense, beneath the notice of grown men. Valentin said, “The Rubio Robalito woman is no hag. She has good health and plenty of money.” “Oh, well, Isabel, yes. That’s different. That’s something else again. She is—well, a striking woman, to be sure, always nicely turned out. And she lives high, thanks to Borja. He is generous enough to his mistress. But she only plays at that witchery game. Can’t you see? Isabel likes to dress up in her fine clothes and pretend she is some haughty woman of mystery. That’s all it amounts to. She wants us to think her some sort of abeja reina or maestra.” “So you think she plays a little game.” “I can see well enough, thank you. The blind man is you, Hector, for all your education. Or because of it. You look around and can see nothing but what your professors and your books have told you it is correct to see. Look here, this woman doesn’t sell charms and love potions out of a stall in the Hidalgo Market. She is a practicing witch of the most devilish kind. She has murdered three husbands—that we know of. Three old fools, if you like, for thinking she really wanted to share her bed with some scarecrows. But how many more do you need?” “Oh, don’t tell me that old story has come around again. They died of cholera, Valentin. Old men do die, you know. And there were only two that I recall. Don’t you remember? La Corriente put all that gossip to rest. They showed photographs of the two death certificates on the front page. There they were in black and white—cause of death: cholera.” “Yes, the woman is clever. I give her that. We have a cholera epidemic. She finds herself an old-timer with some money or some insurance or some property. She marries him and then sprinkles rat poison all over his food from a saltshaker with extra-big holes in the top. He dies retching up black stuff, the same as all those people with cholera. Then she has the gall to do it again. And the doctors now, look here, they are working day and night. They don’t have the time for a lot of paperwork. People are dying left and right. They just scribble down ‘cholera’ on all those forms. Those papers mean nothing at all.” “I can see you’ve been brooding over this. You have it all worked out. But you said three husbands. Who was the third one?” “The third one was the very first one—that we know of. Around here on the Gulf, anyway. It was old man Dorantes, down in Alvarado.” “Yes, the old fisherman down there. I had forgotten all about that marriage.” “So has everyone else. It was short enough. Alvarado was where the woman first turned up here on the Gulf. She got off the bus there one afternoon, out of nowhere, and checked into the Hotel Barcelona. And it was there in the hotel barroom that she heard about Dorantes and his two shrimp boats and his money. About how well set up he was. She stood at the bar and drank with the men—no shame whatever, and her a Mexican woman, too, or so she claims. When Dorantes showed up there one afternoon, she introduced herself, just as bold as brass. She made eyes at him. His old knees buckled. He couldn’t believe his luck. So he put his good old wife aside and married the Rubio Robalito woman. He didn’t last long, a month or so. She had him buried in a plywood box not much bigger than a suitcase and cleaned out his bank account and sold his two shrimp trawlers for cash money and came on up here to the city for some fresh pickings.” “But there was something about a monkey.” “Yes, Dorantes had a pet monkey. An old bull monkey called Crespo. Now listen to this. Here was the woman’s tale. One night at home, after supper, the old man and Crespo got into a good-natured scuffle over the last one of the little cakes on the table. Crespo had his own high chair at that supper table. They tussled around. Dorantes, you know, he wasn’t much bigger than a monkey himself. So here they are now, on the floor, wrestling over a little gingerbread pig. Then Crespo bit Dorantes on the thumb. The old fellow suddenly took sick and died forty minutes later of monkey fever, raving and flopping about on his bed.” “So fast? Forty minutes after a playful nip on the thumb?” “That was the woman’s story, Hector.” “What is monkey fever, anyway?” Valentin shouted across the breadth of the empty restaurant to Rafael, an ancient gnome who was the senior waiter. “Rafael! Call the nuthouse! Tell those people to get over here pronto in their white vans and take Hector away! He believes old man Dorantes died of monkey fever! He wants to put Crespo the monkey in prison!” But Rafael with his catlike dignity never deigned to turn his head when his name was spoken, nor would he respond at once to the sharp handclap or the ding of spoon on glass from an impatient diner. Hector said, “All right, then. Say there is a pattern. Where does your witchcraft come in? What you’re describing sounds like an ordinary criminal matter to me. So why haven’t the police looked into it?” “Because that woman scares them out of their boots, Hector. That’s why. They look the other way. And besides, policemen don’t know anything about poisons. When she starts using an axe they might take some notice.” “But if Isabel really does have these demonic powers, then why would she have to feed arsenic to her husbands like ordinary wives? Why couldn’t she just cast spells and strike them dead on the spot?” “She could, at a heavy cost to her own health, and not on the spot even then. Death spells are hard to work. They take time. Conditions have to be right. A waning moon in the right quarter. All those little things from her kit have to be lined up just so on her altar. Her rare gums that she burns, and those consecrated wafers that she stole from Holy Souls Church. It’s a wonder they don’t scorch her fingers. Ask the Monseñor, he can tell you all about it, and about some missing holy oil, too. Can you imagine? Making off with the Host itself! And then, look here, to work her spell she would have to chant hard words all night long, with every word in the right place. Why would she bother with all that? She takes her opportunities where she finds them.”  They went back to their newspapers. Rafael topped up their glasses from two steaming kettles, one of coffee and the other of milk. His little hands were gnarled now but had not lost their touch. He poured fast from high above each glass, and then with a snap of the hands he cut off the flow clean from the spouts. No droplet fell astray. A bit later Hector broke the silence with what suddenly occurred to him as a telling point. “You’re forgetting something, Valentin. The old Capitán married Isabel and he lived to tell the tale.” “Escaped to tell it, you mean. He had to slip away from her in the night and leave the country in an airplane. The old Capitán now, yes, he is a fine man. He has his honor. But he couldn’t see what he was getting into with that woman. Then one day he did see it and he knew his only chance to live was to steal away from her in the night. I will remind you that he didn’t come back from Galveston, Texas, until the divorce was final. When she had no more claim on his property.” “What property would that be? All he has is his retirement pension from the Navy, and as far as I know... that can’t amount to much. Hardly enough to attract avaricious women.” “I don’t know the ins and outs of it. Maybe he has some insurance. Or maybe she was interested in his social position. I haven’t figured out that part of it yet. Not even Flaco can get to the bottom of it.” “At least we know why he left her. No mystery there.” “Oh? I wonder if you do know.” “I heard he left her because it took her three hours to get ready for bed every night.” “Yes, that was the story he put out. Still, it was true enough, the three-hour business, and he knew that would be solid grounds for the divorce. But that wasn’t why he flew away in a fast airship in the middle of the night. Have you ever looked closely at that woman’s neck?” “Isabel’s neck? No.” “Take a good look at her neck sometime. Her throat. It is the neck of a girl. Why hasn’t it started going stringy? That woman has not aged one day in nine years. No one knows how old she really is.” “Well, aren’t there these special night creams that women use?” “No, no, don’t talk to me about your neck creams and your special night creams. You will always come up with something lame and pitiful like that to explain away a strange business. Listen to me, Hector. This happened up in Xalapa just a few months ago. The Rubio Robalito woman was there, on God only knows what business. She was walking across the Juárez Park. A small boy came riding along on a bicycle and splashed a little water on her leg from a puddle. That very night she worked a hex on him—on a child, mind you. His little fingers and toes rotted away from the tips down until they all dropped off. Flaco was telling me about it, and he knows an uncle of the boy.” “Ah, Flaco. I might have known. Flaco and his boy with paws. But why all this talk about Isabel? What are you driving at? You’ve got witches on the brain. I’m not getting the drift of this.” “That woman has been looking at me. I don’t like it. She has no business looking at me and smiling at me. Something is going on, I tell you. I can smell something burning.” “Looking at you where?” “Everywhere. Out on the streets, the plaza, the market. She will catch sight of me from a block away and stop dead in her tracks and smile that little smile at me.” “But her dark glasses. How do you know she is looking at you?” “By the way she cocks her head. You can tell, all right, from the set of her head. And now on top of everything else she is interfering with my sleep.” “How does she do that?” “I don’t know how she does it, but when I’m sleeping she puts ugly pictures in my head of five or six hairy demons. I wake up just shaking all over like a wet dog.” “What are the demons doing?” “Nothing. Just squatting, drooling there and grinning at me. They have no business grinning at me. It was Borja who put that woman up to all this. You can count on it.” “Borja, yes, of course. Now I see. He has to be behind everything. You’ve got Borja on the brain, too.” “He is behind more things in this town than you know. You can’t deny that he threw up that big ugly building across the street just to spite me and block off my morning light. You don’t know the man.” “I know him well enough, and yes, he likes to annoy you, but I can’t believe he would build a seven-story office building on a whim like that. You flatter yourself. Borja doesn’t spend that kind of money unless he is sure of a good return.” “That woman is working a spell on me and he put her up to it.” II. Various stories about the Rubio Robalito woman—older ones, somewhat improved upon over time, and ever new ones—were told and retold around the city. It was said that she could raise a storm at sea, placing the fishing boats in peril, and that she could lay waste to field crops by raising a plague of weevils and cankerworms; that she slept with her eyes open, and that her sleep, like that of a house cat, ran to eighteen hours a day; that she was a morphine addict; that she had six toes on one foot, and that she had a black mole in the shape of a toad’s foot behind one knee; that she had an albino daughter, abandoned at birth; that she had strangled her mother, also a witch and a prostitute, in Mexico City, then set fire to the bed on which the mother lay still; that she had fled to Veracruz by rail, when the passenger trains were still running, carrying her mother’s grimoire and Master Rufino in a satchel punctured with air holes; that her father was a French diplomat in Mexico City, that her father was a French baker in Mexico City, that her father was not French at all but rather a common pickpocket in Mexico City; that she could touch any hard, smooth object with her fingertips while blindfolded and tell the color of that object; that a Mexico City police detective from the Expulsion Bureau had put her on a bus with a one-way ticket to Catemaco, “the city of witches,” south of Veracruz, with a warning never to return, whence her recent appearance on the Gulf Coast; that she had married a drug dealer called Popo in Mexico City, then murdered him during their honeymoon on the Isla del Carmen, whence her recent appearance on the coast; that she was a nature lover and had traveled to the forested mountains rising above the Gulf, to await with glee the arrival of the migrating monarch butterflies, whence her recent appearance on the coast; that she had married an American dope peddler in San Miguel de Allende by the name of Monroe Beede, also known to the police as Budro Beede, Cedro Beede, Spider Beede, Skeeter Beede, Booger Red Beede and Roger Dale Beede and Wardell Beade, then strangled him with a loop of wire on their honeymoon bed in the fragrant, vanilla-bean town of Papantla, whence her recent appearance on the Gulf; that she had command over a band of demons the size of mice living beneath the docks; that she had command over eight or nine unclean spirits in the Gulf states of Veracruz and Tabasco; that she could transliterate the night cries of birds and frogs and insects into comprehensible if repetitious bird statements and frog statements and bug statements in the Spanish language; that her sorceries and curses were effective only on that fifth Friday in a month with five Fridays; and so on. She, Isabel, was incapable of laughing or weeping. When she saw or heard something that struck her as being ridiculous she gave only a little grunt. On hearing that last rumor she gave just such a grunt, followed by a piggish snort of contempt. The old Capitán’s marriage to Isabel Rubio Robalito was a brief and strange affair, not to mention his midnight flight from the marriage bed and the subsequent divorce. As for the courtship, it was she, Isabel, having social aspirations and living in a city where the social standing of witches was quite low, who had made the first move. Her only reading matter, apart from the tattered leaves of her mother’s grimoire, an old conjure book of spells and incantations, was the society section of La Corriente. Every Sunday morning she bought a copy of the newspaper at a kiosk near the zócalo. She extracted the society pages and dumped all the rest into a trash barrel. Then she sought out an empty bench in the park, as far away as possible from the bandstand, and settled in. She pored over the photographs of debutantes and brides, as well as those of the well-burnished matrons who presided over the holiday balls, masked balls, charity balls, banquets, levees, seasonal galas, and other festive affairs in the city. She came to know the names of those sleek older hostesses, and even some of their nicknames. She even came to know something about the correct seating arrangements for these gatherings. Isabel read every word of the society news, saving the best for last, and the best, by far, was the popular gossip column called “Whispers... from Lupita.” In one of her recent Whispers, Lupita had made it known that a Navy Capitán of flag rank or higher, active or retired, was automatically invited to all social events of any importance in Veracruz. Isabel took note of this tidbit in a casual way. A few days later, on seeing a laughing, elderly gentleman coming out of the post office, the importance of the tidbit finally registered and stopped her cold in her tracks. Wasn’t he the one they called “the old Capitán”? Here was her entrée! Yes, of course! Her ticket to the balls! It was destiny! So it was that she made a play for “the old Capitán,” as he was known fondly to one and all, rich and poor, to young and old alike. A widower twice over, and long retired from the Mexican Navy, he was still something of a ladies’ man, even at his age. He strolled about the old city with his cane and a smile and a friendly word of greeting for everyone along the way. In his gait there remained the faint touch of a rolling swagger. The old boulevardier responded at once to Isabel’s flirtation signals, gallantly pretending that it was he who had initiated the wooing. But then the woman had second thoughts. She held back from marrying him. Something wasn’t quite right here. She kept getting a confusing reply from her divinations into the matter, thus—C is wrong but C is right. Her trance-writing was guided, as she knew well, by emanations from the big yellow cat with the yellow eyes, Master Rufino, he being her familiar spirit and those being the words her fountain pen kept spelling out, over and over again. What to make of such a riddle? Oracular revelations are expected to be ambiguous but this one appeared to be self-contradictory. “C” would have to be the old Capitán—that was clear enough—but how could he be both wrong and right as a husband? And there was no mistaking the words. All the emanating syllables rang clear in her head, as she took care to jot them down verbatim, in blue-black ink, which is to say the ink wrote blue and dried black. She was likewise faithful in keeping a daily record, in a different spiral-wire notebook, of Rufino’s tiny and all but inaudible emissions of gas. So, what then to do? Usually so decisive, she wavered. She had misgivings. She continued to see the old sailor but brushed aside his proposals of marriage—until that strange night when he whispered to her that he was one of the Five Proud Walkers, and nor was he the least of them. He showed her a small golden key, engraved on one side with a sunburst emblem, the wavy rays of which suggesting a kind of glory. This, he explained, was no functional or ordinary key, but it was rather a symbolic key of great age, older than the carved stone heads of the Olmecs. It was the badge of his high office. There were only five such keys in the world. Few eyes had ever seen one and no woman had ever gazed upon this one. But now, as a mark of his devotion, he would permit her, Isabel, to hold the little talisman in the palm of her hand for a moment or two. Perhaps, in squeezing it, she could feel the tingle of its potency. She said yes, she thought she could sense a sort of... prickle. He swore her to silence. Brutal punishment would follow hard any breach of this confidence. His life was at stake as well as hers. The pair of them would be hacked up with machetes and their bloody remains flung to a pack of street dogs. Then he softened the tone of things with a smile, as he proposed a loving pledge. They toasted each other, arms awkwardly entwined, with glasses of red wine. It was a betrothal pledge. Isabel was stupefied. Who could have foreseen such a thing, a Proud Walker? A strange moment indeed. The very air seemed to be charged and something was pulsing. What? Blood? Was there not also a faint hum? Did coursing blood hum? For all her vanity and extravagant ambition she had never dared to think that she might one day meet in the flesh, much less embrace, a Proud Walker. And yet here was one. Or was he? This shuffling old fellow a Proud Walker? This old man with his enormous ears and with his head settling ever lower between his shoulders—of all people! And here in Veracruz—of all places! But then no one could say with much confidence just where, at a given moment, a Proud Walker might be, or just who might be one. They were a cabal, these Five, a camarilla of nameless and faceless men who were believed to be the ultimate rulers of Mexico. But just who were they? One theory had it that the Five were Jesuit priests, or perhaps defrocked, apostate Jesuits. Another theory held that they were Freemasons, possibly renegade Masons, members of a breakaway lodge, the smallest and most exalted lodge of Scottish Rite Freemasons in the world. Still another claimed they ruled from an underground room with high bronze doors, beneath the Chapultepec Hill in the very heart of Mexico City. As for the apparent government of Mexico—or so the theory went—it was nothing more than an elaborate sham structure of sticks, cardboard, and painted canvas. It was a mere puppet show of elections, with dummy presidents, senators, and the like going through their scripted paces. It was all a colorful but empty pageant which served to entertain the people and keep the lawyers occupied with endless artificial disputes and to provide daily political fodder for the journalists, with their furrowed brows. Isabel saw at once how foolish she had been to imagine the Five as haughty bravos in the prime of life, swaggering about in public five abreast with their insolent heads thrown back as they drove ordinary folk off the sidewalks—and perhaps off cliffs, as well, for sport. No, “Proud Walker” was almost certainly a poetic term, not to be construed literally. As governors of the nation they must necessarily be older men of experience. They would be the wise men, the tribal elders. And they would have to be somewhere, even here on the Gulf, just as they would have to find their wives somewhere. Why not here? And as for the old Capitán, he did have a certain hidalgo air about him. His was a felt presence. He was a natural-born don of some kind. And who better than she, Isabel, daughter of Belial, handmaiden to Asmodeus and beloved of Baal, to serve with her regal bearing as his consort? Things were at last falling into place. She had fetched up here in this sweltering old city to meet her high destiny. After a civil marriage service, quite brief and cold-blooded, the two lovers took a bus to Boca del Río, just a few kilometers down the coast, for their honeymoon. It was all something of a disappointment to Isabel. They traveled in a decrepit shuttle bus, an old American school bus, still yellow here and there, and in a driving rainstorm. They did manage to find adjoining seats but could not escape being jostled and breathed on by the standing passengers. And even dripped on by soaked and steaming passengers who came aboard out of the rain. Progress was slow. The bus stopped frequently, on being hailed at any point along the way. Isabel said to herself: I have married another old man with no car. “I know Boca well,” the old sailor had said. “Leave all the arrangements to me. Allow me to surprise you. I am going to show you the best-kept secret in Mexico. Such food! Some very nice people go there—refined ladies, you know, clean feeders as a rule, with dainty table manners—and they just gobble that food down like hogs at a trough. That’s how good it is. They stuff it down till you think they must pop. Oh my—wouldn’t that be something?—a series of damp pops under the table. Everyone stops gobbling for a moment and looks about for the source of the muffled popping. And do you know what you are going to say? Oh yes, with those first few bites your eyes will sparkle and you will turn to me and just blurt it out—‘Yum, yum!’”  The surprise was that they would be staying not in the bridal suite of a luxury hotel on the beach, but in a small bedroom of a downtown boardinghouse. The dining room there was long and narrow. Ranged along the walls at eye level there were framed newspaper clippings, which featured photographs of singers, dancers, athletes, politicians, actors, and other laughing celebrities, who, it was implied in the text, ate here at every opportunity. But they were back-number celebrities of another day, unfamiliar to Isabel, and it was somehow clear that these luminaries were no longer dancing, singing, boxing, laughing, or indeed eating anywhere at all these days—that they were in fact all now quite dead. Some glint of life had faded from their eyes. Or it may only have been the overall sepia tint of the news clippings that dated the celebrities so. The meals were served family style at a long communal table and at fixed times. “But what meals!” said the old Capitán. “It’s the best cooking to be found on the Gulf of Mexico! Ten times better than that overpriced hotel slop! Twenty times!” Isabel sat fuming in silence. She was disgusted by the liberties these people took, and much annoyed with her old husband. Why would he invite these familiarities from such nobodies? III. Alfonso Borja was sitting alone at his new oval desk of dark mahogany in his new penthouse office atop his new seven-story Borja Building. The office was a rotunda in form, mounted on a turntable. A heavy rain had swept in off the Gulf and was beating down with a terrible clamor on the glass dome above his head—which crystal cap topped off this very modern Edificio Borja. He kept craning his head about with alarm, being fearful of water leaks and bolts of lightning. Hard man of business though he was, he had never really managed to hold his architects, with all their self-indulgent fooleries, in check. He was disgusted. How could any work possibly get done here at an egg-shaped desk in a rotating room under a glass roof? The bolt from the blue, however, came not from the heavens but rather from a private telephone. Dazed somewhat, Borja listened to the caller without saying much. Then the line went dead and he placed the beige telephone back into its cradle. So—amazing news then—if true. He considered the possibility that the caller had been a prankster, or some personal enemy playing him a dirty trick. And yet, on the whole, no, he thought not. That confident voice, however much reduced so as to make its way along a copper wire, had a certain pitch of authority in it. But how did the fellow get through to this telephone? Not even Borja’s wife had the number. No one, in theory, knew the number of this most private of his several telephones except for himself, his lawyer, his current mistress, as well as his former mistress, Estela, who remained his confidential secretary. The caller was a stranger with a harsh Monterrey accent who gave his name simply as “Brother Enrique.” He said he was calling from Mexico City on a matter of some urgency, and that, without further ado, he was pleased to notify Señor Borja that he was in. Borja said, “In? What am I in? How did you get this number?” “Yes, permit me to explain. For almost a year now your name has been at the top of our short list—shortest of short lists—of candidates for the office of Proud Walker. We never use the word ‘vacancy,’ but in the event of a death among our Five, the man holding that top position on the list automatically becomes the successor. And, earlier today, at 7:23 am, one of our older Brothers, while doddering across the Reforma Promenade, was struck down and killed by a speeding motor scooter. And there you have it—ignominious death by red scooter. That will give you some idea of his frailty. So, Señor Borja—or now, more correctly, Brother Alfonso—you have been a Proud Walker since early this morning. Thus does our Eternal Five remain intact.” “Hold it. Wait a minute. Are you telling me that I am now one of the Five Proud Walkers?” “That is just what I am telling you. As of the last exhalation of our older Brother early this morning. Strictly speaking, there can be no vacancy. Ours is a self-perpetuating body. Immortal, if you will. We exist outside of time. The replacement procedure is self-activated and immediate. Well, something of a convenient legal fiction there, I will concede, since you are not yet an effective Proud Walker. There is always a bit of a gap. Still, you were listed on our active muster roll as of early today, and very soon indeed you will be seated in your own Oak Chair.” “I didn’t even know I was being considered.” “No one knows until he is actually tapped, and you must regard this call as that metaphorical tap on the shoulder. The old Brother is out, in more ways than one, and you, Brother Alfonso, are in.” “Who was the old fellow?” “Oh, you would know the name, if I could reveal it. Quite a well-known figure at one time. In any case, that’s all water under the bridge. No real loss, I hasten to say. A blessing, really. He was senile, demented, deranged. Not exactly a nullity, but close, close. Proud Walker indeed. Shuffling mummy is more like it. And the man had lost all sense of propriety. He would snort and snore through our most solemn conclaves, then wake with a start and give a little chirping cry of fright. So much for decorum.” “Why didn’t you retire him, or just give him the boot?” Brother Enrique laughed. “‘Give him the boot,’ the man says. I like that. Yes, you will bring a healthy candor to our deliberations. Just what we need, a man of the world, bluff and straightforward. But, alas, we cannot give anyone the boot, as you put it. Lifetime appointments, you see. No provision for removal from office, short of death, and no provision for euthanasia. Neither is there any provision for amending our Articles of Foundation. Carved in stone, they are. And there you have the weakness of our ancient Articles. Still, we manage. We are not quite so dotard-heavy as you might expect. And for all that, the old fellow, the recently deceased, did serve, if only as ballast, by way of filling a Chair. And his death comes at an awkward time, this being one of our busy seasons, when we are preparing our quarterly directives, both regional and national. So it is imperative that the office be filled at once. No official business can go forward, you see, until we are all well and truly seated in our Five Oak Chairs.” “Why couldn’t four do the job? Or even three?” “Not possible. Our laws are fixed in stone, as I told you, and not one jot or tittle of them can be effaced, not even by our chief, the Wrathful Prince himself.” “Your chief is a wrathful prince?” “No, no, he is the Wrathful Prince. El Jefe Máximo. Our chief executive officer. Primus inter pares. The first among five equals. The first among five caudillos, you see.” “How does that work? A caudillo, yes, the boss, I understand that very well, by way of being one myself. But five caudillos? How could that possibly work?” “A rota. We have a rotating leadership. Five caudillos, yes, but only one Wrathful Prince at a given time. And during that time the Four must defer and submit to discipline. Clear enough?” “Not really.” “Well, if he, the Wrathful Prince, comes in and sees that we do not have a quorum, or rather a plenum, he will say, ‘What, do I see an empty chair? Fewer than Five Proud Walkers on deck? Then I must declare these proceedings suspended and adjourned sine die.’ But now, Brother Alfonso, let us get back to your own accession. The first thing you are going to need is a signet ring.” “A ring? Who is this? Do I know you? How did you get this number? What kind of ring are you talking about? You are going much too fast for me.” “My sincere apologies. Things have been hectic here in the Deep Chamber since early this morning and I am a limp rag. Here I am, just babbling away. And no, we have not met, though I feel I know you quite well. You have been under our scrutiny for some time now and we like what we see.” “Do you people use a secret language? That I will have to learn?” “No, no, nothing like that. Castilian Spanish is good enough for us. It is the only language for gentlemen. Of course we do have our passwords and countersigns. And you will be taught our hand signals of greeting and warning, that sort of silent communication. Our intricate handclasps and our winks and nods of alarm.” “How much is all this going to cost me?” Brother Enrique laughed again. “Right to the point! ‘How much will it cost?’ Right to the heart of things! But have you ever stopped to consider, Brother Alfonso, that there may be a few things in this world with no price tag?” “You find my question offensive?” “I think you spoke before you thought.” “Well, all this is quite an honor, of course, but surely I am entitled to know—” “At this stage of things you are entitled to know just what we see fit to tell you, nothing more. And, if I may say so, it’s a double honor that is being bestowed upon you. First, the high honor of being a Proud Walker, and then the unique distinction of being the first Proud Walker from the venerable old city of Veracruz, four times heroic—or is it five? An outrage, of course, that the fine men of our brave old city, oldest of our Spanish cities here, have been overlooked until now, but there it is. And I must tell you that we are strictly forbidden to utter the word dinero, money, when we are sitting in council. Not done. Sacrilege. Defilement. But where there is a will there can usually be found a way, and we are not specifically denied the use of synonyms for that taboo word. You may rest assured that the material benefits accruing to you as a Proud Walker will be substantial. And we will leave it at that. Now, let me say that your initial out-of-pocket expense will be nominal. The cost of a silver ring and the cost of a few silken items—sashes and the like—which we wear on formal occasions. Now then, will you be needing an emergency loan to cover these trifling expenses? With perhaps a little extra on the side to tide you over?” “Certainly not. I could buy and sell the lot of you twice over and never miss the money. But I must have things clear in my head before I make a move. What kind of ring are you talking about?” “A silver ring for your left ring finger. A heavy ring, gem-set, of no great intrinsic value. In tomorrow’s express mail you will receive a fire opal of an oblong, baguette cut, engraved with a ram’s head. That is our signet, which makes a clean impression in sealing wax. Have your jeweler melt down an old milled Spanish dollar, a piece of eight, for the casting of the ring itself. Those old coins assay out, I believe, at around .800fine, which is eighty percent silver and the rest copper. This alloy gives our rings just the right heft and just the right subdued luster. No cheap sheen. In that package with the opal you will also find a drawing, to scale, of the ring itself. Have your jeweler prepare it to the exact specifications, as given, and then insert the opal into the setting, as shown. Tell him the stone is an old family heirloom, nothing more. Are we clear so far?” “Well, I suppose so, but I don’t quite see—” “But you do understand, don’t you, that you must not disclose one word of this conversation to anyone?” “Certainly.” “Not to your wife, not to your old Mother Borja, not to your confessor priest—to no one at all. Breach of confidence—that is the scarlet sin, the cardinal and unforgivable sin of our fraternal ethos. And a word of warning about imposters. Only I, Brother Enrique, have been cleared to speak directly to you. Hang up at once on any other caller representing himself as a Proud Walker. Meanwhile, I want you to think about ice. You savvy ice?” “What? No, I don’t. Ice?” “Big square blocks of frozen water. Ice is the key to empire. Surely you savvy key, a master key. Well, never mind, the answer will come to you soon enough, out of the mist, in the form of a small soft glowing ball. Understood? Good. Now, in view of our emergency, I will be frank and tell you that your accession rites must be curtailed somewhat. Don’t worry, I can promise you that neither the dignity nor the efficacy of the ceremony will be diminished. Oh yes, I pulled rank, and put my foot down on that point! You can count on it! It’s just that the processional and recessional movements of the investiture will be trimmed a bit, and with not quite so many blazing candles. And fewer drumrolls, you know, and fewer trumpet fanfares, with shorter accolades, shorter poems, that sort of thing. But the essential dignity, the essential gravity of it all, is being preserved. Now, do I have your consent to go forward with this? Well, of course I do, that goes without saying, so we need not linger there. Just a bit of boilerplate formality. Yes, I think we can take that as read and endorsed. What else now? Let’s see here. Do you have a spinal deformity of any kind?” “No, I don’t.” “Frequent convulsions?” “None at all, no.” “Any missing limbs or withered limbs?” “No.” “Any major business reverses within the past five years?” “No.” “Have formal complaints ever been lodged against you concerning your personal hygiene?” “Certainly not.” “Now then, what is all this here about your orthopedic boot?” “My what?” “Or perhaps I should say boots. It is not made clear here whether you wear one or two of these—heavy black corrective shoes.” “I don’t wear any such thing.” “Then why... or no, wait... now I see, yes... I am looking at the wrong curriculum vitae! Not yours at all! It’s that of some hopeless fellow by the name of Borro! How foolish! What you must think of me! I am just so rattled this morning, what with this cascade of paperwork. But bear with me, we’re almost done for the day. I am trying to squeeze so much into this one call. Oh yes, and this is vitally important—the menacing caution. I almost forgot. If you speak of this call to anyone, you can abandon all hope. Within twenty-four hours you will be bludgeoned to death with ball-peen hammers. Understood? Not a peep. Is that clear?” “Quite clear.” “Then permit me in closing to be the first Proud Walker to offer you a hearty welcome into the ranks of our Ever Unbroken Circle. With the warmest of felicitations. And on that happy note I really must run. Extended telephone conversations are dangerous, so vulnerable to wiretappers. Goodbye for now, Brother Alfonso. You will be hearing from me again soon.” Borja said, “Wait, how can I reach you? How did you get this number?” But there was a click and the voice was gone. Brother Enrique was gone. Borja sat stupefied at his big desk. Rain was still drumming away on the glass dome overhead. Down in the streets, far below, the just pedestrians and the unjust pedestrians alike were getting soaked as they scurried about for shelter. A prank call? Perhaps, but he thought not. A bit too circumstantial for a hoaxter. And besides, why shouldn’t he be a Proud Walker—a man of his position, his riches, his accomplishments? And, come to that, why the delay? Those Proud Walker people had taken their own sweet time in getting around to him. This recognition was, after all, no more than his due, and long overdue at that. Still, there was no denying that this dignity was a high one, and that it might well serve to place his name, at long last, into the exclusive reference book called Nosotros—pronoun, first-person plural, which is to say, Ourselves, We, Us. This slender and expensive volume, bound in soft red leather, was a compendium of biographical summaries of the socially notable families in Mexico, of la gente de bien, the elite, the aristocracy of blood, not of wealth as such, and Borja knew, to his slight embarrassment, that you could not buy your way into the vellum pages of that Mexican Almanach de Gotha. And yet, seeing as how he was now sworn to silence, how were they to learn of his elevation to the Proud Five? Surely they would just know these things, wouldn’t they? Men of their eminence. Word would get around. Whispered confidences would be exchanged in that exalted loop of insiders. A secret in Mexico has the life of a mayfly. Such was the folk wisdom. But was it true? Borja was well informed. He had prime sources of gossip and he paid well for choice morsels—financial, social, political, criminal. But he did not know the baptismal name of a single Proud Walker. So much for that received wisdom. Perhaps he would have to see to it personally that word of his high appointment got around. A man of his stature could hardly be bound to the letter of some petty legalism. But what if his breach should become known? What then? Public humiliation? Forfeiture of all his money and property to the Brotherhood? Would the Proud Walkers drum him out of the club with some shameful and disgusting ritual? Strangle him with a silken rope until his tongue protruded? Hack him about with ceremonial knives—the death of a thousand cuts—and dump his body near the Isla de Sacrificios for the sharks to finish off? He would have to give careful thought to his next moves, and step ever so slightly, what with all these snares and pitfalls before him. The Nosotros people had returned Borja’s bribe money to him with no comment, only scornful silence, but the sting of the snub had not gone very deep. Borja had the hide of a crocodile. It was, after all, their loss. A temporary setback. His time would come. They were stupid, all those soft and pampered aristos who had blackballed him. For Borja knew that, whatever the measuring rod, he was one set apart. In time, they would be honored by his presence.

        "story": "A ten-minute coffee break was called on set, time Laura used to continue her keen, proprietary staking out of those lives she might still be permitted to lead, and those which were no longer possible. She saw the assistant in her puffer coat handing steaming coffees to the crew, indicating that filming would soon begin. Then her more threatening significance, only somewhat obscured by the bulky outerwear: thin wrists emerged from the sleeves, chin-length hair dyed crimson poured from the hood along with a face that was young and patient, ringing with good cheer. Laura, a few weeks away from turning thirty, could not be quite that young again, but she could still wait patiently for the professional milestones that would one day accrue to her, be gracious and charming on her way up, even feign laughter at her co-workers’ compulsively genial remarks before they all headed out for the weekend. Although these co-workers, if you could even call them that, were always rotating in and out of the short-lived gigs that she was also rotating through, and so they hardly seemed worth the trouble. She’d held down odd jobs for so many years that the cycle had congealed into a routine. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays she wrote ad copy, usually at home with little oversight; the work always took less time than they gave her to complete it. For years she’d written copy for movie posters and viral campaigns (lines like “This Christmas, payback won’t be cheap” and “Love happens when you least expect it”), although for the past few months she’d been reassigned from theatrical releases to the concession stand. Coca-Cola had hired the firm for some contract work and her boss was throwing just about everyone at it. Between these thrillingly lucrative hours of corporate idling, she doctored treatments for other people’s immature attempts at TV pilots or films—students and other amateurs whose hopes outmatched their talents. This she did less for the pay (which was pitiful) than for the vague notion that industry contacts would materialize bearing funds and distribution for one of her own screenplays, several of which inched along in the evening hours—and there they remained. It seemed to Laura that her scripts had begun to grow frail in the dark. Yet still she counted on their eventual unveiling, and on the grandest possible platform: the silver screen. First the festivals, then New York and L.A., then the world would bear witness to her childhood fears, her daily passions and frustrations, her minutely observed existence, all tastefully packaged within, for instance, a buddy comedy or an interplanetary embezzlement plot. Laura showed these developing screenplays to only one person, her boyfriend, Mark. They’d met shortly after she’d moved to the city, when she was a year out of college and he was beginning a doctorate in psychiatry. Seven years had passed since then, and he still handed back her works in progress gingerly spotted with black pen on sheets printed out on the campus where he lectured once a week. It stoked her delicate sense of accomplishment that, although he was five years older than her, Mark had been attending school throughout their relationship and was only just now venturing into what she conceived of as the “real world,” where she had held court—or at least held down jobs—all these years. “Finally we’re both doctors,” she’d say to him with a one-sided smile like a fake nudge in the ribs. And yet certain dynamics between them eluded her. Like that all this time, there’d been this other world, the intimate sphere of their relationship, in which she had been the one getting her papers graded. Mark made every effort to bestow praise on Laura’s work, encouraging her to go forth boldly and gather collaborators for her drafts in the public forum, the marketplace of ideas, social media. “Sometimes it’s good to be pushy!” he would say. But neither of them was. Between them flowed acceptance, calm, and the unspoken expectation of a tomorrow. Also, on any given evening, about a mile and a half of foot traffic. They lived in separate studio apartments, two subway stops away from each other, which Mark insisted suited him fine. He had asked to move in with her once, but that was years ago. Laura said it was for his sake as well as hers that they lived apart. Her habit of working late into the night might inconvenience him, leave him sleepless, or worse: whatever injury she inflicted upon him could one day be dumped by way of the transitive property onto his patients, whom she pictured as blank, hapless individuals standing in the streets, staring at the sky with enormous cow’s eyes, waiting for anvils to drop onto their heads. They were the ones disasters struck. She was the one who made every effort to forestall a bad result. She was careful with money and steadfast in her creative practice. The desk in which she kept her drafts was a wobbly wooden antique, a fully biodegradable item she’d acquired for next to nothing. The actors with fresh cigarettes burning began to descend from their trailers, drawing closer to the set like a swarm of lightning bugs. The crew was keeping warm in a smoke shop. The scene would take place outside on the snow-covered street, as well as in a bar down the block. It would be a short film in color, “but it should feel black-and-white, like a paperback novel,” insisted the director, who typically shot fashion campaigns in studios and shifted uneasily in the real snow. Laura rolled her eyes from behind the foggy glass panel of the storefront window. The idea the director had proposed to Laura, once they’d been put in touch by a photography student of his at Parsons for whom Laura had done a bit of writing, was to shoot the film from the vantage point of an inhuman and ubiquitous force. Something heaven-sent or heaven-bound, which he referred to as “fate.” It was Laura’s job to transform the director’s abstract vision into a storyline that audiences could digest. Not only to write the script, but to communicate its subtleties to the actors and ensure they didn’t get too creative with improvisations. But the director hadn’t been making any of this easy for her. “A divine force caresses the mortal world,” he had told Laura over Zoom the previous month. (The plot concerned two young strangers who venture out on an awkward first date one snowy Brooklyn night.) He spoke slightly warped English with a mild Parisian accent. “It’s on account of this divine force, this fate,” continued the director, “that I don’t film the faces of the two young people falling in love at all. I used to be obsessed with faces, but now I’m completely over them. Recently, at my day work, I was experimenting with asking the models to close their eyes or cover their faces with a visually arresting object, such as a vase of flowers or a lockbox. Of course, the clients all hate this. They say, ‘Pierre, please focus.’ They say, ‘The point is not to observe a beautiful young girl holding a pink grapefruit in front of her head, the point is to sell vegan-leather harnesses to wealthy twenty-year-olds.’ I am developing early-onset arthritis from clenching my fists all day. So I will make my own films. You see?” The assistant approached Laura, holding a hot coffee between two mittens. “No, thanks,” said Laura. “I’m one of those horrible tea drinkers.” “Oh yeah, I heard about you guys on the news,” said the assistant. “Real sick individuals. But, no, this one’s mine.” The assistant wasn’t as compliant and bubbly as Laura had assumed moments earlier. In fact, her deadpan tone and lackadaisical manner were a lot like Laura’s. “We’re a presumptuous lot, us tea drinkers, but helpful. Can I help you with something?” “Just wanted to say hi. I’m Sophie. It’s my first time working with this director, and everyone else here.” “I’m pretty sure it’s his first film,” said Laura, nodding at the director, who was smoking a cigarette while munching on a snowball. “And it could be a one-time thing, if you know what I mean.” “Right, I gather. Anyway, he wouldn’t want me back—I screwed up his coffee order earlier.” Laura inwardly smirked at the characteristic self-doubt of a woman some eight years her junior. “Nobody remembers a thing like that.” “I’ll remember it,” Sophie shot back, unfazed by the hint of condescension, if she’d even picked up on it. “He asked for cold coffee. Cold, not iced. He said it should ‘retain the memory of having once been warm.’” “Jesus.” “Yeah. I panicked and added two sugars. But, oh well. I hear he’ll be turning fifty soon.” “Mon dieu. You wouldn’t know it to look at him. He’s creased, yet boyish.” “Here I thought he was just vain. You’re Laura, right?” “I am. Have we met?” “That actor guy Dorian pointed you out,” said Sophie, not bothering to scan for him. “He said he doesn’t know anyone here either, except you. I realized talking to him that you and I have a friend in common.” Laura highly doubted this. She had only a few friends and was a micro-generation older than this woman, which surely meant something in the real world. “Terry McNaught,” said Sophie. “Excuse me?” “Terry McNaught.” “Afraid I don’t know such a person.” “I’m not wrong about this. You’re dating Psychiatrist Mark who lives on Halsey Street with the dog with the thyroid issue.” “Yes.” “And you’re close with Terry McNaught.” “No.” “Terry and I worked together on the student-debt-abolition campaign like a million years ago.” “That’s cool. But I don’t know this person, so... let’s leave it,” Laura suggested, with faux kindness. “You’re mistaken.” A conspiratorial comprehension dawned on Sophie’s pristine forehead. Laura did not like it one bit. “Okay,” said Sophie. “It’s early in the relationship. I get it. I never open up about anything unless I feel like it. My family doesn’t even know I drink coffee.” “And the only thing you know about me is that I drink tea. I’ve been with Mark for seven years. It’s this Terry McNaught character I know nothing about.” That last comment seemed to send Sophie reeling. She leaned forward and the pace of her words quickened. Laura, absorbed by this sudden change, also bent closer. From a distance the two women in their big coats could almost be mistaken for a single, lurking animal. Then a gasp. And another. In almost no time Sophie and Laura had managed to untie one knot, only to find a tighter and far more perplexing one at its center. It astounded Laura to learn that Mark was seeing another woman, whose name also happened to be Laura. The affair had been under way for at least two months. Laura had never liked the way she looked. It had pained her to discover, in middle school, that she did not quite look like anyone else, though it was a pain she hardly registered since it was her conscious wish to be original in everything she did. At twenty-nine, a voyage through her Instagram suggestions would sometimes show her, on other women, her own eyes, nose, or skin tone. Less often her figure and hair. Once isolated, these attributes were difficult for her to picture in concert with one another. She was always flicking the incomplete image of herself away, as if too much dirt had settled here, now there.  This was the regular, self-reproachful state of affairs. But in the days following Sophie’s revelations she had discovered several new ways in which she did not recognize herself. At first—feeling nothing, yet watching a wall of pain approach against which her psyche might splatter—Laura reasoned that it was necessary to discuss the affair with Mark at his and her earliest convenience. She could even indicate over text that their meeting was “urgent” or “urgent haha.” But then she found that she was incapable of sending such a text. She wanted only to run through the streets waving a flag behind her so white and senseless it blocked out the scenery, the sky. She let the weekend go by without contacting him. Then, momentarily caught in the ladderlike lines of a crosswalk, she realized she had forgotten what Mark looked like, and the sound of his voice. It didn’t matter much, in any case. He was more of a cause than a person, some way of life that had mattered and sustained her, but was lost, or about to be. How rapidly the rising generation had imposed itself upon her! Yesterday she had been young. Then she was inside his apartment, standing in his doorway. “It’s eleven o’clock,” he said—his robe on, his feet bare. “All right,” she said. “I can see how a thing like that would happen.” “A thing like what? I’ve been texting you since Tuesday. I was worried.” “And that makes it what day now?” “It’s Wednesday,” said Mark. He was a man of average height with a little round belly and delicate snub nose. The bone structure in his face was all hidden and he smiled easily, which made him look trustworthy. His curly brown hair was thinning on top in the shape of a muddy footprint. None of which Laura could see clearly, because the apartment was dimly lit. Mark had been asleep. “The day after Tuesday.” “It’s almost Thursday.” “But I didn’t come here to enumerate the days of the week, Mark. No. I have serious questions to ask you. Like: where’s the fucking fucking fucking fucking—” Mark stared at her with his mouth open, as if he had been interrupted. But he hadn’t been interrupted. Perhaps, thought Laura, he meant to show her that she’d interrupted years of his life, that all this time he’d been standing around trying without success to yawn just once. “Laura, what’s wrong?” “I know what you know I know! And I feel like a petitioner standing in your doorway like this.” “All right, yeah, come in. Take a seat.” They settled onto the lumpy gray sofa in the living-room portion of his studio apartment. He began by telling her a story. At the hospital in the real world where Mark worked four days a week, the nurses had gone on strike. Hospital administrators had warned the staff against becoming discouraged or speaking with reporters at this challenging moment. They urged professional neutrality. Mark didn’t like to be reminded that sickness and death turned a profit. It made him feel ashamed. So when the reporter reached out, he responded. He was off the record, and the reporter wasn’t intrigued by what he had to say, since she’d heard it all before. But she listened. Her name was Terry McNaught. She told him, also off the record, that if he wanted to “plug” into “the movement,” perhaps in a way that wouldn’t put his new job in jeopardy, he could stop by a potluck her friend was organizing later that week. Terry wouldn’t be there, but she could place him on the email thread. Fifteen days later, he rose early to cook a vegetarian chili that traveled with him to the hospital in a little plastic pail that had once contained pickles. Later, it sat, cold and condensing, in his lap on the train to Bay Ridge. When he pushed open the door he felt transported back a decade, to a time when he and everyone he knew was minimally paid and proudly careless with their possessions. The dirty floor was barely visible beneath the immense clutter of half-broken furniture; utensils and cooking appliances were streaked with saucy refuse; and people were packed together, yelling as if there weren’t just two centimeters of void between them. The air was scented with garlic and nutritional yeast. And Laura was there. “Too confusing,” interrupted Laura. “Refer to her as The Other Laura.” Mark nodded, his expression difficult to make out. The Other Laura was organizing the tenants in her building, which was owned by a management company that shared its listed address with a local Burger King. She also worked as an assistant at a museum during the week and wrote poetry, which she read at bars that used Christmas lights liberally. She was excited to meet a psychiatrist. One of her friends—not at the party—was having a difficult time dealing with a host of phobias that included diseases, disease vectors, and potluck-type situations. Initially this was all they’d discussed. When he followed up with an email to The Other Laura, promising to suggest treatment options for the friend, he honestly hadn’t thought much of it— “This isn’t working,” interrupted Laura again. “Still too confusing. And painful. Refer to her, please, as The Replicant.” “The Replicant? Laura, I don’t really think—” “Tonight you must do exactly as I say!” Laura had begun sweating lightly in the poorly insulated room. It was only after he’d slept with The Replicant for the first time that he began to appreciate the novelty of the thing. Not the physical cheating—although that was new, too!—but caring for another person, and that way, being curious enough to see what would come next. That had never happened, not in seven years. It was clear he hadn’t gone out of his mind or his body, since it was his mind that kept thinking about her, and his body that wanted hers. She wanted him too, and unconditionally. She didn’t mind sharing. In the two months he’d known her, she’d never suggested that what they were doing was wrong or that there was a prescribed set of steps he needed to take. Meanwhile, nothing about his relationship with Laura had changed. They had continued to enjoy each other’s company, and he wasn’t so lonely now when they were apart, which was nearly all the time. In especially happy moments he had even believed Laura wouldn’t be bothered when she inevitably found out; maybe they were just naturally drifting toward an open relationship. She was an artist, after all. They had their own apartments, their own lives, and each other. Now they could invite others in, and be honest about it going forward, as he had not been, for which he was sorry—so very sorry. “Like, maybe this is a step forward for us,” Mark said. “Ironically, the two of you—that is, The Replicant and yourself—would probably get along.” “It’s not irony, Mark. It’s just a falsehood. Would you care to know how I feel about all this?” Mark nodded vigorously. Laura inhaled. The words came to her just as she needed them. “What I feel is that The Replicant has ruined my life. She invaded my home, took photographs of it, ransacked it, then built an entirely new home that looks exactly like my old one before it was destroyed. Pretty soon she’ll be charging admission and inviting our old friends by, plus all these new people, and getting rave write-ups in the local papers, which are read all over the world, with headlines so fawning they summarize the article for you. And now I have to live in this disgusting, destroyed, fallen world. I’m the human element in the pile of detritus nobody wants anymore. And none of it was up to me.” Mark said nothing. He was always too accepting of her feelings. Why couldn’t he, just once, stand in her way, beg her not to leave, or at least tell her she was wrong? “I bet you met her at a bar,” said Laura, finally. “No—what? Should I give you her email? She can confirm what I’ve said. Why would I lie?” “I can think of so many reasons why you would lie. To seem like a good guy, for instance.” “Actually, I did just start doing some mutual-aid work, delivering medicine to neighbors and whatnot. Just, I mean, trying to be an open book about it all and—” “Shut up, Mark.” Laura wiped her palms on her jeans. “Okay Laura, sure, you got it. I’m so sorry again. I—” Then Mark got up and she heard a whoosh like the sound of the tiniest window opening, only it was her boyfriend fumbling with the light switch and suddenly the room was the brightest thing she had ever seen. She had to shade her eyes with her hands and shut them tight. As she reluctantly peeled open her eyes she saw Mark’s face covered in a fine film of tears, and she felt this couldn’t be him—that he, too, had been replaced. She had never seen his face this miserable before. Sympathy, though, was out of the question. She despised The Replicant; that was all. And him, by association, for bringing The Replicant into her life. “Original taste. It means it’s the same everywhere. No matter where you go, you get the delicious beverage you love. And that means what? That the advertising needs to be tar–ge–ted. It means that everywhere you go, you get the same ads you love—or whose quirky humor you approve of, or whose impossible images of success you yearn to live up to—but let’s just say love. It’s shorter. We all have different ideas of what love is, right? Different patterns of seeking, of wanting. But we know it when we taste it.” The following afternoon, Laura’s boss, Mr.Crankel, was conducting a Zoom training for seven new permalancers. Laura and a couple other old-timers were “supervising,” by which was meant “blinking and smiling” and, if they had slept more than five hours, perhaps giving an occasional nod to the camera. Laura had not. “Your job,” continued Mr.Crankel, “is to ferret out those differences, build those psychological profiles, locate their social networks. Brains in a jar chattering nonstop, narrowing their tastes and accumulating more of them all the time. We know this, they know this. We’re not fighting, we’re not tricking. Never trick! It says ‘original taste’ on the can, and that’s all we’re giving them. Just in their own words. Now, I don’t envy your task. I’m a manager—I want to solve every problem by delegating. But you’re imaginative—you’re writers. It’ll be easy for you. All right! Let’s open up this Hollywood Squares convention for questions. Anyone else remember that show Hollywood Squares? Just me?” Bryan T.put a thumbs-up emoji in the chat. “All right! Bryan T.knows what I’m talking about!” Laura had heard Mr.Crankel’s spiel dozens of times before, but didn’t remember despising it this viscerally. She wondered how the Laura she had been, the Laura of a few days ago who had spent thousands of hours tinkering in her workshop of consumer egos like she was God of Selling Soda, had stomached it. It must have given her a sense of well-being, she thought, to presume she could figure people out, entire groups of people, over the course of a project that never took longer than a few weeks to complete. She used to picture subway cars like those she occasionally took to meetings with Mr.Crankel at a café in Midtown that he liked because they always played Sting. The walls of the cars were covered with ads aimed at captivating a particular kind of person, and everyone on the train had the seed of that particular person somewhere inside themselves. It needed only a little water and soil to take root. They were a fascinating swirl of passions and organic materials, these strangers who rode the train through her mind. Twistable souls, sentient fizz. This wasn’t creative work, and Laura never confused it with the pages she kept in her drawer. It was a living. Artists have to make do somehow. But really, thought Laura as she stared at her laptop into twenty hungry eyes, the advertisements had supplanted the words in the drawer. They had become the only words, all anyone ever saw. And she didn’t regret them. In fact, she had come to accept them, and more: she felt powerful in her indifference toward them, which was like a splinter of the divine indifference that offered people everywhere no choice but to submit to their fates. “BryanT., am I running this seminar, or are you? Just kidding! Don’t worry, I’ll only be taking up another forty-five minutes of your time, max. Let’s turn to page sixteen in the employee manual.” Laura had skimmed the manual so many times it felt like something she herself had written, believing every word. She minimized the window in disgust and clicked over to an unsent email. It was intended for The Replicant. Or maybe for nobody; she hadn’t decided yet. The thought of sending it had kept her up all night. In the morning she had cut fifteen hundred peevish words down to an elegant, contemptuous five: “Let’s talk, Laura to Laura.” On the one hand, she didn’t want to learn a single additional fact about The Replicant, and on the other, there was no denying her sudden, all-consuming presence in Laura’s mind. Not to mention the unraveling of her seven-year relationship, although she found it easy not to think of Mark. She was already in the habit. She imagined the conversation she’d had with Sophie playing out for all eternity, the life she thought she was leading being continually, casually mistaken for another’s. Mark bragging about “Laura’s” accomplishments, saying things are going really well with Laura and I’ve never been happier. And his most tactless friend, Justin, the volelike fellow with the baseball-cap addiction, would ask, Whatever happened to that other Laura? Just another Laura. Was this her destiny? The fantasies felt nauseatingly real. They were violating, unacceptable, and all the more so because they did not explain the terror that occasioned them. Her face on her computer screen, caught in the gaze of her webcam, was mercifully small, its eyes frozen in desperate concentration. Scanning the pages of an employee manual for dear life, one might assume. She was hitting send. It was done. But the unacceptable feeling only intensified. She recalled the existence of Pepsi, how bad it tasted when compared with the real thing. A few days later, Laura awoke to the sound of her cell phone ringing. She could see on her phone screen that it was six in the morning. Still dark out. She’d been asleep for only a couple of hours and yet felt entirely ready to get up, continue on to the next thing. These days she wasn’t living her life so much as keeping vigil over it. She hardly rested. Ambient dread had raised her defenses against loneliness, sleep, memory, longing—only fixations penetrated, whatever kept her alert and moving. It was the director calling. “Hello? Laura?” He sounded positively thrilled, as out of step with the hour as she was. “Good morning!” “I was going to leave you a message. What an unexpected pleasure it is to hear your voice! We’re surfing on the same wave, you know? I was just going over the final edit of our little film.” “Ah, the little film. Tell me.” “It’s beautiful, Laura. Just ten minutes long, but your dialogue is so radical, so real. When we pan to the pattern of the tablecloth and the wineglasses moving swiftly over it as the narrator gives five dictionary definitions of ego death? That destroyed my mind.” “Pierre, merci beaucoup. I’m touched.” She was sitting on an email from The Replicant, who had responded within an hour of Laura’s reaching out. This haste seemed somehow shameless. “A new idea came to me in the middle of the night. It is my greatest passion and I am quite eager to share it with you, Laura. Can you come over sometime?” “How about now?” said Laura. She felt that were she to linger in bed a moment longer she might wind up staying there all day, glued to a hypnotic sense of disbelief in her own life.  The director lived in a narrow L-shaped apartment in the Village with floor-to-ceiling mirrors on three walls. No windows in the living room, very clean, with black leather furniture and ficus plants that were louche and aquatic beneath soft sprays of track lighting. On the walls—a mix of exposed brick and stucco—hung what appeared to be large, blurry photographs of coiled galaxies, although they might have been platters of recreational drugs served up on vinyl; there was no way to know. The atmosphere was charming, crass, and rather technical. Pierre greeted Laura wearing black pants and a loosely draped button-down printed with Le Monde headlines. “Please keep your shoes on,” he said. “Unless it is your preference to take them off. For my part, it is my preference to sweep.” She gave him her coat to hang in a closet. He returned carrying what looked to be a pair of black mourning veils. “If you’d like,” he said, “we could wear these veils. It is actually something very cheap you can buy at any mall. You put them on like headbands. They are part of my experiments with face blindness.” Laura thought, Could I sue him for this? They sat in the breakfast nook, she on the leather love seat, he on a leather folding chair. Laura found herself wondering what sort of sporting event one would bring such a chair to. Open-air competitive body piercing, perhaps. She gazed into the mirror behind the director and could hardly make out the slopes and planes of her countenance beneath the black web of cheap netting. For the first time in years she did not immediately avert her gaze. The reflection satisfied her. On the other side of the window, the sky was turning a violent red. “Please excuse my sloppy shirt and bag eyes. I have already been up for hours arguing with my colleagues, friends, and cousins. The Parisians awake while we remain sleeping, and I like to get right to it.” “What do you argue about?” asked Laura, hoping not to find out. “It’s not what that matters, but why. I think we are too similar, too familiar. Same field, same age, same family. I’m like everyone else in my generation. We work hard, nurture our delusions, we are aesthetes, we want to be excellent, but we can’t come together. And I am the same! I don’t want to join in with them. Just like them, I’d rather compare myself to something outside—to the millennials, for instance, who entrance and repulse me. Not you, Laura, I’m speaking broadly. I think that what I am trying to say is something like this: I am obsessed with alienating myself from people!” “Is that why you make movies?” “For me, film goes both ways. I devise my vision of alienation, and it brings me into contact with other people, many of whom I enjoy very much.” “Ah, well, in that case: What was the idea you wanted to talk about?” “What I propose is a feature film based on the myth of Baucis and Philemon. Has this ever been done? I think that possibly, unbelievably, it has not! And now, what Godard did for the Odyssey, what Sciamma did for Eurydice, I want to do for these two old people who did not recognize the gods when they showed up at their door, but welcomed them in anyway. I want to uncover new dimensions, place the story in a new context, create new psychologies. Of course, we all know what happens to Baucis and Philemon, and the lesson we’re supposed to learn, every schoolchild knows.” “They, like, burn to death, right? In a fire?” “Laura, Laura—no. All their neighbors die in a flood devised by the gods who are disappointed in them and, frankly, a bit insecure. But Baucis and Philemon get turned into trees. Why? Actually, that’s my first agenda item.” The director retrieved a miniature notepad from his shirt pocket and began turning the pages with his right pinky. “What is?” “I have it here written down: item one. discuss with laura: why trees?” Laura had pulled up Ovid’s Metamorphoses on her phone, finding that the veil obscured her vision less when she stared up close at an object that generated its own light. “It says here,” she said, “paraphrasing—that Baucis and Philemon were a poor, elderly couple, and yet when the gods Jupiter and Mercury showed up at their door disguised as beggars, they lavished them with all the hospitality they could muster. The gods revealed themselves to the couple and led them to a hill, where they watched their neighbors, who had all shut their doors against the strangers, drown. Baucis and Philemon were rewarded with a temple in place of their former modest dwelling. It says that the gods let them ask for anything they wanted and what they wanted was to tend to the temple and to die at the same hour. So when death eventually came for them, the gods decided—um, for some reason—to turn them into trees. A linden and an oak. Sounds like a bargain for the gods.” “When you command such inordinate power, you get everything at a bargain. Isn’t that the way of the world? Whereas the people of the country paid dearly for their moment of selfishness. The gods went disguised as strangers, as supplicants, yes, but then they went on a murderous rampage!” “I’d like to be a tree. Plenty of sunlight, wind on my face,” mused Laura as she adjusted her veil. “No bank account, no more struggling along.” “Nihilism. That’s one option! I think, though, that you don’t become a tree because you’re tired of living.” “No?” she said, disappointed. “Laura,” he said, with a hint of concern, “I feel certain that people do not become trees by waiting around to become trees. But why trees in the first place? I don’t have the answer.” Laura shrugged, frustrated, yet she maintained the confidence of one who cannot be seen sweating lightly from the forehead. “Maybe a warning,” she said after a while. “Meaning?” “For the Romans. So that whenever they leave their—erm—temples, or wherever they lived—” “Houses, Laura, my god.” “Whenever they leave their houses and see trees they’ll be reminded of the story, its lesson.” “Which is?” “To welcome the stranger, right? Or else obliterate country, kin, and yourself.” “Okay, interesting. That is not what I was thinking at all. My inclinations were far more agricultural. Now I am seeing the story in a whole new light! So what do you say? Do you want to work with me on this? It will take six months to a year to fundraise and meanwhile we can continue these discussions on a regular basis. All of them generously compensated by me, of course.” This time Laura did not hesitate. “For sure. I can see myself devoting a lot of energy to this.” Over the following weeks, several of Laura and Mark’s mutual friends began to realize something was up. And who or what had tipped them off? Possibly it was Laura, operating on a minimum of sleep and crossing one bridge too many to attend several casual weekend gatherings in a state of mean intoxication, telling anyone who would listen that there was someone running around the city with her exact same life. If it wasn’t Laura who tipped them off (which it totally was, and loudly), then Mark strolling into the party with a small white-haired woman on his arm did. Either way, such bold-faced confirmation left no room for doubt, which was somehow also the exact amount of room required to encourage endless speculation among this information-saturated and intimacy-starved social set. Laura thought at first that The Replicant didn’t look her age, which Mark had told her in a polite and infuriatingly long email she did not respond to was twenty-five. At that moment, drinking in the face and body of this woman with burning eyes, Laura chastised herself for failing to stalk her on the internet, find out everything about her, and build one of those psychological profiles she’d once prided herself on. It hadn’t occurred to her to do so. She’d trapped her firmly within the confines of a brief email correspondence. The Replicant had represented to her a blank, and—since she equated youth with beauty and beauty with her own perceived lack of it—a taunting, youthful blank. But this woman wasn’t particularly beautiful; the hue of her hair wasn’t indicative of youth—it gave her an ageless, elvish quality. And she was unguarded, neat, like a gleaming set of tools that might repair, adjust, and take the measure of you. Mark’s eyes teemed with feelings of tenderness that fled the moment he caught sight of Laura. She felt for the arm of a couch that wasn’t there and stumbled a little. He made no move to assist her—not because he didn’t want to; he couldn’t. After little more than two weeks of his copious messages and her silence, he was stunned to discover that he was already unlearning her, that he couldn’t intuit in a given moment what she wanted from him. That vivid sense of service had been his reason for staying. He had been able to give her what she wanted without knowing where the desires came from or how he recognized them. Laura had always said that wanting was better than needing, because it was a product of the imagination and the driver of all ingenuity, artistic or otherwise. But why did that make it superior to needing? Mark wanted to know. The mind inventing things to want, chasing them, letting them become elusive, like a kitten playing with a piece of string—this was all familiar to him; in fact, it was shop talk. It seemed harmless enough on the surface. Yet a life guided by this precept flashed by in moments of critical distraction and disintegration. The rind, the integument, but never the soft, vital substance they protected. He needed things he had not even begun to want. Laura had steadied her body but not her vision, which seemed to swing just above her head like a chandelier. “Oh no,” she said. “I’m way drunk for what’s happening here.” “We can go,” said Mark. “There was a miscommunication. I couldn’t get in touch with you. I was worried but I understood why you wouldn’t—I understand—” “Cease and desist your ‘understand.’ I am the person who’s been left, so I am the person who understands! You should understand less!” “I have a feeling I’m about to.” “You are right! As right as rain when it rains for years—no, days—and I just want to say that I’m good good good. Don’t worry, just cause you see me, and I’m falling down, don’t worry, cause I’m allll about trees now. I’ve been reading about the gods. That’s right—the gods. They’re gonna come down from heaven and be quite disappointed in you, Mark. The gods will be like, What a fucking joke Mark is, laughing at you in your temple where my house used to be. What I’m saying is I got a new job, it’s great, I’m fine, and—hmm—I need to speak with your representative.” “Laura, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” The other partygoers had begun to give the quarrelers a wide berth, as if to grant respect and privacy in this difficult time—although really, what they created with their lowered voices and oblique stances was a stage. “I need to speak with your Replicant.” “Please don’t call her that. It’s not her name. She won’t respond to it.” “Hi,” said The Replicant, extending an arm and a hand toward Laura. “It’s so good to meet you!” “What,” said Laura. “You’re kidding.” “No, really, I think we should talk like you suggested! Sorry if I wasn’t clear about that in my email.” “You were clear!” “There’s no time limit on this. If you want to get to know me, if you’re curious, you know where to find me.” Laura felt The Replicant’s words being drilled into her skull. “Because of you I make no sense!” Here Justin, volelike, butted in with his trademark forced laughter. “Kinda think it’s the whiskey, Laura.” “I’m preaching the gospel of existentialism, Justin. I’m being uprooted, that-a-one over there is living in my temple. It’s all in the Bible.” “What’s all this about the temple?” asked Mark. “And the—the trees, was it?” “Sorry, it’s in the Meadowmorphoses, is what I meant to say,” said Laura. “My bad. Does anyone know—okay—does anyone know whether Ovid had a last name? Or was Ovid his last name?” “I think it was just Ovid,” said Mark’s white-haired date. “The way you’re just The Replicant,” shot back Laura. “No, my name is Laura.” “And my name is Laura.” “And your name is Laura. It’s a popular name.” “And Mark’s a popular guy,” said Laura, aiming once again to pierce the wobbling night with a clear blow against her alarmingly sober enemy. “Not really.” “No, you’re right about that,” said Laura, growing contemplative. “He doesn’t have the people skills. But then, I never did either. Clearly. I need to be sleeping in a bed now. Where can I find you when I’m conscious again?” “Hmm?” “You said—Laura, you said, ‘You know where to find me.’” “I do administrative work at the natural history museum Sunday through Thursday. Just drop by, I can pretty much always take a break. Come tomorrow. I literally have nothing going on.” “You work at the natural history museum?” said Laura, as if every word were a hurdle she was taking her sweet time stepping over. “The American Museum of Natural History?” No more than sixteen hours later, Laura found herself staring up at the massive stone steps of the museum. She’d taken a cab home, slept, absorbed five alcoholic beverages into the fabric of her being, eaten a soft pretzel, and drunk a Snapple purchased from a street vendor. Laura called the woman (she was trying to be charitable and phase out addressing her as The Replicant), who was only too free, but was around the corner at the planetarium. “It’s a lot brighter over here,” the woman advised cheerfully. Much of the building was made of glass and the sun poured through it. “Good for the days that arrive after long nights.” Sure, thought Laura, if you want your head to explode. They met along the perimeter of the Big Bang exhibit. A single-file line of visitors was making its way through it at an excruciating pace. Billions of years flew by with each step, and they didn’t want to miss anything. “I see you don’t work in the sharks department,” said Laura. “Too bad.” “Pardon?” “There were all these pamphlets and signs in the main lobby for the museum’s special exhibit on sharks. Their slogan was ‘to be great is to be misunderstood.’ Pretty compelling, given the subject matter.” “Oh yeah, you write ad copy, don’t you?” “I do. It’s not my true calling to stand back and admire the handiwork of museum signage, but it’s a living. I swim with the sharks.” The woman took a step toward Laura, who was squinting into the sun. “I’m more interested in your kind, to be honest.” They went through an unmarked door into a looping administrative corridor that contained nothing but filing cabinets and vending machines. Laura soberly examined this woman whose existence had so rudely ripped her from slumber for many a night. As they continued their small talk, Laura noticed that the woman had a way with people that was frank and intuitive. It was a bedside manner for the wide awake, or whoever had need of it. This woman was nothing like Laura. Nonetheless, Laura was on guard for the essential thing they surely must share, whatever it was that compelled the woman to follow in her footsteps, to covet and then co-opt her life. “I don’t want to give up Mark,” blurted Laura, suddenly, but not passionately. “I don’t want you to, Laura. I’ve never wanted that.” The woman was very cool, but not inert. This seemed to be the conversation she most wished to have. “I want you to give him up, though.” “I see. It causes you pain that I’m—” “It doesn’t cause me pain,” interrupted Laura. “All right. Well. I’m not giving him up,” said the woman. “But I was there first!” “You weren’t first. We’re adults. It’s too late for that. But okay, by your logic, the holy sequence of events, maybe I’m second. Or maybe you are. Maybe time is running backward!” the woman proclaimed with an insolent flourish. Laura thought spending too much time around the Big Bang exhibit was detrimental to a hardening twenty-five-year-old brain. “You’d have to be nuts to think that.” “Let’s just refrain from talking about the hard knocks of life and who has a right to love whom as if we’re all standing in one long cosmic line, is all I’m saying.” “Fine, have it your way. But I do love Mark.” “Okay! So talk to Mark about Mark. He says you don’t call and he’s worried about you. He’s worried about you going through life without the shearling slippers you left at his place and, frankly, he’s worried about you wandering the streets in no shoes at all. Laura, I don’t know you well, but sometimes it’s as if I’m dating your mother.” “I wear shoes! Tell him I wear shoes, the kind that can stand up to city streets and snow.” “Tell him yourself!” “Okay,” said Laura, slumping down into one of the chairs. “Okay.” The woman had been seated for some time. “I read a poem of yours this afternoon,” said Laura. “I went online and looked you up.” “Which one?” “It was called ‘Human Head in Fishbowl.’” “What did you think?” “The title was misleading. I also heard you do some activism? In your apartment?” “On Earth we call it ‘tenant organizing.’” “Well, a conference room in the planetarium feels like neutral ground.” “Between what and what?” “Between Earth and, you know,” Laura gestured widely with her hands, “the big mystery of it all. The omega. The Bang. The infinite something above and below our heads that’s taking forever to curl up into nothingness.” “And here I thought you were just mocking me.” “Well. I sort of was. Sorry.” It dawned on Laura that she really was sorry. She was growing fond of this woman. Her persistence, her consoling streak, her argumentative streak. Perhaps one day, months or years from now, the woman’s existence would cease to torment her. “Actually,” Laura found herself saying, “I think I admire what you do. In theory, at least. I’d like to do something like that myself someday.” Laura wasn’t sure if she meant it, but it seemed to give the woman a certain license. She spoke earnestly to Laura about her life for a long time. Her despondency, her credulities, her joys. There was no wonderful slogan, perfectly articulated platform, or sense of righteousness held on to firmly enough that would bring about the world she wanted. But here was this world and, somehow, she was trying to catch its eye, to hold its gaze a little longer each time. Belief, she’d decided, was what she was after, to believe in as much of the world as she could. Mark’s trusting smile, the senselessness of fate, the drift of the stars, and the price of love. Six months passed, then a year. The director had raised the necessary funds and was several weeks into a new health regime that prohibited all exercise yet demanded that he remain standing for as much of the day as possible. This required incredible amounts of cold coffee. He was walking, talking stimulant soup, and looked better than ever. “The secret is my own blood,” he liked to blurt out. “These days it mostly pools in my legs and feet, but nobody can tell!” The first day of filming was the high point of this creative venture, which, while not exactly arduous, had, up until then, taken many confounding turns. Laura, never wavering in her commitment to follow the director through his labyrinthine process, still privately considered a few of his sharp turns to have been inadvisable. At the top of her list were the two months they had wasted trying to adapt Baucis and Philemon into a movie musical. There was to be a magnificent number with the townspeople in matching spandex outfits bitchily slamming their doors in unison to an ever-swelling melody. The angle they’d settled on was much more achievable in terms of budget and scale, and a better match for Laura’s own writerly sensibility. It would be a modern interpretation, no music. Baucis and Philemon are living off Social Security in an illegal basement apartment in Sunnyside, Queens. Philemon was laid off six months ago from the local paper where he had worked for fifty years as a city hall reporter, during which time Baucis cultivated herself as an eccentric—first fortune-telling, then designing wearable art, then straight-up hoarding. There isn’t a takeout box or magazine that passes through her doorway that she doesn’t try to repurpose as a belt or a hat. The ceiling leaks. The rent is impossible to scrape together, but so are thoughts of leaving. They’re content with each other and at the same time unutterably lonely, since nobody, not even the delivery workers, not even the women with faces like fresh produce who canvass for the city comptroller, can bear to cross their threshold. Baucis is hard at work crafting a small, companionable dog out of a week’s worth of amNewYorks when two miserable-looking individuals dressed in togas knock on the door and ask if they can come in for a bit of a lie-down. So far, these two troublesome and filthy strangers haven’t found any takers, but Baucis and Philemon welcome them in, no questions asked. Later, after the rest of the city’s inhabitants have been wiped out by a colossal storm, Baucis and Philemon issue their requests to the gods and are granted, first, a floor-through loft in Chinatown. Their lives become incredibly chic! But there’s no one left in the city for them to share their good fortune with. Occasionally the gods stop by, blast some ABBA, go on elysian benders that leave no residue of human suffering, and complain about their terrible kids, who are going to live forever. In the film’s final scene, Baucis and Philemon undergo their ultimate transformation. Philemon is reading an Alberto Moravia novel while Baucis pours them two bowls of Grape-Nuts—courtesy of the gods—for breakfast. She tries shuffling to the fridge for dairy-free milk and almost falls over. Her feet are rooted to the ground. Philemon, his back to her, is frantically knocking over tables and chairs as his legs turn to wood. The change takes hold rather slowly, allowing time for physical comedy and dialogue. “I am a pious woman,” wails Baucis. “I always try to have faith. But oh, that it has come to this! To see every neighbor washed away, and have nobody to invite over to our gorgeous apartment—and then, on top of that, to be turned into trees! Philemon! You’re eerily quiet—are you even listening? Don’t you have anything to say?” “I’m shrugging,” says Philemon. “And if a tree should shrug in the forest?” “What forest? We’re downtown.” “I wish I could see your face.” “Eh, I’m glad you can’t. It would be too much for me just now.” “But there is no later. Oh, Philemon! Just answer me this. Why is this happening to us?” “We asked to die at the same time. In retrospect, I might have amended that request, but the gods probably thought they were giving us a real treat. They’re a lot older than us, you know. I wouldn’t put it past them to have outmoded concepts about what people are into these days.” It went on like that for a while, with sulky French camerawork and Borscht Belt delivery. The director had rehired that same young woman, Sophie, to handle the coffee and lunch orders. She was running every which way, blowing on his coffee and wielding a clipboard. Laura respected her near-athletic ability to feign having a lot on her plate at any given moment. After work, she and Sophie went to a nearby dive bar. It was mobbed with Christmas lights; Laura wondered how often they held poetry readings. The laminated menu taped to the wall was stocked with the usual cheap alcoholic concoctions, plus the occasional witticism and curiosity. They each got a Helen’s Face. It was pineapple something. Sophie hadn’t changed much, or at least the first impression she’d made had yet to dissipate. The red hair and deadpan delivery. Her presence here in this bar, a facsimile of every bar Laura had frequented in her twenties, served as a portal back to a period Laura could remember but no longer touch; the scenery was familiarly arranged, but the dreams, sensations, and illusions had vanished. She no longer looked at this woman and imagined what she herself had been and might become. Instead, Laura saw a woman, a relative stranger, whose flagrant presumptions had unwittingly changed the course of her own life, or perhaps only hastened that change. And she saw that whatever she, Laura, would become next was anyone’s guess. For now, she was tired. Going weeks without talking to anyone who wasn’t her boss, returning from marathon brainstorming sessions to the modest apartment that never accommodated visitors, and collapsing at the end of the day from the work she threw herself into with frantic diligence and tempered bitterness. She’d taken the works in progress out of her desk and placed them on the floor of her closet to be trampled on by empty shoes. It was obvious to her now that someone else had written them. Meanwhile, she was working more hours than ever for the ad agency and the director. Sophie grimaced at the sweetness of the drink, then sucked it all down. “Something else next, yes?” The conversation felt carefree despite the lack of intimacy between them—like a cold reading of a script that sends the actors into fits of giggles. Laura even managed, without much effort, to ask Sophie if she’d seen Mark and his girlfriend around. “Other Laura?” said Sophie, kindly. “They’re not really in my crowd, more adjacent to it. Yes, I saw them, but only once.” “I haven’t seen him in almost a year. Either of them.” “Does that mean you met her?” “Once or twice. When I first found out. Where did you see them? How did they seem?” “Like two assholes in love. We were in the woods, so that was probably enhancing the effect. People suffering extreme emotional states can so easily fly under the radar in this city, don’t you find?” “I’m living proof of it! Perhaps I should pour myself out into a glen someday. But how did you come to discover them in the woods?” “A retreat of sorts. It was organized by this collective I’m a part of and so are they. I hadn’t realized Mark joined until I saw him there. The group is decentralized, totally offline. I’m sure there are more of us in this city than anywhere else, but the larger East Coast meetings happen upstate. It’s funny—you show up and half the attendees are brushing phantom ticks off their fitted tees and the other half come prepared not merely to pass the night in the great outdoors but for Armageddon itself. Everyone wears black, regardless.” Laura laughed, carried away by the strangeness of this world Sophie was building, picturing her ex-boyfriend, who’d once read The Atlantic with genuine concern, sitting in a mud patch plotting the revolution. “Somehow I can’t imagine you in that situation,” she said. “What, in a fitted tee?” “Huddled around a campfire planning subversive pipeline demolitions.” “Oh no—it’s nothing like that! We don’t discuss major actions at chapter meetings. The retreats are more like group therapy.” Sophie pushed her four inches of ice to the corner of the table. “And now you’re awfully quiet. May I ask what you’re thinking?” “I’m thinking,” said Laura, majorly tipsy, “I’m thinking it would be easy for me to despise your Luddite, hippie ways—” Sophie cut in: “We’re not hippies. That’s an important distinction and I must insist upon it. That would be like calling Lou Reed a hippie.” “My mistake, my mistake. You’re in the In Dreams Begin Responsibilities crowd—I get it. And on the one hand, it is easy for me to dismiss you. But on the other—and I mean this—it all sounds far too clandestine and exciting for you to be telling me about it.” “Why is that?” “Because my life is boring. It’s sad. I’m closed up tight, in the extreme.” “Is that true?” “Yeah, it is. What do the Marxists have to say about boredom and sadness?” “Well, for starters, they agree on very little. In an ideal world, the one we’re all trying to bring about, probably none of us would have ever met one another in the first place. Who needs the headache?” “I think I may be living in that world,” said Laura. “Hence the boredom.” “Somehow I think we’re living in the same world,” said Sophie. “Hence the sadness.” Suddenly Sophie dropped her pensive expression. “I just remembered I have something incredible to tell you!” “What is it?” “Baucis and Philemon are hooking up!” “What?” exclaimed Laura, then, bashful yet with boundless hope, added, “Is it—is it because they’re married?” “No. Remember they introduced themselves to each other on set today? I dashed into the supply closet earlier—during that long break when Pierre announced he was going out to eat a donut ‘experimentally’—I was searching for coffee lids, and it turned out to be a pretty weird closet. It branched into a back stairwell, and I could hear moans coming from around the corner. Then whispering, and what I can only describe as rustling. They’d removed their arm branches and were embracing freely, hands-down-pants and everything. But they still had their enormous head canopies on, which forced them to get creative with the angles. In full costume and makeup. It was beautiful! To see them twisting around each other, sighing heavily, laughing. You could tell they thought it was hilarious, even through all that sexual energy. It was like the only living trees in the world had found each other. It was fate!” These last words stayed with Laura long after she and the other patrons had vanished one by one and the bar had closed for the evening. On the train home: “It was fate!” Putting away the late-night salsa and chips: “Fate!” Alone in bed, she felt a long way from anyone else’s romance, anyone’s fate. Sleep eluded her. Recently, she’d taken to prefacing stories about her recent past with “when I was young,” in preparation for turning thirty-one. It was a cruelty to herself, she knew that. But it was so hard to answer any of her own questions, and sometimes it felt better to believe the best of life was over, a belief no story about lusty seventy-year-olds licking green dye off each other’s bodies could dislodge. Why find someone? Why lose them? Why does this pain last so long? Why this embrace and not that one? Why go on? Why fall in love with the world? Or just one person? Why die? Why change? The apartment felt dreadfully small. From her bed, she could see nearly all of it without turning her head. On her desk were the supplies laid out for her next day of work. Behind the closet door lay her old ambitions, entombed. In the kitchen a modest window framed an assembly of stars anyone could see and invent stories about, beginning with their names. is a freelance writer.

        "story": "“Paul says I’m just dicknotized.” Paul is Lily’s gay best friend and closest romantic confidant. Grating portmanteaus are a crucial part of their relationship. “Dickmatized?” I pronounce the word wrong so she knows I hate it. “That’s what he says.” I could return the compliment, tell her I’m clitnotized (pussified?), but I don’t have much going for me besides sex. She’s better-looking and more successful than I am. “Why did he say that?” “Because I am.” “No, I mean why were you talking about it?” “I’m spending all my time with you instead of enjoying my freedom.” Lily feels that she hasn’t slept with enough people. She likes to say she’s jealous of me. I like to say I’m jealous of her, that quality is more important than quantity. I don’t actually say, “Quality is more important than quantity,” but that’s the logic. She’s had “lovers,” after all. She uses the word nonchalantly, which I find both hilarious and intimidating. And she’s slept almost entirely with people she still knows, men and some women in her old Parisian ambit, whereas I’ve slept almost entirely with strangers no one knows. My affairs will be lost to history, but she’s built a legacy. She didn’t move to New York to escape it. She moved to forget something else. At the bar, Lily switches her mother’s ring to her left hand and we tell strangers we’re married. This is obnoxious of us. An NYU student says she loves our accents even though I’m not doing one. After the bar, we go to another bar, then to an afters where we lose track of each other on purpose. I end up on a couch with an energetic German named Juliette whom I’ve impressed with Lily’s opinions about Berlin. Juliette’s hair is wavy and fine. It keeps slipping into our mouths. When she finally pauses to tie it back, Lily materializes, plopping her head into my lap. Juliette asks me if I have WhatsApp. I say my phone is dead, which is not true, and she shrugs like it’s my loss. A large man takes her place on the couch, which is really a love seat. His stomach spills onto my knee; it doesn’t quite touch Lily’s head. She is fast asleep, legato respiration and faint smile. This has happened before—she can sleep anywhere. When I leave the next day for my parents’ house in the suburbs, Lily cries. We haven’t spent a night apart since we met. It’s been three weeks. She laughs. My parents are turning my bedroom into a guest room. Painting it takes me three days on account of some rain. The room looks so much better, I tell my mom, that it makes me want to move back in. She coughs down her asparagus—am I doing okay? A reasonable question given my history, but it annoys me all the same. I was obviously joking. I say, “It’s fine to tell your adult son you don’t want him to move in with you.” “I know it’s fine. It seems like something that doesn’t need to be said.” “So I can’t move back in?” “Honey, tell me what’s wrong. Of course you can.” “Jesus Christ.” We insult each other with therapy language until we’re tired enough to make peace. My dad gets home. Standing behind my mom’s chair, he puts his hands on her shoulders. She closes her eyes and sighs: content with him, me, the world. All this because we fought and made up. My phone rings the next morning at seven o’clock. “How are you?” Lily is wasted. “I’m good.” I leave a space she doesn’t fill. “Not as good as you. Are you out?” “He’s asleep, but I couldn’t and wanted to talk to you.” Blood in my ears. “Hi.” “All I get is hi?” Either she’s playing dumb or she’s too drunk to hear that my voice has run cold. “I’m glad you had a fun night.” “When can I see you?” At dinner, I gather the details of her hookup as though it’s just something to talk about. She met him at the party where I declined to get Juliette’s number because I didn’t know Lily and I were hedging our bets. French trust funder who owns a restaurant in Nolita. Cute place. They got absolutely shit-faced. “‘Don’t worry,’ he said, ‘I’ll fuck you in the morning.’” Lily rolls her eyes. “So French. He was still asleep when I left.” “Oh?” “It wasn’t a total waste. The food was excellent.” “Did you use him for a free meal?” “No, I wanted to sleep with him.” She’s wondering if she should be offended. “I was just teasing.” “Your mother was just teasing.” Lily is alluding to my compulsive use of the comeback “your mother,” which would have been an annoying but innocent bit of juvenilia the first few times I said it if Lily’s mother hadn’t been dead; if she hadn’t died suddenly and recently; if her death weren’t the defining tragedy of Lily’s life. My “your mother” tick, its idiot callousness, is our first running joke. Lily says the pain fades when she’s with me and I don’t think she’s lying. We haven’t been ourselves. This is how bad I am, we always seem to be saying. Tell me how bad you are. Lily has cheated on all her boyfriends. I didn’t have to coax the details out of her because confessions felt like complicities, but now, after this French guy and his restaurant, they feel like something else. I know I’m not supposed to hold her past against her; I heard this advice on a call-in radio show about sex and relationships when I was a teenager and it stuck with me, gathering dust. But it’s not true. You use everything. For cheating on Psycho, Lily says she feels no remorse. He hit her. Roland was a good boyfriend, and she regrets cheating on him, but explains the affair away as a means of getting out of a relationship that needed to end. There are others in the distant past, and a more recent, different kind of infidelity: a week before she moved to New York, Lily hooked up with a man her cousin loves unrequitedly, an episode for which she professes deep guilt but chalks up to drugs, grief, and projection. The history itself doesn’t bother me. Everyone with an appetite has history, and I want appetite. It’s the pat explanations she absolves herself with. They seem evidence of an all’s-fair fatalism that will eat me alive unless I armor myself by fucking someone else as soon as possible. It’s the only viable solution. I have no right to be angry with her since we’re liberated people having fun. I am not aware of time. At some point we get coke and talk a lot, or I talk a lot. I don’t fuck her. She looks at the clock and says she needs to shower for work. On the weekends, she goes into Manhattan to translate documents for a law firm in Midtown. I tell her she should come back here afterward. I give her my key and show her how to jiggle the front lock in case I’m sleeping. I doubt I will be. I’ve got a plan now. Men in Santa Claus costumes and women dressed as elves are already converging on lower Manhattan to puke into gutters and pee between cars. SantaCon began as a piece of performance art: false-bearded altruists handing out gifts on the street. Now it’s an all-day pub crawl. The transformation improved it as art, made it an affront to polite society that recalls the dipsomaniacal mall Santas of yore, but you’re supposed to hate it because, in addition to being a loud mess, it attracts a lame crowd. I don’t hate it. I can have fun anywhere. I’m standing in an Irish bar, talking to a small woman with enormous cleavage and plastic elf ears, close to making something happen with her, when the bouncer accuses me of having drunk multiple abandoned drinks. I deny the charge. He’s a squat, bristling man with beautiful pale eyes. When he reaches for me, I raise my hands and leave. Outside, a disconsolate Santa presses his forehead against the building next door. He’s looking down at his feet, saying numbers. I can’t tell if there’s a pattern, if a pattern would make him more sane or less. He’s alone and his situation is dire and I am cutting him a wide berth on my way to the crowded-looking bar at the corner when Lily texts me. She finished her work. Should she still come over? It’s one in the afternoon. Time flown. I step aside for a contingent of Santas walking three abreast. One of them says, “My dad is highly depressed.” Another responds, “That sucks dick.” I gave up on sleep and went into Manhattan to get lunch with an old friend who’s in town Want to join us? \nI’m exhausted. I’ll just go home. I have your key though... The self- and Lily-respecting thing to do would be to head home, but I feel on the precipice of great achievement. I’m cresting a significant wave. The horizon is beginning to look like land. That buxom elf put wind in my sails, so to speak, and now this other, prettier woman is bumming a cigarette off me. Angry-thin with bushy eyebrows... I have to have her. No polite way to put it. I say maybe I’ll see her inside. She says, “Good.” I turn away to finish texting. Nooo, I want to see you Why don’t you go pass out at my place? \nI feel weird going there by myself. Roommates are gone till Monday, remember. There’s no chance of awkwardness. Please? \nOkay :) Margot’s face is distinguished by a crescent of freckles across her upper cheeks and nose that would be too precious without the imposing eyebrows. She’s dressed like a cool person, but her friends are business casual. Xavier, a handsome man with olive skin, and Andrew, a blond guy with a square head, purchased their Santa hats from a street vendor. They were up all night and joined the festivities as a joke. “Same,” I say. “Minus the hat.” Margot touches my head. “SantaCon is so trashy. But why?” Xavier scans the room so our eyes follow, then removes his hat. “What is the specific trashiness of SantaCon?” The bar is less crowded than it looked from down the street. Almost everyone is sitting at a table. “Why is it trashy?” Andrew shrugs. “The bridge-and-tunnel element.” “They’re not specific,” Xavier says. “Drunk Santas dry-humping and fighting are specific. The ruining of Christmas for children.” He has the faintest hint of an English accent. I want to call it transatlantic, but he doesn’t sound like an old-timey movie star. “I never believed in Santa Claus,” Andrew says. “No one believes in Santa Claus,” Margot says. She has a deep laugh. “He’s a game of make-believe that children play with adults.” “Some kids really believe in him,” I say, because some kids must. “Don’t psychologists have a term for that?” Xavier addresses the question to Margot. “‘Half-belief,’ something like that?” “‘Half-belief’...” Margot seems to be recalling the term from a distant class. “No, dude.” She grins. “No one calls anything that.” They are high school friends, boarding school, all three of them. Margot teaches art at a private school on the Upper East Side and Xavier and Andrew work for banks or maybe one of them works at a hedge fund. When it comes time for me to buy a round, I explain that I lost my wallet, which sets off an elaborate eye-contact conversation between Xavier and Margot. He isn’t buying my story. She wants him to chill. They have history and I’m ruining his chance to cash in on it. “I always lose things,” says blond Andrew of the square head without looking up from the whiskey he’s contemplating. He has both hands around the glass like it’s a large mug. The last drink pushed him past having fun. He didn’t mean to save me, was just making sure his voice still worked, but I’m grateful all the same. Andrew doesn’t make it to Margot’s apartment, a one-bedroom on Jane Street for which she makes several apologies. Xavier tells her she needs to “level up.” He’s been leaning hard on the money stuff. I hate his vocabulary and his boarding school bloodhound nose for insecurity. I don’t care that I don’t have money, but I assume Margot requires some minimum of pedigree and I don’t want to squander my night testing the assumption. “I can’t afford your building on an art teacher’s salary,” Margot says, as though she affords this place on it. Xavier wants his father to buy this film studio in Taipei. It’s just what the pater’s portfolio needs, but the pater isn’t sure. I keep quiet and nurse my vodka. The rich love to talk about money, but they know it’s in poor taste. When I empty what remains of last night’s bag onto Margot’s laptop, Xavier turns to me. “Do you like movies, Neil?” “I hate them.” I hand him the cocaine laptop. He looks drunk now. “I don’t suppose you have a bill,” he says. “I bet you do.” I wink at him and he smiles, genuinely charmed. Mining subtext is the highest form of conversation for some people. My phone buzzes against my leg. A text from Lily: “Where are you?” I put my phone back in my pocket. “Did you see Slapforest?” Xavier asks me, powder rimming one nostril. My phone buzzes again—long vibrations that mean Lily is calling. I decline the call and immediately regret not letting it ring out for plausible deniability. “Krishna Knudsen, Slapforest?” Xavier says. I tell him I haven’t seen it, even though I have. Margot says she liked it. Xavier launches into a story about a celebrity he met at the New York premiere. The punch line is that they ran into each other the next night at some restaurant. Am I familiar with this restaurant? Tiresome. The facts are: Xavier is rich; Xavier and Margot used to fuck; I am going to fuck her tonight. The last he refuses to see so we have to keep on measuring dicks. For some people, masculine competition is the substrate out of which desire grows or onto which it must inscribe itself. Not for me—I just want to get laid. Xavier repeats his question: Have I been to this new restaurant? I sigh. “I’m not sure I have the energy for whatever it is we’re doing.” Foul! Margot frowns at me for breaking the fourth wall. She enjoys the competition. Who wouldn’t? “Calm down, bro,” Xavier says. “It’s just a restaurant.” Margot laughs with him, but then she says, “Music!” and puts on some music. By assuming responsibility for my discomfort, she is indicating that I still have the inside track, but there will be no shortcuts. Fortunately, Xavier continues to make an ass of himself. Commenting on the music: “Isn’t it weird how we wear out the songs we like until we don’t like them anymore? We don’t have to.” “Yeah,” Margot says. “Why don’t I listen to every song the perfect amount?” Xavier smirks, pleased with their banter. Margot hooks my ankle with her foot. For another hour or two, we go on like this: little jokes at Xavier’s expense, heavy eye contact when he glances down, hurried kissing and groping while he’s in the bathroom. When he takes out his phone and texts his dealer, Margot finally loses patience. Xavier looks tired—didn’t he say he had something to do tomorrow? Xavier responds by drinking from the bottle. He stops making eye contact, glances sourly at the empty bottle, complains about the lack of alcohol, tries to come to terms with the situation. I don’t enjoy this part; I’ve been on the receiving end myself. “You’re killing me, Margot.” Xavier wants to hear a particular song, but she won’t play it. He sings a few bars, humming where he can’t remember the words, which is most places. Margot disappears into her bedroom. The words Xavier can remember are: “My dog’s on fire, and it’s cold online.” I don’t recognize them or the melody. I doubt anyone could. Margot comes out of her bedroom wearing a robe: Xavier should call a car, she says. He asks me if I want to split the Uber with him. Tempting, I say, but I’m going another direction. I excuse myself to use the bathroom so Margot can kick him out. I get up after the condom breaks. We have only the one between us. In sex ed they taught us that a condom should have a little nipple at the end, a “reservoir tip,” it was called, that prevented the prophylactic from bursting under the pressure of ejaculation. By the time I started having sex, all condoms had adopted this innovation, so I don’t know if the old kind really burst like that. It’s a nice thought, though, condoms breaking not in the middle of the act as they actually do, but at the end when there’s nothing you can do about it. My sense is that if I stay, this woman will let me fuck her without a condom, but by now the unanswered messages and calls from Lily have burst through the reservoir tip into my forebrain, so to speak. You can imagine the arc of these texts if you’ve ever sent or received similar. They begin around 5 pm (it’s after midnight now), gently inquiring after my whereabouts. She’s slept well and now she wants to have sex, so where am I? She’s guessing that lunch became drinks, which is fine, but now she’s awake in my place alone, which is weird, so can I please call her? She’s called me a few times and she’s starting to worry. Could I please call her back? Okay, she’s starting to get angry. This is really fucked up. She feels crazy, is considering phoning the police to report me missing. She isn’t angry, just worried. She isn’t worried, just livid. Why the fuck aren’t I answering my phone? I fire off a response as soon as I finish reading. The back seat of the cab smells like new vinyl. On the radio, a reporter says something nice about a Kurdish militia and then takes it back with a sweeping caveat. I’m on my way home Total disaster Minor crisis, almost a major crisis Lost my phone Will explain in person \nExplain now. I’m way ahead of her. Like two sentences ahead of her. I highlight and cut those two sentences, reply, “Of course, bear with me,” paste the cut text back into the compose box and continue writing until I’m interrupted by a text from a number I don’t recognize that says, “Margot.” Jesus Christ. Nice meeting you I may have forgotten to flush your toilet... \nYou did Sorry. \nNot a big deal :) Get some sleep. You too Another text from Lily: ? The story I concoct is too elaborate. She’s right that lunch became drinks. During drinks—after, really—my friend got into a scuffle with some SantaCon bros. I managed to extract him, to “de-escalate,” but in the course of doing so, I lost my phone. That’s what I thought, anyway, so we went back to the scene of the fight, but I didn’t find it there. I used my friend’s phone to call mine, but there was no answer. Then I tried to use the “Find My” function on Apple’s website, but the site wouldn’t load, either because my friend’s phone was old or because who knows. I spent the next few hours, the last few, retracing my steps and borrowing phones from strangers to call mine. No one picked up, which I guess she knows, having called it herself. I tried to message her on Facebook with the first phone I borrowed after Robert left, but the woman whose phone it was got upset when she saw Facebook loading and snatched it back like I was trying to steal her identity. Obvious to me now that I should have tried Facebook again from a different stranger’s phone after asking permission, but I was so intent on finding my phone that I kept moving instead of thinking. (I reallllly can’t afford another new one.) Anyway, after checking everywhere else twice, I finally went back to the restaurant where we ate and they had it in the drawer of the hostess lectern (podium?), thank God. I could swear I used it after we left, but apparently not. I doubt any of this makes her feel better. Probably makes her feel worse because she’s gotten involved with a moron... Anyway, I am sorry. Truly. If that means anything at all. She writes back to say she’s unlocking the front door; I better be on my way for real. I respond that I am, of course I am. She starts typing and then stops. I ask the cab driver to pull over a few doors before my apartment in case Lily is watching from the window. I don’t want her to come down because I don’t want her to end up paying. When my card is declined, I make a big show of being surprised, but the driver isn’t buying it. I apologize profusely: he has every right to call the police—it’s my fault. He rolls his eyes. What’s his phone number? I’ll make him whole as soon as my unemployment deposits. “You’re wasting more of my time,” he says. “Get out.” The long text I sent Lily took me nearly the whole cab ride to compose, but with the additional time eaten up by my little performance I can be sure that Lily has read it, probably several times, so we’ll be starting from there, which is good. No need to deliver the story fresh and open up the chance of conflicting versions. She doesn’t have to believe every word. She just has to accept it. I find her as she wants to be found: lying in my bed, naked and miserable. She meets my eyes without moving her head. I perch beside her. She sits up and pulls on a sweater. She says she doesn’t need to be comforted and isn’t interested in an apology. She just wants to clarify a few things: Was I involved in the fight, or only the de-escalation? “Just breaking it up.” She squints. “I try not to fight because I’m not good at it.” This is a critical distinction: a liar would say he’d fought because fighting is sexier than not fighting. Too subtle? I don’t know. Lily is searching my face so I can’t search hers. Between us, on the bed, her phone buzzes. Multiple incoming texts. “Hard to ignore,” she says. “Lil, I—” She pushes an empty glass into my chest. I fill it for her in the bathroom. She drinks the whole thing in one go, wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, and changes course. The details no longer matter. What matters is that I abandoned her, trapped her in my bedroom alone, left her panicked and helpless—for twelve hours! She didn’t think I was so cruel, so malicious, but that’s her fault, she supposes: her notorious poor taste. The accusation of malice offends me. Is this about Psycho? Because it sure as hell isn’t about me. Have I been reckless? Sure. Callous? Okay. But I didn’t aim to hurt her. And she’s been rash, too. She said she was going to call the cops—what’s that about? Worry, she insists. Something terrible might have happened to me. She was trapped; her mind raced to extremes. “‘Trapped’?” I scoff. “You keep saying ‘trapped,’ but you weren’t trapped.” It’s a full-on fight now. “You gave me your key and told me to wait for you. What do you call that?” “You could have left.” “How would you get in?” “You could have hidden the key if the situation was so serious. I could have come to your place to get it. What are you talking about?” Lily starts to sob. She gulps out words between breaths. Her mother abandoned her, her father, oh God, and now me. These are absurd conflations. But Jesus Christ, what have I done? Lily hides her face in her hands, hyperventilating ragged triplets: fff-fff-fff, fff-fff-fff. You don’t cry like that unless you have to, unless your body demands it. A rabbit shakes; it’s an exorcism. I hold her. I coo her name. “I’m sorry,” I say, humming the words. “I’m so sorry.” She is tiny, shuddering, receding, and then, after a while, she comes back. I don’t know I’m hard until I feel her hand through my jeans.

        "story": "The one light we keep on, a mixed-media artwork (enamel and oil on a hardback book cover) by Andrew Cranston. Courtesy the artist and Ingleby, Edinburgh, Scotland\n How to explain to her daughter. Back when she was in college, she had taken a literary seminar for which she’d had to read Kafka’s “Letter to His Father.” After the class had discussed it, the teacher gave them an assignment: write a letter to one of your own parents. Moans and groans, the loudest of which probably had come from her. It was the kind of assignment she hated. She hated writing prompts in general. If she had to write something, let her choose what about. And the Kafka—well, she hadn’t known what to make of it. “It was weird, but not in a good way. You think that because it starts out ‘Dearest Father’ it’s going to be loving, but in fact it’s just one long rant.” The teacher had laughed and said, “I’m not suggesting you actually send your letter.” There was speculation that the letter was in fact not an actual letter but a story. “You mean like autofiction,” said her daughter. “Yes. Except that autofiction hadn’t been invented yet.” She remembered that the teacher had asked the class to reflect on the decision of Kafka’s literary executor and close friend, Max Brod, not only not to destroy Kafka’s writing but to arrange to have much of it published. She was the only one to believe that what Brod had done was wrong. “‘But think what the world would have lost!’” she said, mimicking falsetto voices (the class—the whole college—had been all women). Life would have gone on! The world would have survived! Granted, without one of its most enduringly useful adjectives. “So, you would have burned everything,” the teacher had said, sadly scandalized. “If I believed that’s what my friend really wanted,” she replied, burning in the hot seat herself. Which Brod always claimed that Kafka really had not. Even so, wouldn’t he have drawn a distinction between the publication of his novels and stories and that of his private letters and diaries? “What if everyone behaved that way toward the dead? What would be the point of anyone ever making out a will, or informing loved ones of their final wishes? What makes literary genius an exception?” The morality of it eluded her. “To them, I was like the Taliban blowing up those ancient stone Buddhas,” she said, anachronistically. “And do you still feel the same?” her daughter asked. “I do. Though now I would never argue with anyone about it.” It had come with age: caring less and less what other people thought. When her daughter was born, she had named her Anaïs. Not after the writer, but simply because she thought the name was beautiful. Her daughter had other feelings about it. First, there was the constant annoyance of mispronunciations, including the inevitable (and deliberate) “Anus.” In fourth grade, someone wrote on the whiteboard anaïs? no , anaïsn’t, starting a running joke that dogged her for the rest of the school year. Later: Did your parents name you after that perfume? (She had sniffed it once in a Macy’s and nearly gagged.) By middle school, she had dropped the mark over the ï. Once she was old enough to read Anaïs Nin, she was mortified. Not because of the erotica—she was no prude—but because of the woman’s insufferable narcissistic personality, her droning and pretentious prose. She became Ana for a while until, after reading Little Women for the first time, she adopted, for keeps, Jo. Her mother understood. She had never liked the name her parents gave her, either, preferring her nickname, Mo. Her husband referred to them together as MoJo. They found the letter in the drawer of Mo’s mother’s nightstand, along with a bottle of Tylenol long past its expiration date and a tube of ChapStick. Jo said, “You must have sent it to her.” “I did not,” said Mo. “No way I would’ve done that. And if I had, believe me, I’d remember.” She vividly remembered banging out the manuscript on her aqua-blue Smith Corona manual typewriter, all in one frenzied go, on Dexedrine. Now it was an antique (Jo called it a fossil), the onionskin paper yellowed, the Wite-Out that had been used, in some spots thickly, to cover up mistakes, flaking. The staple holding the flimsy pages together had rusted, and the comments written by the teacher in pencil were too smudged or faded to be legible. Jo asked her mother what the teacher had said. Mo laughed. “She sent me to the school shrink.” Just once had she been to see that dwarfish, bearded old man, comical in his enormous chair, his enormous desk between them, his nose almost touching the legal pad on which he scribbled throughout the session. Known among the students as Pocket Freud. It was a shock to learn that he had not read Mo’s letter. “I remember that he never said a word. I was completely ignorant about therapy. The last thing I was expecting was neutrality. I thought I was going to be comforted, that’s how naïve I was. I didn’t know that’s not how it worked. Anyway, that was the end of it. He didn’t ask me to come back. The teacher never said anything to me, either, and no one ever mentioned the letter again.” But some years later, despondent after being rejected by a man she adored, she’d let a friend talk her into joining a writing group: four other women and two men who’d met earlier as members of a book club. One of the men taught in a university writing program. When some in the group were having trouble coming up with story ideas, he shared a list of prompts that he’d been given as a student and that he sometimes used in his own classes. And there it was again: “You asked me recently why I maintain that I am afraid of you.” The first sentence of Kafka’s letter to his father. Write a story starting with this sentence, went the prompt. When you’ve finished the story, delete the sentence. The story did not have to be in the form of a letter, and “you” could be anyone at all. But Mo wanted to write again about her mother—a mother-daughter story like those that seemed to be so popular. Now she reread Kafka’s letter, and this time she did not find it boring. A parent who made a child feel fearful and worthless; childhood not as a carefree, innocent time, but as a test of endurance. She could relate to that. Again with the encouragement of the friend who’d brought her into the group, and who now insisted that Mo’s mother-daughter story was good enough to be published, she began sending it out to journals. She respectfully obeyed the editors’ rule of no simultaneous submissions, and she always included an SASE. By the time the last rejection note arrived—well over a year after the submission—the sight of her own handwriting on the manila envelope momentarily baffled her: she had forgotten all about the story. She had also left the group. While her story had been making the rounds, she’d managed only a string of false starts and had struggled to hide her lack of interest in the others’ writing. Sometime before the onset of her last illness, Mo’s mother had listened to an audiobook about Swedish death cleaning and had taken to heart its advice: declutter your home as much as possible to spare others the trouble once you’ve passed on. For this Mo was grateful. She knew people who’d had to deal for weeks and months with that particular chore. It helped that her mother had already downsized to a cottage in the same Long Island town where she’d lived from the time of her marriage to Mo’s father, who’d died when Mo was eight. The marriage had been sufficiently unhappy—mostly because of his alcoholism, which was also to blame for cutting short his life—for her mother not to want to chance it again. Mo’s own marriage had been only slightly less awful—another heavy drinker, Hugh was also a serial cheater—but they’d managed to stay together until Jo was on her own. Though it was not to be, in anticipation of having a second child they had moved, after Jo was born, from New York to Philadelphia, where the cost of living was lower, and where the consulting firm for which Hugh worked had a branch and was willing to transfer him. Mo worked as an ER nurse until, one day in her forties, a misstep sent her somersaulting down a flight of stairs like a stuntman. She had back surgery and spent half a year recuperating, but she was never up to the physical demands of nursing again. She took a job supervising a large medical office—as stressful though not as exciting as the ER, thanks to the harrowing bureaucracy of the health-care system—from which she could not wait to retire. Jo lived in Chicago, where she’d attended grad school with some dream of becoming a psychologist but ended up marrying the owner of an Italian restaurant that had been in his family for three generations and which then became hers as well. The restaurant had barely survived the pandemic lockdown and had been struggling ever since. When Mo saw that they’d raised the prices so that even a bowl of pasta with red sauce cost more than twenty dollars, she said, “Well, there’s your problem right there. Who can afford it?” Jo explained that their prices were not the problem, that it was the restaurant’s rising expenses that were the problem, and in fact the restaurant was packed every night. “And we don’t call it red sauce,” she said. “Oh, excuse me,” said Mo. “I didn’t mean it like that.” Jo had slipped. Usually she was more careful around her mother. She had learned long ago that a person who was much criticized as a child grows up to be not hardened or immune but, rather, hypersensitive. Even mild criticism, even if it was undeniably justified, caused her mother to overreact, becoming defensive and sullen. Many a fine day had been spoiled in just this manner. Whenever Jo was frustrated by Mo’s behavior, she reminded herself that Mo really had suffered at the hands of her own mother. “Every single day, every little thing, wrong wrong wrong, bad bad bad.” She had even tried to blame her husband’s troubles on little Mo and her two brothers. “What man wants to come home to a house full of whiny, dirty brats?” she’d snap at them. “No wonder Daddy drinks.” If they’d been rich, she would have shipped them all off to boarding school. Something Jo had learned in psychology: when a person has had a bad parent, the person remains that parent’s child all their life. Jo had flown to Philadelphia on a Friday, and she and Mo drove to Long Island early the next morning. Passing through her hometown, Mo pointed out how much had changed over the gentrifying years, with less than a handful of the old mom-and-pop places surviving among the chic new ones. “What’s that for?” Jo asked about a long line of people on one street. As they went by they saw that it was for a patisserie—specifically, for the crookies that were sold there, according to a signboard out front. “Oh, I heard about those,” said Mo. “You have to line up early to buy one, because they sell out right away. You can get them in Philadelphia now too.” “And in Chicago,” said Jo. “They must be so good,” said Mo, hungrily. But Jo said, “It’s not about the taste, Mom, it’s about the hype. People always want whatever the latest viral food trend is.” Which she thought was ridiculous. But Mo, who had a history of stress-eating and a constant craving for comfort foods, was empathetic. In her office she’d once heard a patient who’d been sternly warned by the doctor to lose weight protest: “But food is the only sex I have.” Mo had estimated that it wouldn’t take more than a weekend to sort through her mother’s things. Another reason to be grateful: there’d be no need to deal with the house itself, which was a rental. Over the years, Mo’s mother had become friendly with her landlord, who lived nearby, and she had agreed to leave him the cottage’s furniture. Before going into hospice, she had arranged for someone from a local donation center to pick up the dozen boxes of clothes and housewares now stacked and waiting in the hall. They were scheduled to come that Monday. Jo said, “Grandma really thought of everything, didn’t she.” There was not much that Mo needed or wanted for herself, but she picked out a few mementos, mostly photographs and pieces of jewelry, and a pair of Art Deco lamps that had been one of her parents’ wedding gifts—nothing that wouldn’t fit in the car. Neither of Mo’s brothers had volunteered to help, being the kind of men who viewed this sort of task as women’s work. “They’d only be in the way,” Mo said. “They’d only slow us down.” Her brothers had considered everything else having to do with their mother’s illness and dying also to be women’s work. But at least they had shown up for the end. Mo forgave the boys, as she always referred to them, because she understood how complicated grief was in a family like theirs. The anguish of mourning not just the death of a parent but a parent’s love that never was. From being hypercritical of her children their mother had moved on, once they were grown, to indifference. With every year, she became less and less informed about their lives. Some years she might send a birthday card, other years not. The arrival of grandchildren changed nothing. If anyone had asked her anything beyond their names and ages, she could not have said much. Her detached manner at family gatherings suggested that she’d just as soon have been somewhere else. Mo never understood how her mother survived the isolation. She had a few acquaintances, and she got along well with her neighbors, but she had nothing like a bosom friend. She did not even have a pet. (She was afraid of dogs and superstitious about cats.) She had a hobby—gardening—and she had her favorite TV shows, and the audiobooks that she borrowed from the library. She was a regular churchgoer, her reverence for priests surpassed only by her reverence for the pope, and when her youngest had screwed up his courage to tell her he was gay, she’d let Father Gaffney guide her. Her son was a sinner; it would be sinful to condone or accept who he was. Just as she’d thought. During the lockdown, she had taken up backyard birding. While she was in the hospital, when Mo went to collect some things for her from her house, she’d noticed a complaining racket at the empty feeder. And for the first time since she’d learned of her mother’s diagnosis, she had wept, thinking that, more than any human, the birds would miss her. In midlife had come a time when thoughts of her mother ceased to torment Mo. She had her work, a husband and child, no shortage of friends, hobbies of her own. But, getting older, she often found herself jarred by flashbacks or brooding about the past. On Mother’s Day, a radio host invited call-ins: “Tell us about your mom, how you like to remember her, what was special about her.” Mo wondered for how many listeners those words would mean the opening of a wound. She remembered what a convicted criminal was once reported to have told a judge: “My mother taught me that there was no such thing as mercy.” Not that she thought there was any such thing as a perfect family, of course. But the world was full of examples of what was held to be not some high ideal but the norm: parents who loved their kids, who protected them, who wanted them to be happy. And, futile though she knew it to be, resentment at having been deprived of this—what to call it? was it a right? not a privilege, surely?—threaded her days. “I’ve always felt like the hungry, penniless kid with her nose pressed against the bakery window,” she said. It was called luck, of course. She had been unlucky in her parents. But the luck of being born into love shouldn’t be like the luck of being born into money, should it? She could not recall a single instance when her mother had shown guilt for something she’d said or done. The guilt was all on Mo’s side, a sense of unworthiness and self-horror that was like a kind of dirt that couldn’t be washed off. Like the shame that Kafka said he was afraid would outlive him. Out of shame, young Mo had traded the truth about her background for a book of lies. A college friend who saw through it all had once accused her of being emotionally disturbed; she needed to get help, the friend said. (But who to turn to? Father Gaffney? Pocket Freud?) It was this mire of shame and humiliation and denial that she believed helped explain why she and her brothers had failed to bond. As if escaping the pain of the past had somehow required escaping one another. And the last thing either of the boys ever wanted to do was talk about it: that would have meant reliving it. She didn’t get to choose her parents. But why later, given a choice, was she driven to choose badly, drawn time and again to men whose rough childhoods matched her own, only to discover how inauspicious this was for a couple? It was only in hindsight that she saw clearly that her and Hugh’s hope of turning two dark pasts into one bright future had been doomed from the start. Yet the most wonderful blessing had come of it. Through the years, she and Jo had thrived together. They were as devoted as any mother and child. They were each other’s best friend. They were MoJo! (Once, when Hugh had tried to excuse his infidelities by saying that it sometimes seemed as if the two of them had no need for anyone else, and that he felt left out, Mo was outraged. But later she saw that the assertion contained a kernel of truth.) There had been a time, however, when the relationship had been seriously tested. Jo was just twenty then and dating a man ten years older: the owner of a tattoo parlor. It had always amazed Mo how tattoos had come to be so common. People who’d never expect to wear the same wardrobe or hairstyle for life: How could they think they’d want to be stuck forever with the same tattoos, let alone the flamboyantly gaudy or lurid ones that were now ubiquitous? She remembered reading an article about people’s tendency to be shortsighted even in matters of major importance, from retirement plans to climate change. According to studies, the human brain was very bad at grasping the reality of the future. Most people could not imagine, let alone worry about, their own future selves, because those selves were like strangers to them. Well, if any were needed, thought Mo, tattoos were it: proof of humans’ devil-may-care nature and why our world had come to be in the sorry state that it was. During the years Jo and her boyfriend were together, every time Mo saw her daughter, another patch of skin had been sacrificed. (The man himself was as tattooed as a Russian gangster.) How could Jo say that he was only making her more and more beautiful? What did Mo care that some committee had named him one of his city’s top ten tattoo artists? To her, he was not an artist; he was a vandal. And what about the risks? She was not just a pearl-clutching boomer; she was a nurse. Even if there wasn’t indisputable evidence of a link between tattoos and cancer, at least some inks were known to contain carcinogens. And how could a person with all that inked skin catch the kind of small change in pigmentation that was a sign of melanoma? Though as dismayed about the situation as Mo, Hugh was no help. “I say we kidnap the bastard and strap him down and tattoo dickhead across his face.” Then Mo made a bad miscalculation. She would call Jo’s boyfriend and try to talk to him about her concerns. His flippant attitude (“He must have said ‘whatever’ ten times,” she reported later) had incensed her. When Jo learned what Mo had done, it was her turn to be incensed. Though they did not suffer a complete break, Jo decided that what mother and daughter needed was a lot more distance between them. It gave Mo no satisfaction to know that she was right, that there would come a day when Jo would regret how she looked. The tattoo artist was not an addict, but he was a user, and one night when he was alone in his shop he accidentally overdosed. Witnessing her daughter’s prostration, Mo understood something she hadn’t fully acknowledged before: how deeply Jo cared, how much this man had meant to her. Mo herself had not yet experienced such a terrifying, disabling grief. It rendered Jo an invalid. There were days when, if she didn’t want her child to starve, Mo had to spoon-feed her. “Only you could have gotten me through it,” said Jo, when she was finally able to move on. Jo said, “Well, if you didn’t send it to her, how did it get here?” When Mo’s mother was moving from her old house to the cottage, she had called Mo to say that she’d come across a box of stuff from Mo’s college days, some old course notebooks and term papers. Did she want them, or was it okay to throw them out? “I told her to throw them out,” said Mo. “It didn’t occur to me that she might look through them—she’d never shown any interest in what I was studying in college—and if she did, why would I care? I never even thought about the letter being there. Think how many decades it’s been.” Could it have been a subconscious act, leaving the letter where her mother might one day find it? was a thought Jo kept to herself. “And she never said anything to you,” said Jo. No, she had never said anything. She had gotten rid of everything else in the box, but this one thing she had saved. And placed it there, in her nightstand drawer, so that Mo could not miss it: her love letter. Dearest Mother, I have always believed, and I still believe, that if you would only let me I could make you happy. “She was old,” said Jo. “She was sick, and she was on all those medications. She must have been confused.” Mo said, “Don’t you dare make excuses for her.” Jo was wondering whether to ask if she could read the letter when she saw that her mother’s face had turned blotchy. Her mouth was twitching, and she was breathing so hard that she was grunting. She began tearing up the pages, her hands working furiously, sending scraps of paper flying into the air. After Mo had left the room, Jo swept up the pieces and dumped them in the trash. For the rest of the day they worked mostly in silence, urgently and so efficiently that they managed almost to finish the job. By then it was dark. They ate the rotisserie chicken and potato salad they’d bought on the way in from town, discussed whether to watch a movie, agreed that they were too tired, and went to bed. On the phone with her husband, Jo confessed that she’d been relieved when her mother tore up the letter. “I was afraid to read it,” she said. “I mean, afraid I wouldn’t know what to say.” She was alarmed to hear her young son’s voice in the background. “At this hour?” she said. “I know,” said her husband. “But he’s not being very cooperative. He wants you home.” “I want me home, too,” said Jo. After only a day she felt as if she’d been gone for a week. She was trying not to dwell on the fact that, since Mo had picked her up at the airport, not once had she asked after her son-in-law or her grandson. Mo woke up the next morning to a delicious smell. Jo was already up and busy in the kitchen, making coffee. The smell was coming from the toaster oven. Mo peered through the glass and gasped. “You got crookies!” Jo said, “I was just keeping them warm.” They ate breakfast on the front porch, ignoring the damp that the sun was as yet too weak to evaporate from the wicker furniture. Hope had not died among the birds: back and back they came to the feeder hanging empty from a tree branch. “This reminds me of a story,” said Jo. “A famous Carver story.” Mo said, “Which Kafka story?” “Not Kafka. Carver.” Jo had noticed that, since their last visit, at Christmas, her mother had developed some hearing loss. She’d already decided that, before flying home, she would say something to her. She’d have to be delicate about it, though, so that Mo wouldn’t react defensively. “Raymond Carver,” Jo said. “Remember him? I can’t think of the title.” The grief of a couple whose little boy has just died is interrupted by nasty anonymous phone calls, which turn out to be from the baker to whom they owe money for the birthday cake they had ordered for the dead child but had never picked up. When the couple goes to his store to confront him, the mortified baker apologizes and offers them coffee and cinnamon rolls hot out of the oven. Jo said, “He urges them to eat, because when you’re in pain, he says, eating can be a comfort.” “Hmm,” said Mo, nodding emphatically with her mouth full. “‘A Small, Good Thing.’” “Hmm?” “That’s what the story is called. I just remembered. The baker calls eating in a time of trouble a small, good thing.” “Well, I wouldn’t call these small,” said Mo. “But didn’t I say how good they’d be?” Early though it had been when Jo took the car into town, there was already a line outside the patisserie for the crookies—no surprise on a Sunday morning. She had no intention of joining it, but she went inside and bought two fresh-baked croissants and one large, soft chocolate chip cookie. Back at the house, she sliced open each croissant, placed a piece of the cookie inside, and another piece on top, and she heated the croissants in the toaster oven to melt everything together. Mo said, “This is the best pastry I ever had.” Maybe once they were on the road, their grim task done, Grandma’s house receding farther and farther behind—maybe then Jo would tell Mo the truth, and they could laugh about it. She liked to think that, whenever her mother thought back to this time, its bitterness might be countered by the memory of something funny, something warm and sweet, a reminder that in her grief she had been comforted, and that she was loved.

        "story": "On the first of June, 1901, Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, a doctor and writer of short stories and plays, a famous man who also suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs and intestines, sat at a table, surrounded by other consumptives, before a bottle of mare’s milk and an enameled tin cup. It was his first morning in Aksionovo, at the Andreev sanatorium, a thousand miles from Moscow. He had come with his wife, Olga, on the recommendation of a specialist, who, two weeks prior, had told him in no uncertain terms that great measures needed to be taken, both lungs were damaged with irreversible necrosis, no longer could he expect to forestall the bacillus by simply wintering in Yalta. He had two choices—Switzerland, or koumiss, mare’s milk, fermented by Bashkir herdsmen, and renowned in circles both fashionable and medical for its curative effects. Count Tolstoy, added the specialist, had also been to Bashkiria, many times, for his nerves. Chekhov thought of Tolstoy as an ignorant crank who held too many opinions on topics that he knew nothing about, particularly scientific ones—and as a writer of such perfection and beauty as to validate the entire existence of literature itself. Was there not something closer? he asked. But no, the doctor told him, for koumiss could come only from the milk of steppe-grazed mares, and it quickly lost its healing properties when the horses were transported from their native land. But surely Anton Pavlovich knew this, being a physician himself. Surely he must have prescribed it to patients of his own. In answer, Chekhov coughed and shook his head. For his patients were poor, paid no fees, and could not afford the journey, let alone the sanatorium. When he had recommended it—and there had been a few times—it was to friends only, advanced cases for whom other therapies had failed. The journey had taken six days. From Moscow, they had endured a train whose windows wouldn’t open, mutinous passengers, two errors in the timetables, a crowded steamship, a night in the rain and on a quayside floor where an old man spat behind a sheet that functioned as a bedroom wall. Somehow, in each town they entered, well-wishers, preternaturally alerted to his presence, came to harry them, and yet in Aksionovo, they couldn’t find a driver, and had to rustle up a carriage from the alehouse. By the time they arrived at the sanatorium, it was midnight and the doctor had gone to sleep. It took a long time before the bell was answered by the sound of shuffling footsteps. The door opened before a servant so pretty that Anton, for a moment, found himself speechless. As Olga spoke their names, the girl’s eyes widened. For the doctor had been waiting. They all were waiting. And there was mail, and telegrams, and the other guests... Chekhov felt a twinge in his chest and touched the flask he carried in his pocket for surreptitiously spitting blood. Not now, he thought, not before someone so lovely, so full of life! But it passed, and the girl was too excited to notice he’d stepped slightly back into the dark. She had heard that they’d only recently been married, the papers had reported it, she would show them copies, yes, in Ufa, they had reported on the arrival of the great writer Anton Chekhov and his newly wed actress, so famous herself. And here they were. How wonderful it was that they should come to Aksionovo on their honeymoon! The koumiss would restore him, for his bride. And even in the dim light of her candle, she seemed to blush. “Please,” said Olga. “We are very tired.” And the girl took a quick breath as if swallowing the many other things she wished to tell them, slipped into a pair of bast sandals, and led them on a path around the house. There were no lights. She brought the candle, though it wasn’t necessary, the sky was clear, a half-moon shone on a garden with a silent fountain. The night was calm, not a single leaf stirred in the trees. Even the candle’s flame was still. And she walked so lightly! A grassy avenue rose past cabins set amid the birches. Theirs was at the edge of the grove, with a view over the steppe, the very last—for privacy, said the girl. The doctor felt it was important for his celebrated patient’s rest. Two steps led up to a porch on which a canvas chair stood folded and propped against the wall. Inside, the room was so spare as to look unfinished. Two stools, a table, a pair of beds. There were no linens or pillows—hadn’t they been told that guests should bring their own?—and it took another hour for the girl to rummage up a set back at the clinic, returning to find the travelers asleep on the bare mattresses. After a moment’s hesitation she left the pile folded by the bed of the man who slept with labored breath, and looked so frail, so ill. The next morning, Chekhov found himself in the office of the doctor, Varavka. On the wall were photos of dancers and singers, hung like icons around a decorated, light-blue linen towel, similarly framed. Varavka himself was a round man, with red eyebrows and a great red priest’s beard that made up for the baldness of his head. Exhausted by their travels, the Chekhovs had slept late that morning, rising only with the rapping of the servant girl bringing coffee. It had taken Anton nearly an hour to get ready. His guts had detained him, and he had made the walk with his hat low over his face, suffused not only with a general fatigue, but with the lingering, polluted sense, familiar in such attacks, that he bore with him the air of the latrine. To his relief, they had passed few other patients on the way down to the main house—a man reading in a canvas chair outside his cabin, and three women in white dresses. It was clear they knew who he was; they stared a little before nodding in greeting. But they also must have recognized the grim exhaustion, and didn’t speak. Compared with the night before, the grounds seemed of a different setting altogether; the enchantment had lifted, weeds overgrew the garden, paint peeled from the house, and the pool beneath the fountain, in which he’d seen the moon just ten hours prior, was green with algae. He had left Olga back at the cabin, and so was greeted alone at the door by the doctor, who—like a man uncertain of the conventions of another’s culture—patted Chekhov, hugged Chekhov, kissed Chekhov’s shoulder, shook Chekhov’s hand, and seemed vaguely annoyed when Chekhov began to cough. The examining room was on the first floor, a mercy, for he was already so out of breath from the walk that he could scarcely mutter an apology, and he was grateful, upon taking his seat, hands clasped around his cane, that the doctor launched into his greeting. For they were so pleased that he had come to Aksionovo! Everyone was excited, he had so many admirers among the other patients, they couldn’t believe their fortune. Indeed, Varavka, though he had cared for many famous patients, was overjoyed by the honor of caring for not just such a great man but a colleague. He had read in the papers about the timetables, and Agafya—this was the servant—had told him about the carriages, or absence of them, and he was sorry. But here they were! And he was certain Chekhov would find that it was worth the trouble. There wasn’t a soul who wasn’t greatly helped by koumiss, and he rose and took down the framed towel from the wall and brought it over. On it were signatures of other famous guests, which he’d subsequently embroidered, so that they would never fade. And like a little boy who shares a precious toy, he looked to Chekhov’s face to see what he might think. What Chekhov thought was that he regretted taking the advice of the Moscow specialist, that Varavka had done nothing to dispel the general reputation of sanatorium doctors as charlatans, and that he was about to have another attack of his bowels. With a hot wave, the sensation passed. Varavka sat, flourished his paper, and dipped his pen. And Chekhov, who, perhaps more than anything, hated to be treated by another doctor as a patient, spoke first. “The historia morbi.” Latin: the story of the disease. He would dictate, and the doctor would take notes. For two decades of his life, nearly as long as he had written fiction, Chekhov was accustomed to also recording stories of a different kind, a vast oeuvre, set down in clinic notes and hospital reports. Indeed, when asked about his earliest stories, he thought not only of the five-kopek-a-line parodies, but his first case summaries. It was one of these summaries that he gave Varavka now. He did not speak for long: he was, of course, a master of concision. And while he was modest by nature, it was not lost on him that the history he shared was a near perfection of the form, integrating medical knowledge with his gift for narrative tension and psychological insight. And part of him, a little part of him, thought it a shame that such a creation be offered only to an audience of one. He spoke of his family tree, rotted with tuberculosis, the close quarters of his childhood, his early cough and troubles of the bowels, the first blood, the sudden hemorrhages, copious, terrifying, seizing him each spring in ever-quickening succession. He outlined his fear of spinal tuberculosis, and why he suspected he’d been spared this, just as he’d been spared the horrors that had filled his examining room, tuberculosis of the eye, the mouth, the skin. And he listed the treatments—creosote, subcutaneous arsenic, compresses, cupping—that had failed. “That,” he said, “is everything.” Except it wasn’t, and he knew that he could have equally told the story another way, that in the past year and a half, he’d written a single play and begun the story of a dying bishop, but had failed to finish it. That since his childhood he had cared for his entire family, they depended on him like a father, he had a dead brother, a dissolute brother, a widowed mother, a spinster sister who resented his wife. That he felt at times to be a crayfish in a crowded trap. That from all of them he now was fleeing, and at times it seemed as if it were not the bacillus but their demands on him, the world’s demands on him, that took away his air. That one of the reasons he had come was that he had just gotten married, knew that his mother and his sister and his brother questioned his bride’s intentions, and feared his family’s response. Feared the world’s response, the world’s attentions. That once, soon after his brother’s death, he’d written a story of a dying man whom fame had robbed forever of his simple joys, his cabbage soup, his goose with apples. And that was twelve years back, when he could not have anticipated the lines of petitioners. For interventions, letters, statements, favors, treatments, or simply a moment in his presence. Pieces of me, he told Olga. Consuming me in bits. And so, when the doctor rose and motioned him to the examining table, Chekhov said coldly, “Is it necessary? There is necrosis in both lungs. It hasn’t changed since I was examined two weeks ago in Moscow.” Varavka looked at him, and then to the paper on his desk, now dark with Chekhov’s story. There was a long pause. From nearby came the sound of a bell. The doctor clapped his hands together. Of course, the exam could wait. Now was the hour of the day’s first gathering for koumiss! And that was why Anton Pavlovich had come. The doctor led him out of the clinic and into a small garden, ringed by birches and a second, smaller circle of apple trees, where long tables were set and the other patients were waiting. There, too, was Olga, whose eyes followed Chekhov with concern. He pitied her, he always pitied her. She had married a sick man, his body had made this clear from the beginning. Always sick, always breathless, his lovemaking constantly interrupted by his coughing or his guts. It was not unreasonable that his family wondered what she truly wanted. He had always held a dim view of marriage; his Collected Works, volumes of which were being prepared that very instant in St.Petersburg, was, on some level, a giant fictional indictment of the institution. You will get a grandfather, not a husband, he had written her before their wedding. But something—love, maybe, or his acceptance of his illness, or maybe the opposite, denial, for what dying man gets married?—something had prompted him to propose their secret ceremony. And here she was, his bride, star of his theater, sitting patiently at the table with consumptives likely pestering her for gossip from the stage. Conversation stopped. Varavka presented “Anton Pavlovich Chekhov,” and added, with the fanfare of a man accustomed to a doting audience, “Be careful what you say around him—he might put you in a play!” There was laughter, and Chekhov smiled thinly. Around the table, introductions went—Sokolov, a retired general—a lawyer, Voronin—a pair of cousins, pale young men, one broad, one fine—the wife of a Swiss consul—an architect—two men who gave their aristocratic titles—a privy councilor who introduced himself by civil rank. One of the ladies was a singer with a provincial opera; Chekhov hadn’t heard of her. The rest of them were wives and husbands. He sat, received the greetings graciously, grace being both his gift and curse. Silence followed. He caught an exchange of glances, as if the gathered party was waiting to see which of them was bold enough to speak. And he knew what was going through their minds, for he had been presented to many circles, many tables. Should they tell him that they loved “The Grasshopper”? That they’d seen The Seagull in Moscow? Read “Kashtanka” to their grandchildren? He could see it in their bearing and their faces, knew that when each one returned from Aksionovo, “Anton Pavlovich” would be the story that they told. For they had met a great man, and when he was weak, yes, maybe even dying. Yes, truly Chekhov! And on his honeymoon! And yet so ill, as sick as everybody else. When he was a young doctor, Chekhov had a patient who had once served Pushkin at a coaching inn. The man was very old, dying of a cancer of the lungs. Somewhere in the vast world were his children and grandchildren, and yet as he died, he spoke of Pushkin, and how Pushkin had carried himself so elegantly, and asked for a second glass of water, and how Pushkin had finished his soup but barely touched his rice. At each place at the table were a bottle and a tin cup, and here and there were plates of strawberries. A faint, sour smell rose from the milk. Four times a day, thought Chekhov. Was he to perform the great man here, in the wilds of Bashkiria, where he had come to rest? Voronin wore dye in his beard—Chekhov could see it on his cheeks. And the white dresses hung so unnaturally on the women, as if they thought that they were beautiful and didn’t know that they were sick. Olga must have sensed his exhaustion, for beneath the table, she took his hand. And he readied himself to grant them what they wished. But the general was the first to speak. Was it true that it was Chekhov’s first time drinking mare’s milk? Well, yes and no, said Chekhov, relieved, and maybe even a little—not disappointed—surprised, to be asked about something other than his writing. Yes, in the market, but not on the steppe, not at a sanatorium. “A virgin of koumiss!” said the general, and there was laughter, and some blushes from the ladies at the table, though they didn’t drop their eyes. Yes, they were all staring at him, and then he understood that it was so they could watch him drink. He looked at Olga, and then over to the doctor, who himself had taken a seat at the table. Very well, he thought, and took the cup into which the general had ceremoniously poured the milk. Now, closer, the smell was actually sickening. He sipped. “All wrong!” the general told him. “Not slow, my writer! No, not gently! In a gulp!” Why, this is so absurd, I wouldn’t dare to put it in a story, thought Chekhov, as he raised the koumiss to his lips. It tasted, as he recalled from years before, like sour chalk, and whey, and beery, rotten cream. “Well?” asked Sokolov. They’ve gone crazy, thought Chekhov. And he wished to shout out that they were dying, that tuberculosis was implacable, that nothing could cure them, that the best they could hope for was not to be unduly tortured on their way to death. But then something was happening, a breeze passed through the apple trees, he blinked twice, the birch leaves shimmered like falling coins, a jackdaw called, the ruffles on the blouses of the women fluttered once, together. Olga reached over and handed him a napkin. “Your beard,” she said, and laughter followed. “Another?” asked the general. The man poured, Chekhov drank, the bubbles from the ferment seemed to rise into his eyes. How strange! he thought. It couldn’t be, but he felt better. Impossible! The koumiss worked by fortifying the body—this took weeks or months. And yet something was happening. He drank, tears filled his eyes, a faint effervescence; it seemed as if he were staring at the exultant party from beneath the shifting surface of a pond. Around him was the smell of strawberries, lavender drifted from the neck of the wife of the Swiss consul, and there was rose, and lilac—yes, the women all wore perfume, how had he not noticed? He drank again, the taste had changed, sweeter now, as if he could perceive the very grass on which the horses fed. He wiped his lips. Olga was looking at him, quizzically, and it occurred to him that what was happening now was not entirely new, but that it was simply a long time since he’d been drunk. Of course! What a fool not to have thought of this immediately! The ferment wasn’t strong, but given how frail he was, how thin, how long he had been banned from wine or spirits.... Oh, how pleasant it was, he thought, to be drunk outside at midday, to be giddy in the sunshine. And with such companions! Now, halfway through the bottle, he loved his companions, such good, kind, joyful people. And they asked nothing of him, no introduction to an editor, no political statement, no loan, no intervention with the police for a cousin’s wayward friend, nor did they question his marriage or his bride’s intentions. No, he had been welcomed at the table simply for what he was, a consumptive, an eater of strawberries, a drinker of mare’s milk. From around the table came the sound of final slurps and clinking cups and drinkers rising. An hour had passed, the morning koumiss was finished; he had been so lost in the sense of well-being that he had scarcely noticed. The doctor announced that he was going to fish in the river. Sokolov would join; could Chekhov come? But Sokolov’s wife was quicker. “Stepan Andreevich! This is a married man, and on his honeymoon. And you would take him from his wife?” Now most of the guests had left the table. The cousins’ arms were interlocked. Voronin had his arm around his wife, and as they sallied forth her dress snagged briefly on the roses. It was almost obscene, thought Chekhov, this coupling. He felt as he once had in certain houses back in Moscow, when the meal ended and the customers would choose the girls of their desiring. For were the cousins really cousins? They looked into each other’s eyes so dotingly. And what was the little wife of the privy councilor now whispering that made his neck turn red? They followed, the white dresses swayed like tipsy ghosts, someone stumbled into the lilacs. It was warm and still, and as they walked up the avenue that ran between the cabins, he watched the couples drift inside, swaying, one by one he saw them draw the damask curtains, the men unbuttoning their cuffs, the women reaching up to pull their hairpins from their hair. Inside, he closed the door. His new wife turned to him. “I think,” he said, “that I have been remiss in my appreciation of this miraculous drink.” Gently, he drew her body against his. “Oh dear, it really is miraculous,” she said. They became great nappers, loungers, laze-abouters, drinkers of koumiss. The hours vanished. They left their watches entangled in a suitcase, ticking in syncopation, until first one, and then the other, stopped. Woke with Agafya’s knocking when she brought them coffee in the morning, or—when he was too drunk, too sleepy, to go down—his milk. And he would drink it there on the veranda, bow to the girl and set the tin back on her tray, and, satiated, stomach sloshing, return inside, where Olga waited. Naked but for their bedsheets, eyes inquiring, It’s nearly noon, would he like to take a stroll, or something else? And the answer, always: something else. It was astonishing, he thought, as the days melted into one another, and they moved dreamily from bed to table and back again. Had someone asked him what to expect of convalescence, he never would have thought to say: lasciviousness, an uncontainable, colossal lust. At first, he thought that it was simply drunkenness. Drink provoked desire, didn’t it? Persuaded lechery: and this on the authority of no less than Shakespeare. But as the days passed, and he found his bowels settling, and flesh returning to his bones, five pounds then ten, he found desire rushing back. And not one of his professors had mentioned this, nor could he recall it from a textbook. A secret! thought Chekhov. And he told himself that he should write it: Chapter 42, the consumptive on return to health will find himself sixteen again but with an old man’s knowledge. He will become a satyr, will forget his rotten lungs, and in the wind, he’ll hear the sounds of smacking lips. Will tangle in the sheets, and drive the mattress off its wicker frame, and wake only to find himself seized once again by lust.  Will be rendered speechless by a missing button on the blouse of the wife of the Swiss consul, and the way the wind brushed back Agafya’s hair to show her collarbone. And the wet, laboring fingers of the milkmaids, and the milk smell of his wife. For Olga also drank it. At first, worried about her weight, she’d taken only sips of the elixir, before she had relented, joining the patients in their revelry. In the mornings, rising from their bed, he watched her palms appraise her breasts, the gathering roll about her waist. You do not understand, she said, in answer to his murmuring appreciation. You do not have to face the tailor, the gossip of the other actresses, the papers. It is not the same for writers, the world does not ask for slender ankles on the men who write the plays. But then two hours later, sitting with him naked on their stools, koumiss before them, she watched him, black-eyed, before they locked their arms and drank. And as the days passed, and their astonishment at such a convalescence settled into a calmer, measured bliss, they wandered. By then they had come to know the other guests and Chekhov sensed his novelty had vanished. Indeed, the others even seemed to have forgotten who he was. Sometimes, the consul’s wife, a reader, gushing over Tolstoy or Turgenev, would pull up short, but this was rare, and it amused him. When at last she spoke of his plays—and she’d seen all of them, well, the famous ones—it seemed as if they were just discussing friends they held in common. And she would leave off from Uncle Vanya, and tell him of her own Vanya, her boy, who’d had such trouble at the academy, and of how Natasha in Three Sisters reminded her of her mother, who had torn up their orchard simply because the trees were old and rotted, though they still gave such fine fruit. He suspected that she loved him. Sometimes, when he was walking, she mysteriously appeared. It amused him, and even Olga, when he woke her in their bed, would tease him: “Go to your girlfriend, Anton!” And then: “Antosha, it is the middle of the night. I also came for rest... Dearest, won’t you tire out?” But he’d been tiring out for seventeen years. Daytimes, leaving his sleeping wife, he joined the doctor on his fishing expeditions, listened to the general tell of his campaigns. And while the doctor enjoyed talking about his famous patients, he enjoyed talking about fishing even more. The truth was—he confessed, sotto voce, in the middle of the stream, with only Chekhov and Sokolov to hear him—he had come to the sanatorium because of the fishing. You could find roach and dace and ide, and pike in the lakes, and even perch and taimen. Yes, he told Chekhov and the general as he rowed upstream, his strong, pink arms flexing against the oars, he lived for fishing, to cast for trout in the rapids, to use a long line, to watch it fall so softly on the water. But just as much he loved the slow water, to fish for eelpout with a minnow—yes, that was the best, to catch a minnow and then use it to catch an eelpout, though he always felt a little sad to see the creature twist. On good days, he gave his catch to the cooks to prepare for the patients. His eyes lit up when he spoke, and Chekhov forgave him the wall of photos and the embroidered towel. For he loved being the person he was then, a man hearing a story of a fish. Sometimes, he tried to get a word in—who could resist the pleasure of such recollections? He, too, had spent so many hours on stream banks; he, too, had felt the tension of a burbot’s mouth around his fingers. But he had used up the best of his stories in his fiction, and he feared the doctor might remember this, and abandon his soliloquies. And then the conversation would no longer be about burbot; it would be about Chekhov. So he was quiet, and lazily drew figures in the sand. The river was deep and wide. When they stopped to picnic, he waded into the water; twice he swam. He tired quickly. The first time, swept away, he had to grasp a pair of drooping willow branches, and collapsed upon the bank. But it was worth it, and a second time, on a very hot afternoon, when Sokolov had drifted off to sleep, and even the doctor had ceased his gabbing, Chekhov rose, and stripped his shirt and trousers and walked into the swift, warm water, and let himself be carried off. Downstream! The river cast a wide arc around the sanatorium. He passed the willow that had saved him and a beach where Voronin and his wife were bathing, her suit lowered over her shoulders, and then another patch of sand where Agafya was washing in the water, her wet blouse clinging to her breasts. He floated past the stables where the horses watered, and the grassy fields before the clinic and the cabins, now so small, so swiftly retreating. From far off, he could hear the snorting of the horses. A herdsman, watering his mare, looked up, and seeing the drifting man, dropped his reins and made to dive in after him, but Chekhov shouted, No! No! Leave me! and he threw his arms back in pleasure to prove that he was well. He drifted, he couldn’t decide whether the sun or the water was more wonderful, the river narrowed, quickened, before it slowed into a deep warm pool. There, children were playing. They stared, but let him be—they understood the current’s joy and didn’t think he needed saving. And he was off again. He rolled like a seal, and dipped his head, and let his feet down, where they dragged through the silty, silky bottom. He hadn’t had such joy from swimming since he had written about it. He was humming “Largo al factotum,” which was odd, because he’d never loved the opera, though it occurred to him that he had never listened to it nearly naked, floating in the sun. It also occurred to him that he might write a story of a man, near death, who rediscovers an unexpected pleasure of his childhood, a taste, a smell, a melody—and he saw the entire plot before him, save the obvious ending, which seemed so trivial and trite. He passed another patch of forest before the river opened fully onto the steppe. For a moment, he felt a wave of vertigo—there was nothing to the left and right but grass, so flat, so uniform. Should he get out? But the warm sun lulled him, and he thought, What if I went this way, until my breath failed me, and let the current decide whether it would pull me under or carry me on? For a long time there was nothing but steppe, and then a single hut appeared. Fearing there might not be another for miles, he paddled to shore, rested, rose, and walked up to the house. A farmer was at home, utterly unfazed by the dripping man who explained, breathlessly, his situation. But the sanatorium wasn’t far—the bends of rivers are deceptive—and when the cart returned him, the doctor and Sokolov were still out fishing. Olga was napping in a chair outside their room, her pink blouse faded to white but for the armpits. When he woke her, she mumbled dopily that she could taste the river on his lips. He didn’t sleep that night. Slowly disentangling himself from his wife, he rose and crossed the room and went out to the veranda and looked across the plain. Cricket song rose from the grasses, from somewhere came the serenade of corncrakes and the distant snorting of a horse awakened from its slumber. His skin had burned that day; it felt as if the sun were still upon him. How wonderfully sore his shoulders were! Yes, it seemed as if he’d stepped into another’s body. He recalled the river’s sway, and Olga’s warm, milk-softened hips as he had moved above her in the dark. And here he had thought himself sick, when really this was all he needed: milk, his wife, a river. Fourteen pounds in but a single month! And if he still coughed blood, still found it ribboning the koumiss when he took it from his lips? It didn’t matter. No, he couldn’t wait until the dawn, he would run into the water, he would float and sing, Olga would come with him, this time they would go for miles, he would write his sister, his mother, his brothers, and beseech them to join him. And together they’d follow him, their heads bobbing, their cheeks kissed by the sun, his brother’s cap floating away, his sister’s dress blooming, his mother’s hair spread out upon the stream. It was then that he realized he was crying. He tried to stop, but once it started, he couldn’t hold it back. For he could see it so clearly then: Olga and his mother and his sister and his brothers, and now even his dead father, and his dead brother, floating, laughing, their bodies tiny in the vastness. Day after exquisite day, July, August, the flowers fading in the heat, the trees beginning to turn, the restless birds, September and the grasses yellowing, and then the winds, the cold wind coming down from the north, the snow, and still they would float, still they would spin, as the river slowed, and the steppe darkened, and the ice gathered in their hair and across their shoulders, until one day, very soon, at an hour indistinguishable from the last and from the one that followed, the floes would seize and the great and sweeping waters would draw slowly to a halt. The following morning, he told Varavka he would be leaving. The doctor seemed not to hear him, and spoke of plans to ride out to a tributary where he’d once caught taimen. “The size of a lamb,” said Varavka. And then: “Two months, it was agreed upon. Think of all your progress.” But his decision had been made. There was no need to draw it out. The other patients knew before he told them; he felt them turn on him. In a stroke, they seemed to age, as if they’d worn the costumes of living people but now were dying once again. In the sun, he saw the hair dye glistening on Voronin’s cheeks. The consul’s wife no longer watched him as she sipped. The cousins came and handed him their address. If he could send a signed photograph? Varavka, at last conceding, planned a goodbye party for Thursday. Wednesday, avoiding Agafya as she repaired the doctor’s fishing nets out by the fountain, Chekhov bribed a porter to call the carriages from town. They slipped away under the cover of night. As they rumbled down the road, the ranks of birches rustled above them. Olga looked at him; he took her hand. He wished to reassure her, to promise other travels, but just then, they heard a shouting and their carriage stopped. The crickets’ song resumed. A horseman drew up to their side. It was Varavka. He was breathless, a coat was thrown over his nightshirt, and he wore sandals on his feet. His face was red. Instantly, Chekhov felt guilty for the deception. He readied an excuse: a crisis in the theater, an illness at home. For the least he could have done was thanked the doctor for his friendship, his stories by the river, the fish! Breathing heavily, Varavka reached inside his coat. Reached like one reaches for a pistol, and his tussled hair and his wild gaze made Chekhov, for a moment, wonder if he had come in vengeance for his wounded pride. Instead, he removed the light-blue linen towel. “You did not sign it!” he said, and jumping down from his horse, laid it over Chekhov’s knees. He had also brought a pen and an inkpot. He pointed to a spot beneath the signature of Natalia Stepanova, the opera singer. The towel took the ink up greedily. Chekhov had to dip the pen three times. When he finished, Varavka held the towel to the moonlight. How excellent, he said approvingly—yes, he would have it embroidered straight away! “And you will send a photo, also, won’t you? We will hang it in the hall!” And then with a swiftness that belied his size, he heaved himself back on the horse, touched his hand to his heart, once, twice, and with a kick rode back into the night.

        "story": "Try, start here, try bringing a pot of coffee out into the sun in despite of the hot weather, and sit at your chair and table ready for all possible assimilations. Include with the coffee something slightly intensely sweet: not slightly sweet but slightly intensely, since all intensities only need to be slight at this point. Sit and drink the coffee and eat the chocolate, and here is the thing: stop making the mistake of trying to show other people that furthermost corner of yourself, it is good for one thing only, walk calmly over and ask them for it back. Remember, for instance, that telling people you are reading Tolkien late at night fatally alters the chemical composition of doing this. Also, stop celebrating. Or, qualifying that a little, remember that celebrating can also be very privately sitting drinking your coffee on a sunny morning, watching people go past in the street and reading a book you may not finish. Yes you have been blessed and baffled with success lately, and also god yes there is the ferocity of having a new lover, but what about behaving as if none of these things were relevant to your own strict project? Sometimes accuracy must take the place of expansiveness. So leaving all these things not where you can see them but all right where you can just about feel the light-brown confidence of them, take yourself off into another room. They must not be useful even to cast your thoughts towards in moments of hesitation. Instead the finger of the mind must be poised to run down a skirt of dusky-pink satin, or over a white tablecloth embroidered in blackwork, or yes must curve and thrill at the strong coffee drunk outside in the sun. Or picture a gorge worn in English limestone, grassy at the top and then rocky as it winds downhill, with moss and trees and water bubbling: this entirely meaningless place get you there and gaze. This is what is so difficult to learn, to stop talking, stop anticipating, stop being vigilant in your ancient unnecessary way. The time as it passes isn’t it cool, and exquisitely textured like linen? What else? Rather than announcing various refusals in the name of your own well-being, you would do better to find things to say yes to. Sometimes do make yourself tremble by agreeing to everything that is suggested, tremble at everything you yourself have the potential to do. Then you can reinstall the proper curtains which divide the possible from the actually impossible, and perhaps choose a new pattern or style for them or insert additional pleats where there were no pleats—though all the same, remember you are not designing a hotel, you will have to live here. Likewise it is almost certain that neither aubergine roasted with harissa, nor a navy T-shirt bought for three pounds from Oxfam, nor a book about the history of Baghdad, will entirely solve the problem because the problem exists elsewhere, as if in flowing water while you are sitting on the bank. Dip a hand in, would be one possibility, and feel how water is unattached to any of these bought and sold objects, how water wishes most of all to collapse into itself yet depends on its own surface tension to resist this until the very end. Or you could notice how your lover’s skin requires no accoutrements to be warm and lightly haired, or how the pleasure of their fingertips on your lower back loops and bunches and builds until the word pleasure ceases to make sense, like a bursting of the idea of pleasure in fact, into smithereens. Afterwards, yes, you can sit up in bed and read Walt Whitman while they sleep. Then going into the office the next morning you can take an unreligious but still fairly pious joy in the answering of emails and the making of phone calls, because there is a satisfaction here that can be trickled out like sand, and because you can feel how each of those other realms is kept steady and will wait for you to come back. Try taking on the buttoned-up calm of someone who has pledged their life to a service and forbidden themselves from ever doubting their choice. So what if—all that? One day you will find a cotton sundress that fits you beautifully, it cannot be doubted. In the meantime you have a committee to circulate papers for, and you must adjudicate on your team’s annual leave, and your boss is relying on you to keep at bay someone who has been trying to get a meeting for weeks. Indeed there is a certain benefit in having a boss: someone you can serve without having to be grateful to them: which is a restful and low-risk experiment in true submission, and which also explains the ubiquitous narrative gesture consisting of the sudden command Turn around, the wordless lifting of the skirt, the being bent forwards over the varnished mahogany desk, and so on. The fantasy of comprehensiveness, is the thing, that the remit of the boss could be infinitely enlarged across your whole life. Remember, though, that like most people you would only wish to serve someone who wanted from you the things you already want from yourself: so, what would be the point? Whatever you may wishfully think, you do not need to be enforced to be effectual. Honestly your power of forgetting all these things or at least of living as if you didn’t know them is quite impressive. You are in the running to become a campus perpetual, the amount of time you luxuriously spend there drinking tea with friends in the shade outside the café, modeling for others the long-form delight of having finished a Ph.D. The class of campus perpetuals is not a bad one to belong to, they like you there, they ought to, you’ve hung around now for years—but perhaps it is like drinking only the water vapor which rises from the earth, rather than water in the form of actual water. At least (if you can be persuaded of one thing) take to heart that summer is nearly over, there is a tide of knitwear and teacakes making its way towards you, and you had better make sure you can still think and read and write in complete paragraphs, since that is or at least ought to be the cooling effect of autumn. On the other hand, your problem is that you often keep your present too sharply angled towards the future: one success and you are writhing with it, as if all is coming. Remember, for instance, that wearing mascara is always an invitation for the mascara to run. And indeed stop trying to be the clear cool voice of truth, however compassionate like rain. (Yes, we are finally having rain after a long drought.) You have only one person’s capacity for life, and things run over by the tongue always feel bigger than they really are. There are different schools of thought on whether it would be a waste of a day just to sit watching the rain. But whatever the conclusion, try to refrain from enthusing in anything other than the narrowest most central part of yourself—and there enthuse day and night, ignore sleep, enthusiasm is a project which cannot rest. Reverence the rain as something we have all needed, including you, and summer rain above all as the blessing no one is able to bestow on themselves or anyone else. And remember how you and your friend once sat under the awning of the café while it rained and rained, and were treated with special friendliness by the staff, partly (let us assume) because it was raining and you were nonetheless choosing to sit there and buy things, but also seemingly because they liked you both, they enjoyed the air of playful discussion you gave off, the two of you drew people in with your obvious chemistry and affection, and from that alone you can deduce (what you know already) that such friendships are rare like whales, you could travel your whole ocean life and never encounter one. What you want—now we come to it—is style that comes from a very full and considered embrace of everything, except the idea of evil, which you must not credit. The world is wonderfully everything that is wonderfully the case, something like that. But a warning: the more you are like this, the younger people will think you are, because it is considered abnormal to plunge with an absolutely cheerful and fixated eye. The more you are like this, the better you will write and the worse you will dress. One thing you might experiment with further is lending out certain permissions of yourself. Did not your friend say a few months ago, Fill some notebooks, and have you not been slowly putting this into practice and finding it gratifying? Your notebooks are filling! with thoughts that sometimes are clean and sparkling, and other times burrowing and twisting like fox tunnels in the earth. So perhaps allow another friend to decide whether you should have a beer with lunch, or to press a book on you which you will actually undertake to read, or to choose the color you will paint your bathroom. Allow your timetable to be gently pulled out of shape or wiped blank, as a way of allowing yourself to be gently pulled out of shape or even wiped blank. Spend a day with your lover in which there are no plans, in fact come to treat the idea of plans with deep suspicion, as if irreversibly corrupted: not always, just sometimes. You need time to notice that the grass is a little greener again and the trees a little fuller after yesterday’s rain, this is the second half of the joy of rain which has its own unquestionable structure, a better structure indeed for deciding how to fill time—fill time, what a notion—than the making of actual plans. What is this rule you’ve absorbed that you are not allowed to lie on your bed reading a book in the middle of the day? You cannot be serious. What else, then? It seems you do at least understand that there is no point in trying to do too much, and the main thing now is making sure you don’t do too little. The slack in the line should only be very slight, perceptible more to you than to anyone else. Or perhaps what you must convey is that if your time appears like a dress cut quite loosely, with room to move, that is its deliberate cut, it’s not that you have bought the wrong size. Or your time is a lawn, requiring nightly watering to produce its densest lushest green, though of course you must be wary of any metaphor that depends on a monoculture. Or your time is a paragraph, which whatever it does in the middle must have its beginnings and ends placed quite carefully. So now returning to the question of how to celebrate, tend towards austerity. You adore the sitting praying, the obedient getting up early, you cannot forget the solemn hymn tune in its ancient minor mode. Last night you woke your lover up to cry, that is all right, but in the morning you must quietly say goodbye to them and go to your desk. And there anything can be extended or pressed down on itself or pleasurably kneaded, anything. Take your copy of one of the lesser-known plays, perhaps All’s Well That Ends Well, and read it carefully with attention to each obscure phrase, solving one Shakespearean problem after another. Or else go to the world, by which Shakespeare means, get married. And armed with these techniques and precepts you will be able to think, my god, every time I sit down to write I might discover anything at all. Remember that your whole life is like a diary of life, indexed to various long novels you have read and various cups of coffee you have drunk with friends. Some of this must be kept: be patient: there is never any rush. Soon, soon it will be time once again for Henry James, and his paragraphs each one like a new civilization: autumn is coming: which is to say, all.

        "story": "There is someone in the house. Heard as he moves around the room upstairs. When he gets out of bed or when he goes down the stairs and into the kitchen. There’s the gush of water through the pipes when he fills a kettle. The sound of metal on metal when he sets the kettle on the stove and the very faint click when he turns on the gas. Then there’s a pause until the water comes to a boil. There’s the rustle of tea leaves and paper as first one, then another spoonful of tea leaves is taken from a paper bag and poured into the teapot, then the sound of water being poured over the tea leaves, but such sounds can be heard only in the kitchen. I can hear the fridge being opened, because the door bumps against a corner of the countertop. Then there’s another pause, while the tea steeps, and in a moment I’ll hear the chink of a cup and saucer being taken from the cupboard. I don’t hear the sound of the tea being poured into the cup, but I can hear footsteps moving from the kitchen to the living room as he carries the cup of tea through the house. His name is Thomas Selter. The house is a two-story stone cottage on the outskirts of the town of Clairon-sous-Bois in northern France. No one enters the back room overlooking the garden and the woodpile. It is the eighteenth of November. I have got used to that thought. I have got used to the sounds, to the gray morning light and to the rain that will soon start to fall in the garden. I have got used to footsteps on the floor and doors being opened and closed. I can hear Thomas going from the living room to the kitchen and putting the cup down on the countertop and before long I hear him in the hall. I hear him take his coat from its peg and I hear him drop his umbrella on the floor and pick it up. Once Thomas has gone out into the November rain, there is silence in the house. Broken only by my own sounds and the soft patter of rain outside. There is the scratch of pencil on paper and the scrape of the chair on the floor when I push it back and get up from the table. There are the sounds of my footsteps as I cross the room and the very slight creak of the door handle when I open the door into the hall. While Thomas is out, I usually wander around the house. I go to the toilet, get water from the kitchen, but I soon go back to the room. I close the door and sit down on the bed or the chair in the corner, so I won’t be seen from the garden path should anyone look in. When Thomas returns carrying two thin plastic bags, the sounds start up again. The key in the door and shoes being wiped on the mat. The crinkle of the plastic bags when he sets down his shopping. The sound of the rolled umbrella, which he lays on the chair in the hall, and a moment later that of his coat being hung on the rack by the door. I hear the repeated crinkle of plastic as he places his shopping bags on the countertop and puts things away. He puts cheese in the fridge, pops two cans of tomatoes into a cupboard, and leaves a bar of chocolate on the countertop. When the bags are empty, he balls them up and stows them in the cupboard under the sink. Then he closes the door and leaves them to carry on crinkling in there. During the day I hear him in the office upstairs. I hear a swivel chair rolling across the floor and the printer churning out labels and letters. I hear footsteps on the stairs and the gentle thud on the floorboards as Thomas sets down packages and letters in the hall. I hear him in the kitchen and the living room. I hear the sound of a hand or a sleeve brushing the wall as he goes back upstairs, I hear him in the bathroom and I hear a sound from the toilet that can only be made by a man peeing standing upright. Presently I hear him on the stairs and in the hall again, then he goes into the living room and sits down in an armchair by the window facing the road. And there he waits, reading and watching the November rain. He is waiting for me. My name is Tara Selter. I am sitting in the back room overlooking the garden and the woodpile. It is the eighteenth of November. Every night, when I lie down to sleep in the bed in the guest room, it is the eighteenth of November and every morning, when I wake up, it is the eighteenth of November. I no longer expect to wake up to the nineteenth of November and I no longer remember the seventeenth of November as if it were yesterday. I open the window and throw out some bread for the birds that will soon be gathering in the garden. They show up when there is a break in the rain. First the blackbirds, who peck at the last apples on the apple tree or the bread I’ve thrown out, and then a lone robin. Moments later a long-tailed tit flies down, closely followed by some great tits who are promptly seen off by the blackbirds. Shortly afterward the rain comes on again. The blackbirds carry on feeding for a little while longer, but when the rain gets heavier they fly off to take shelter in the hedge. Thomas has lit a fire in the living room. He has brought in wood from the garden shed, and I soon start to feel the house growing warmer. I heard the sounds from the hall and the living room, but now that Thomas is sitting with his reading, all I can hear is my pencil on the paper, a whisper soon eclipsed by the sound of the rain. I have counted the days and, if my calculations are correct, today is November18, No.121. I keep track of the days. I keep track of the sounds in the house. When it is quiet I do nothing. I lie down and rest on the bed or I read a book, but I make no sound. Or hardly any. I breathe. I get up and tiptoe about the room. The sounds carry me around. I sit on the bed or gently pull the chair out from the table by the window. In the middle of the afternoon, Thomas puts on some music in the living room. First I hear him in the hall and the kitchen. I hear him putting a kettle on the stove, hear his footsteps on the floor as he goes back through to the living room and puts on the music. Then I know it will soon clear up. The clouds will pass and there will be a glimmer of sunshine. I usually get ready to go out as soon as the music starts. I get up and put on my coat and my boots. I stand by the door for a few moments until the music is so loud that I can leave the house without being heard, the strains issuing from the living room masking the sound of doors being opened, of footsteps on the floor and doors being closed. I leave the house by the garden door. I slip my bag over my shoulder, softly open the guest-room door, step into the hall and close it behind me. On the floor are three medium-size envelopes and four brown cardboard packages with our name on them: T.&T.Selter. That’s us. We deal in antiquarian books, specializing in illustrated works from the eighteenth century. We buy the books at auction, from private collectors or other booksellers and then sell them on, sending them off in brown packages bearing our name. I slip silently past the packages on the floor, open the door, and step outside. I don’t need an umbrella. It is still raining slightly, but it won’t be long before it stops completely. I don’t take the garden path leading up to the gate, instead I turn left and go around the side of the house, past the shed and down to a corner of the garden that can’t be seen from the house. I pass a plot of leeks and two rows of Swiss chard and come to a gap in the fence, which brings me out onto the road. I glance back briefly. I see a thin trail of smoke coiling up from the chimney, hear the very faint sound of music, but I hurry on. A few steps further and I can hear neither music nor rain because the rain has stopped, the music has been left behind me, and the only sounds are my footsteps on the sidewalk, the rumble of a few cars and the distant voices of children at a school some blocks away. Not long afterward, when Thomas sees that the rain has stopped, he turns off the music. He puts on his coat and picks up the pile of letters and packages from the hall floor. He leaves the house at 3:24. Carrying letters and packages. T.&T.Selter. That’s us. But time has come between us. We walk along the narrow roads into town or back to the house. We are outside, we walk around in a break in the rain, but we do not take the same roads. He does not expect to meet me along the way, nor will he. I know another route, and by the time he returns to the house I am back in the room looking out on the garden. If there is anything I need, I buy it in a small supermarket a few blocks away. I allow plenty of time and usually take a roundabout way home. I come through the gate and up the garden path to the back door and let myself in. The house is quiet. Thomas is out and it is no longer raining. He is on his way into town and by the time he has dropped off his packages the sun will have broken through. He will take a walk through the woods and down to the river and won’t return until late in the afternoon, after the rain has started again, because there is no one waiting for him in the house and there is nothing he has to do. Usually, when I return, I leave my shopping bags in the guest room. I hang my coat over the back of the chair, I take off my boots and go through to the kitchen. There’s a cup next to the sink and the kettle on the stove is still slightly warm. I can follow Thomas’s tracks through the house. I go upstairs and into the office. There are piles of books on the desk and a scattering of papers. There are books on the shelves and in boxes on the floor. One of the boxes is open because Thomas has been searching through it for something and hasn’t closed it again. In the bedroom next door to the office, it looks as if someone has just got up, but only one side of the bed has been slept on.  I have an hour and a half in the house before Thomas gets back. I have time to have a bath or wash some clothes in the sink, I have time to take a book from the shelf and sit down with it in one of the armchairs by the window. If I spend the time in the living room, I usually listen to music or read until it starts to get dark, but today I am staying in here, in the room overlooking the garden and the woodpile. I heard Thomas take his coat off the peg and I heard him leave the house. I opened the door into the hall, the packages are gone from the floor, and now I am sitting at the table by the window. It is the eighteenth of November. I am becoming used to that thought. On the morning of the seventeenth of November, I said goodbye to Thomas at the door of the house. The time was a quarter to eight, the taxi was waiting outside, and I caught the 8:17 train from Clairon-sous-Bois. I was going to Bordeaux for the annual auction of illustrated works from the eighteenth century. The sky was gray, there was moisture in the air, but it didn’t come to rain. From Clairon station I traveled to Lille-Flandres, switched to Lille-Europe, and went from there to Paris, where I changed trains for Bordeaux. I got to the station in Bordeaux just before two o’clock and after a moment’s confusion due to road work outside the station, with lots of barriers, signs, and closed walkways, I found my way to the exhibition center where the auction was to be held, arriving there a few minutes later. I registered and was given a program and a badge, which read 7ème salon lumières, followed by my name and, below that, our company name, T.&T.Selter. I was in good time for the main auction of illustrated books, which was due to start at three o’clock. A couple of auctions had already been held, and I could see from the program that again this year there would be talks and panel discussions, but none that I was planning to attend. Once inside, I faltered for a moment, slightly disoriented by a scene that spoke of a conference in progress, all closed doors and abandoned coffee cups, until I spotted the signs and arrows pointing to the auction room and the adjoining exhibition hall, where scores of antiquarian booksellers had, as always, set up their stands displaying books and scientific illustrations. I had a fairly good idea of which books I wanted to bid for in the auction, and once I had taken a look at the most important of these, I did a round of the exhibition hall. I said hello to some booksellers I knew from before, and then, at a few minutes to three, I took my seat in the auction hall, which soon began to fill with people streaming out of the conference rooms. I managed to buy twelve works at the auction. Five for which we had already had requests and seven others for which I thought we could get decent prices. We deal mainly in moderately priced books and sell to a mixed bunch of collectors, most of them in Europe, although we do have a few customers in other parts of the world. As a rule, I am the one who travels to auctions and visits antiquarian bookshops while Thomas takes care of cataloguing and shipping. To begin with we did everything together, but we have gradually split the responsibilities between us. I’m not sure why it fell to me to do the traveling. Maybe because I don’t mind traveling so much and maybe because I very quickly developed a certain instinct for the books, a feel for the paper, an eye for the quality of the printing, for a well-crafted binding. I don’t know what it is, but it’s almost physical, like an inchworm testing whether a leaf is worth creeping across, or a bird listening to insects moving in the bark of a tree. It might be a detail: the sound when you flick through the pages, the feel of the lettering, the depth of the imprint, the saturation of the colors in an illustration, the precision of the details in a plate, the hues of the edges, I don’t know what it is that seals it for me, because even though I generally know which works I’m interested in, usually I’m not absolutely sure whether I want to buy a book until I have it in my hand. After the auction, I went back to the exhibition hall, paid for some books I had had put aside, and found another six works that I had been looking for, as well as a few I hadn’t known about. I usually arrange for the heaviest and most valuable books to be sent straight to Clairon-sous-Bois, but I often take a few of my purchases away with me in my bag: on this occasion, a pocket encyclopedia of birdcalls arranged by note, new to me; a second edition of Harcard’s book on the anatomy of animals; and a fine copy of Boisot’s renowned book on spiders, Atlas des Araignées, which one of our regular customers wished to give as a present to a friend and which we had therefore promised to look out for. Late in the afternoon on the seventeenth of November, I boarded the train to Paris and arrived late that evening at the Hôtel du Lison, where we usually stay when we’re in town. The Hôtel du Lison sits on the corner of the Rue Almageste, where several of the antiquarian booksellers with whom we deal have their shops and where our good friend Philip Maurel has his antique coin shop. My plan for the next two days, apart from buying books for our business and seeing Philip, was to visit the research library Bibliothèque18, in Clichy, where I had an appointment the following day, the nineteenth of November, with a librarian by the name of Nami Charet, who had written an article on some hitherto overlooked variations on eighteenth-century printing techniques. Her discovery of certain changes to engravers’ tools and working methods had made it possible to date illustrations from the end of that period with great accuracy, thereby shedding light on discrepancies between their genesis and year of publication. Once at the hotel, I called Thomas. It wasn’t a long conversation. I told him about the day’s finds and asked him if he had any titles to add to my list for the next day. He had come up with a couple of works that he thought would be worth looking for, and he had also just arranged with two of our fellow dealers in the Rue Renart, a side street off the Rue Almageste, to have a couple of books set aside. He asked me to examine them and to buy them if they were in decent condition. I added these titles to my list and promised to go take a look at them. I think we chatted a little more about the auction and a bit about the November weather before we said our good nights and hung up. We try to avoid long phone calls when we’re apart. Not only because otherwise we would just end up having long, detailed dialogues on the condition of the books, publication years, the illustrations, and the pricing, but also because such conversations seem to increase the distance between us. The minute we deviate from simple, practical matters, the conversation lapses imperceptibly into a kind of audio link, a muted love mumble. Our communication, initially meaningful and coherent, turns into a series of fitful exchanges containing neither sentences nor information: little words and sounds meant—I suppose—to keep the line between us open, but that, instead, make all too clear how far apart we are. So we have learned to split the work between us, stick to practical matters, and speak to each other only when necessary. I’ve forgotten many of the details of our conversation, but Thomas—who remembers the seventeenth of November as if it were yesterday—has told me that I had spoken in glowing terms of my day’s haul and that I had been wondering whether T.&T.Selter should expand its operations to include scientific plates and illustrations. We talked mostly about the practical problems associated with my suggestion, particularly regarding shipping, which would probably be Thomas’s job. I felt the idea was worth considering, but Thomas was not so sure. I don’t recall the rest of the conversation, but I do remember that shortly afterward I had a bath and then I settled myself on the bed in my hotel room and ran an eye over my book list. I also remember that I was quite tired from all the traveling, that I set the alarm on my phone, got undressed, and climbed into bed. I still don’t know whether it would be a good idea for T. & T. Selter to expand into plates and illustrations, but I do know that such considerations no longer have any meaning. I know too that Thomas left his packages at the post office a while ago, that he has been down by the river and past the old water mill, and that he has walked through the woods and will soon be back. I keep an eye on the rain clouds. The clouds tell me when time is up. The light fades, and I see the sky change to dark gray. If I’m sitting in the living room with a book, it grows too dark for me to read and I prepare to retreat to the guest room. I sit for a moment listening to the rain and, when it intensifies, I know that Thomas will soon be back. I get up from the armchair by the window. I go to the kitchen, rinse my cup in the sink, put it in the cupboard, and come into the guest room. I usually remember to turn the heat up before I leave the living room. The embers in the grate have long gone cold, and when Thomas gets back he’ll be drenched. But I am not sitting in the living room today. I am sitting at the table in the guest room and the rain clouds are gathering once more. I gaze out at the garden and the apple tree. A couple of apples have fallen onto the grass, a light breeze has blown the autumn leaves almost dry while I’ve been sitting here, but the tree will soon be wet with rain again. I can still see the birds when they dart about in the faint light. They can tell that rain is on the way, but they haven’t yet gone to roost in the hedge. Darkness falls as I wait for Thomas to go by outside. The writing on the page in front of me becomes hard to read. I’ve shut the door to the hall and moved away from the window. I usually sit on the bed while I wait for Thomas to get back, and I know that first one and then another dark shadow will come along the road at the bottom of the garden. The first shadow is our neighbor. The second is Thomas making his way through the rain. This is the only time I see him: a wet silhouette down by the fence. The rest of the day he is just sounds in the rooms of the house. Not until Thomas has once again become sounds in the rooms of the house do I turn on a light. I heard his footsteps on the garden path, his key in the lock, and the door being opened and closed. I heard him wipe his feet on the mat and the faint click of the switch when he turned on the hall light. I can see light filtering in under the door, and I have turned on the lamp on the table. My light fills this room and filters out under the door, but it cannot be seen from the hall, mingling as it does to invisibility with the light out there. I have moved back to the table by the window, and before long I hear Thomas’s feet on the stairs and in the passage again. I hear him in the kitchen and the hall. I hear him open the door facing the road and go out to fetch a leek from the garden and some onions from the shed. I can hear him pulling on the pair of rubber boots by the door. I can hear him walking down the side of the house, and then nothing until he returns with his vegetables. I hear him chopping vegetables for soup. Hear the rattle of the pot on the stove and, once the soup is ready, the scrape of chair legs on the kitchen floor. A little later, I hear the gush of water through the pipes as Thomas washes his plate in the kitchen sink, then I hear him putting the plate back in the cupboard before going to the living room. He spends his evening reading Jocelyn Miron’s Lucid Investigations, and it’s almost midnight before he switches off the hall light and goes upstairs, but that is a while off yet, the evening is just beginning. Thomas is getting changed in the bedroom above, and I am remembering a long succession of November days that have begun to run together in my mind. There are 121 days to remember. If I can. To begin with, the eighteenth of November was in no way unusual. I woke up in my hotel room at 7:30 and went down for breakfast half an hour later. I spent the day visiting various antiquarian bookshops in the area around Rue Almageste, calling in along the way at Philip Maurel’s shop at No.31. Philip’s new assistant, whom I had not met before, thought he would be back toward the end of the afternoon, so I said I would pop in again around five o’clock. At the different bookshops where we normally buy things when we are in town, I found a number of the works I was looking for. I stopped in at one dealer’s in the Rue Renart to look at the copy of Histoire des eaux potables that Thomas had found for sale and that one of our customers had made numerous inquiries about. It was a very nice copy, so I bought it on the spot and put it in my bag, to be taken back with me to Clairon-sous-Bois the very next day for Thomas to forward to our impatient client. At the same dealer’s, I found a couple of other works, which I bought and asked to be sent to Clairon, and in another I picked up a copy of Thornton’s Heavenly Bodies in good condition and containing two plates included only in this one edition, published in two small printings in 1767. Just before five o’clock, I descended the steps to Philip Maurel’s shop again. It had been a while since I had seen him, six months, maybe more, and we sat for a while chatting at the big desk in the front of the shop, with Philip getting up every now and again to serve a customer or to answer the phone. I told him about the house in Clairon-sous-Bois, which he hasn’t yet visited, although we’ve been there for a couple of years now. I spoke about love, about the apple tree in the garden, about leeks and Swiss chard. I told him about the autumn floods, about the river that occasionally overflows its banks, and about our business, from which we were at last able to make a living, about the growing demand for illustrated works from the eighteenth century, about the auction and my latest finds. Philip told me about life on the Rue Almageste and his new girlfriend, Marie, whom I had met in the shop earlier that day, about the political unrest that autumn, about the high demand for rare and not-so-rare relics of the past—a trend he had also observed in his own business. Philip specializes in coins from imperial Rome, a business that, when he first set up shop as a very young man, most of his friends regarded as a bit of a joke, but which in recent years has proved to be a lucrative concern. He told me in wonder how, on several occasions, he had been invited to dinner by one of his regular customers only to find himself at the center of an interested crowd consisting not only of elderly gentlemen, but also of younger men and women, all eager to hear about imperial mint regulations, the details of coin-pressing techniques, or about somewhat suspect Belarusian coin discoveries. He spoke of hosts who would suddenly whisk visitors off through their vast Parisian apartments to show off a coin collection, not to the surprise or embarrassment of their guests at their host’s weird hobby, but to their delight, studying their host’s latest acquisitions intently through powerful magnifying glasses. Philip confessed that he had been rather surprised to see his own quiet passion receiving so much attention. These small metal tokens from a bygone age had apparently become the subject of a new collecting mania—not exactly a wave, perhaps, but certainly a growing interest, of which he was keenly aware, in his business. We reflected a little on this demand for trophies from the past, and I showed Philip my copy of Histoire des eaux potables. We talked about how keen the buyer had been to get hold of it and wondered why someone would want to buy a book like this. Who buys an over-two-hundred-year-old book on the history of drinking water? A collector of some sort, but what exactly his collection consisted of and how the book was to figure in it was hard to guess. I knew nothing about him except his name, his address, and the sound of his voice on the phone when he had called for the third time, a few weeks earlier, to inquire about the book. I assumed him to be a middle-aged man, and I knew that he had purchased two or three other books from us before, although I couldn’t remember which ones. I still remember how we discussed with a certain irony and detachment this burgeoning interest in the treasures of the past. Although we too could be said to suffer from this same nostalgia or hunger for history or whatever you want to call it, we were both slightly surprised that it was becoming more widespread. I think we almost felt the urge to apologize for our strange interests, which we now evidently shared with more and more people. Well, at least we had managed to make a living out of them. They were our businesses, not a hobby or a fleeting fad. We had our companies, T.&T.Selter and Maurel Numismatique, to manage, and we felt, I suppose, that we had a somewhat more pragmatic relationship with our inner nostalgist than our customers. Fortunately, Marie turned up in the middle of this conversation. Philip introduced us, we exchanged a few words about the current conversation and also about our having met each other earlier in the day. After a little while, Marie pulled up a chair and sat down at the counter while Philip went out to pick up some food and a couple of bottles of wine from a nearby shop. It was one of the first cold November evenings. There had been a rain shower in the morning, the rest of the day had been cloudy with the occasional sunny spell, and it was starting to feel quite chilly in the shop. In the little kitchen at the back, where Philip had also slept for the first years after opening the shop, he had an old gas heater, which Marie and I decided to try to light. Marie wiped a layer of dust off the top and together we managed to maneuver the large blue gas cylinder sitting next to it into the back of the heater, attach it, and push the heavy appliance through to the front of the shop and over to the counter. We found a box of matches in a kitchen drawer and lit the gas. By the time Philip got back, the shop was warming up nicely. We sat around the counter and spent the next few hours eating, drinking, and talking. What I remember most clearly from that evening is how much I enjoyed sitting there between Philip and Marie. They had a closeness I could not help but notice. Not the sort of unspoken awareness that shuts other people out, the self-absorption of a couple, in the first throes of love, who need constantly to make contact by look or touch, or the fragile intimacy that makes an outsider feel like a disruptive element and gives you the urge to simply leave the lovers alone with their delicate alliance. They had an air of peace about them, Marie and Philip, which reminded me of the time, five years ago, when I first met Thomas. The sudden feeling of sharing something inexplicable, a sense of wonder at the existence of the other—the one person who makes everything simple—a feeling of being calmed down and thrown into turmoil at the same time. Philip and Marie had clearly decided to spend the rest of their lives together, it was as simple as that, so what could they do but see what the future would bring. Seen in that light, my visit was a perfectly normal occurrence, I was an ingredient in their life together, a colleague of sorts and a friend, married to one of Philip’s friends from his early teens. I was not in the way, I was neither a help nor a hindrance, neither an opponent nor a supporter, neither a buyer nor a seller; I was simply a fact in their lives. I no longer remember the details of the evening’s conversation, but I remember the atmosphere in the room. I remember at one point sitting there, studying a corner of the big old oak desk we were sitting around, which functioned as the shop’s counter. I remember the marks in the wood and a little display of coins in transparent boxes, which we had to push to one side to make space for the plates and glasses. I also remember the warmth of the room and my accident with the gas heater. It happened some time after we had finished eating. I had pushed my chair back a bit, but the heat was almost overpowering, so I got up to move the heater a little farther away. I remember Philip had picked up our plates and gone out to the little kitchen at the back of the shop for a corkscrew to open another bottle of wine, and I remember saying something about how hot it was and that I would just move the heater slightly. Marie got up, but I had already placed a hand on its upper edge and given it a firm push away from the desk. While we’d been sitting there, the heater had, of course, become red-hot, and the metal edge on which I had laid my hand was scorching, so just as the heavy appliance started to shift, I felt a sudden, searing pain in my hand. I let out a cry, an expletive probably. Marie came over and managed to move the heater while I stood there, paralyzed for a moment by the pain. Having deposited our plates in the kitchen, Philip promptly reappeared with a bowl of cold water into which I plunged my hand, and for the rest of the evening I sat like that, with my hand immersed in a bowl of water, although this did nothing to ease the pain. That was the only unusual thing to happen that night. I got back to the hotel just before eleven o’clock and shortly after that I called Thomas. He had been engrossed in Jocelyn Miron’s book and sounded as though he hadn’t been expecting me to call. I don’t know whether I had disturbed his reading or whether he was glad of the interruption, but I remember how he filled me in on the central themes of the book and explained the different forms of Enlightenment thinking outlined by Miron. I remember too that we discussed the book’s rather odd subtitle, “Rises and Falls of Enlightenment Projects,” and then I told him about my visit to Philip Maurel, about his girlfriend, Marie, and their obvious love for each other, about the growing demand for Roman coins and my accident with the heater in Philip’s shop. Thomas told me that it had rained for most of the day, apart from a break of a few hours in the afternoon. He had taken letters and packages to the post office and later, when the sun had broken through, he had decided to take a walk through the woods and along the river. He had gone as far as the old water mill, thinking that the rain had passed, but on the way home he had been caught in a heavy shower and got absolutely drenched. I remember how we talked about the risk of the river overflowing. He had said that, judging by the height of the water, if the weather forecast for the next few days held good then the danger of flooding was over for now. I don’t recall all the details of our conversation, but I’m sure I reported on the day’s finds, on prices and delivery arrangements, and I know we discussed my plans for the following day, the nineteenth, when I was due to meet Nami Charet at Bibliothèque 18. Once or twice during our conversation, I complained about the still-painful burn on my hand and we had a little laugh at my thoughtlessness: it wasn’t the first time I had come to grief for not heeding, as Thomas put it, the basic principles of cause and effect. He suggested I get some ice cubes to cool the wound, and then we probably exchanged a few inconsequential remarks. I remember one of us observing that we were slipping back into our old familiar audio-link mode, murmurings that accentuated the distance between us, and before we said good night a couple of times and hung up I think I promised Thomas I would go straight down to the hotel lobby for some ice cubes. That was the last time I spoke to Thomas before time fell apart. I lay awake for a while, half an hour, maybe longer. I had got hold of a bag of ice cubes, laid the ice on the burn, and wrapped a towel around my hand. The pain and the cold kept me awake, and I tossed and turned a bit, feeling strangely restless in bed, but gradually the chilling effect or the tiredness or whatever it was caused the pain to recede and when I eventually fell asleep it was with a towel full of melting ice cubes around my hand and a small stack of books on the desk in the room: some notes on birdcalls, an atlas of spiders, a book on heavenly bodies, a work on the history of drinking water, and an encyclopedia of animal anatomy. On a chair next to the bed lay my phone, with the alarm set for 7:30 the next morning. Over the back of the chair hung a dress, a sweater, and a pair of tights, and on the floor were a pair of ankle boots and a large shoulder bag containing an extra dress, tights, underwear, a purse, a bunch of keys, an almost-empty water bottle, and a rolled-up umbrella. I still have the bag beside me on the floor and the books are on the table next to the spare bed. I am no longer in the hotel, but in our house in Clairon-sous-Bois, in the room overlooking the garden. It is evening and it is still the eighteenth of November. Thomas is in the living room, reading, and soon he will switch off the light and check that the doors are locked. He will go upstairs and when he wakes up tomorrow morning his eighteenth of November will have been forgotten. This is the 121st time I have lived through the eighteenth of November, and the burn is still visible as a slender scar on my hand. It started out as an angry, puffy weal. This soon began to weep, then a long, brownish scab formed over it. Little by little the scab loosened and fell off, leaving a shiny pink mark. It can no longer be felt and, in a moment, when I turn the light off, it will no longer be seen.

        "story": "I did trip over a small boy who fell down and cried, and I feared very much that I had kicked him. He must have been wondering about the monster—me—even after his rescue. But whose glass was I holding? And which bitter drink had I just tasted when Mother said, “Damn it all!”—and laughed? My mother rarely laughs in my presence. “I want my wife!” I shouted. I surprised myself. “We’re leaving!” She was back behind the Wassermans and the Cordells, and that little boy I’d knocked down was with them, too, speaking softly. His mother had to bend quite low to listen—his legs, I figured, were no more than a foot long. First, we had to dodge so many people. I was, however, bound by the low ceiling in Mother’s house, and I feel like a giant in her house. I heard my wife, Jacquenette, say to Dale Cordell, “All right, then,” and this was jarring, because she often says that just before bed, where I can grab her, for starters, and then clamp down. But I don’t really mean clamp down—I mean something much nicer. In bed, my feet found hers, and she said my hand was too heavy and that it hurt her hand to hold mine, so she petted my arm, and I thought that that might serve me. But I want to try again soon to get a better result, when I’ll go rung by rung to different stages. Too early the next evening, Jacquenette looked to be asleep in bed. “Did I disturb you?” I said, and I advanced with care. The buffeting noise—perhaps it was a flight of birds I heard through the open window—distracted me. And yet I did set everything into motion by doing some light tapping on her body that did not cost me anything—my brushless style. My thoughts were: What do you feel if I do this? If I do this? If I do this? Still, what about my wife’s face? Its shining surface would repay me for my efforts. You know, I’d much rather note scenes of everyday life around the house—speaking to neighbors, dusting. Odd thing—our oatmeal took twice as long as usual to cook this morning. I don’t think it liked the pot. i liked rex I had just met Devin Stamp!—and I would have liked to hold on longer to our promising, necessary bond, but I was visiting him for only two days—during which time I was often blushing. It was as if tiny lights were continuously being switched on when I got off the train to go home, because dandelions lined the sidewalks, and these weeds blinked at me. An envelope was waiting for me at home, addressed in a familiar hand—from Rex! Oh, I want to have plenty of reasons to believe in activities that are stimulative. I remembered when his big head was above mine, my ear on his warm chest. Rex Pickens wrote: I have heard that you are lonely. I need to tell you something that cannot be said in a letter. When we met up, Rex looked to me brightly painted. He wore a heavy wool suit I’d never seen before—glen plaid, a houndstooth check—and next, in bed, I thought his very pink privates were meant to be some cheery dessert. So how come I am never with him anymore?—because he never said he had the time. But Devin does have the time, and he and I, only yesterday, were basking and stripped bare. As I write this, my face is turned toward you, the reader, and due to ill health, I have thin, downturned lips, which often work to extol and to uplift—why not Devin?—because that’s lulling. And here I am now, stroking my pet—my sheltie—although it is impossible for me to remain in this position for long—not quite sitting, standing, or lying down—because we are both leaning up against ground that steeply slopes. Below I can see how my town is enclosed within a very narrow area, between these hills and the sea. True, we are prone to sea storms and landslides, but this village also provides a panoramic view, amusements, and benefits, as well as a horrid gorge. But don’t let’s look at that. Let’s be happy. Let us enjoy our holidays and let us fall for or swear by whatever we want to—because people really like to! for pity’s sake The Krautheimers—rather, dub them the Goodenoughs!—rose to power near what, in this era, we are calling their violent emotions. Though nowadays the Goodenoughs rarely have their gall, jealousy, or alarm. On holiday, the old woman enjoys a tropical garden—any member of the public can visit—that is filled with pearly shell-ginger blossoms and lots of blue daze. This is dreamland to her—although she does have that pesky parapsoriasis on her torso. Certainly her overeating is risky after middle life, and her body’s tolerance for sugar has waned. Often among such old women, of course, a search for beauty is not uncommon. “Oh, look at the pretty black-and-white-spotted bird,” the old woman says. “Oh, the bird is afraid. The birdie is afraid. That poor bird. That’s a pretty one!” “What I want to know,” her old husband says, “is why does this palm tree have a smooth sock over its trunk—it looks like—when the rest of it is so rough?” “Watch your step!” The oldsters hear this said from behind them. “I say it in my sleep.” In the evening, the old man says, “Is that new? You look so cozy in your nightgown!” She has had it for years, and the gold-brown gauzy gown is ugly. Her teeth are nearly golden brown, too—very worn. Regardless, the old man has a renewed interest in his wife. He deems her sensible and polite—and is delighted she is within easy reach. Must there really be a need for harsh realism? The old man just saw his dear friend Chris Hake, who certainly did have Chris’s manner of walking, but, alas, he did not think the man had Chris’s head! Next, it looked like Giselle, the old man’s long-dead daughter, had come along. She appeared sullen enough to be dead, he thought, but was far too tall to be his daughter. A tot stood before him, with its fist pressed into its cheek, eyes closed, enraged or in pain, still and all— not complaining. That’s okay. Yes, okay, but this story is just not good enough yet. How about the old woman is an heiress!—seated at a gala feast, at a long, long table. There are thirty guests! Her ring boasts a gem as big as an ice rink, and it is passed around to be admired, so this heiress fears for her ring—well, she has pangs of anxiety, some regrets. diane! What in the world will her name be? Diane! I should not hurt anybody else I know with this story. I hope she is not too fake. At the lake she is often cheerful, although her eyebrows are frequently raised—a common response to the untoward or to the unexpected. A highly dangerous path leads to the lake. But why say that? It is not really dangerous—still, she should mind the uneven ground, the sudden downhills, and watch out for overgrown brambles, including the dewberries with small spines and stickers. She found herself on this day staring more deeply into her sorry romantic efforts than she ever did into... Why is the lake so hard to describe?—the wide water that is not the sea, but surely looks like it. Sometime after lunch, her friend Ellen Torch showed up to say, “I saw Fabio at the hardware!” “Did he see you?” “He did not. His nose was different, and his face looked boiled—and I thought of you!” “You thought of me? What shoes was he wearing?” “Sneakers. His gray hair was hanging down, awfully long.” “He doesn’t have gray hair.” “Well, it was hanging down, and I thought of you.” “I have gray hair.” And hadn’t Fabio and Diane once been the rulers of this house? In the upper part of the house is the long hall, like the stem of a weed whose little fruits are the several nice rooms that branch off from it. There’s the room Diane sleeps in, where she and Fabio had often fought, with its window that frames the magnolia, and when the tree blossoms, Diane tries to remember to stare long at it, to take its character all the way into herself and to keep the tree in there. “Fabio’s here!” Ellen said. “I see him! Let me hang up your coat.” So, is he friendly? For a fact, Diane is too ill-equipped to know. “So, which do you like?” Fabio said, pointing. “This is my favorite,” Diane said. “I chose it,” he said. “I remember saying, when we bought it, I want the one with the little neck.” “Will you stay here?” Diane said. No! And the vase he carried off was never meant to parade with flowers. Its neck is far too skinny and would only asphyxiate any bloom. Fabio sneezed several times, was blessed, and then he left with treasure.  By dinnertime, this story is ending, and we leave Diane behind—combing her hair how she does with her saw-cut comb. She is kneeling—pleasing me as she combs. She supplicates herself for someone, something!—for me. And she is authentic enough—a genuine imitation. I love her finger rings, her strings of beads, the various stones—lapis and carnelian.... I like the grosgrain ribbon in her hair that she has had to unloose. All this stuff and stuff, to my mind ... is what I revere. It is the best of her. is the founder and editor of the literary annual NOON.

        "story": "The night before my brother’s second wedding, he held a rehearsal dinner that was, per contemporary tradition, a rehearsal only for the pained social interactions that were to follow the next day. I was one of the guests of honor at an overpriced restaurant in the New Jersey town where we’d grown up, and my gift for diplomacy rendered me essential to my brother’s hopes for a successful weekend. But who tells stories about successful weekends? I had remained publicly neutral about my brother’s divorce less than a year prior. It had been clear from the start of his relationship with Elyse, never mind the relatively brief marriage portion of it, that it was not going to last until death did them part, unless, ha ha, one of them killed the other. But she had the kind of charisma that, when it shone on you, you couldn’t help but respond, even if, as proved the case for both my brother and me, it would have been far better if we hadn’t. I knew Elyse first. She bobbed into my orbit at my friend Megan’s fortieth birthday party, at a bar. We were both among the youth contingent at a gathering where most of the attendees were nearing or recently past the magical age being commemorated. I was not yet thirty, and Elyse was, it turned out, not even not yet thirty—she was not yet twenty-eight. Megan had rented out the entire place. She was a lawyer and a sometime essayist, so there were a lot of lawyers and sometime essayists, but Megan was also a bit fancy, so there was a smattering of fashion and magazine and whatever people, too. I was a whatever person. I had been a middle school English teacher for the first few years after college but realized that I strongly disliked children and teenagers—anyone more than five years younger than me, really. Since then I’d been writing grants, waitering, telling myself that I was really an artist, even though my art was a bit nebulous. I was a performance artist, I guess. I did disconcerting monologues at my friend’s monthly theater gathering in the back room of a bar, and I’d had a weeklong residency at an art space in SoHo where I’d read fortunes with a crystal ball, the content of which was cut and pasted from speeches by Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I was an acquired taste, though even I hadn’t quite acquired a taste for myself. Elyse was sitting at the bar by herself when I went up to get another drink, my manyth of the party. She was wearing an off-the-shoulder black cocktail dress, bright-red lipstick, and a furry Russian-style hat. It was late March but freezing outside, so the hat made her seem eccentric but not necessarily insane. That was my sweet spot. “So, how do you know Megan?” I said. “Oh, she helped me out of a copyright scrape a couple years ago,” she said. “I decided I was going to be the squire who follows the knight who saved his life. It turns out that means going to parties!” I knew Megan, I explained, because I’d told her fortune in an especially manic and insulting way, and she’d liked it so much she’d come back three times. “We’ve been collected,” Elyse said. “It is wise to make oneself collectible.” “What was the copyright thing?” I said. “Oh, I got a cease and desist because I was selling shirts with images of the Marvel characters having sex with one another. It was totally fair use, the whole thing was just nothing, but I guess I made just enough money that it was somehow worth it to make a fuss.” “You... make shirts?” “Oh, no. Well, I mean, yes, in that case. But it was to promote a journal that lasted about a second. I was sort of an editor there. Content wrangler. Put that on my business card.” We spent a good part of the night talking, pausing to chat with other guests who often approached us as if we were a couple or old acquaintances, which we accepted as our due and lightly elaborated on when we were so inclined. “Stepsiblings,” we said once. “Basically stepsiblings,” we said to someone else. I might have mentioned Jeremy that first night as we briefly toured our histories. I’m a big fan of my brother, he comes up a lot. He’s always been more mainstream than me, but not, you know, lame. He works for a tech company—I won’t dignify it with a name, but you know it. It’s just for the money, he says. He wants to produce films, and I still think he will, but first there was the pandemic, and now the baby, and maybe he’ll just make money. It’s good to know somebody will have some when I inevitably end up broke at forty-five and require costly organ transplants. Maybe he’ll find me a standby spot in the singularity. We did a couple more shots than we should have because it was an open bar, and at some point I lost track of Elyse and contented myself sharing an Uber home with a stoned, unspeaking editorial assistant who lived a few blocks from me. She did not want to come upstairs. Elyse texted in the morning and gave me shit about the direction my night had taken in a low-key, gratifying manner. I felt bonded to her in that ineffable New York way, where you know it’s going to be chill to talk to someone the next time you’re both at a gathering, one more little scrap added to the social mosaic, pieced together painstakingly over years, that reads, “I belong here.” We saw each other at a launch party for an admonitory book about the online alt-right, at a swank cocktail hour hosted by an editor neither of us knew, at a preview of a mutual friend’s unsettling hologram art. By the third run-in, we had gossip, jokes, intimacies. Elyse met Jeremy one weekend at my mother’s beach house. We’d seen each other with enough frequency at that point that it felt natural to invite her down. The thought was that we’d have some beach time, walk into town and eat some overpriced seafood, maybe go dancing at one of the trashy clubs on the island. I wanted to be my high school self, dramatic and sentimental and cared for. My intentions weren’t romantic, but they also weren’t entirely unromantic. I didn’t know Jeremy was going to be there, but we pulled up to the house and there he was, scruffy in a Mets hat, apparently “hot,” though I can’t really see it. He and I look nothing alike. He is sandy-haired, light-skinned, built like the former hockey defenseman gone slightly to seed that he is. I have the swarthy, dark-eyed look of my mother’s people, Syrian mostly, and keep thin by worrying and starving myself. Elyse claims there’s a strong resemblance between us “around the eyes.” Not the actual eyes, mind you, just, you know, around them. Jeremy was there with his girlfriend at the time, Beatrice, though we all knew that wasn’t going to last. She was intellectual, shy; there were admirable qualities. But I knew he wasn’t going to stay with someone who wasn’t conventionally beautiful. He wasn’t—isn’t—that type of guy. As for me, I bloomed so late that my whole family, myself included, assumed I was gay but not yet fully comfortable with it. Then I got to college and discovered androgynous medievalists, mostly but not always women, and it turned out that was my sexuality. I wanted, in bed, to be treated like delicate human property that sealed a diplomatic alliance; they wanted to be kings. I have continued, with brief exceptions, to cede land to whoever amasses a threatening coalition at my border. I could tell Jeremy was worried by Elyse from the start because he retreated. He was polite, charming—he can’t help but be these things, my brother—and then within minutes of our arrival he went for a run. Elyse is like a panther; she was aware that some underbrush had been disturbed. It was left to poor, doomed Beatrice to pick up the social slack, as I, stone-faced, immediately opened a bottle of white wine, and Elyse, too friendly and intimate, quickly stripped down to the bikini she had on under her T-shirt and shorts. Beatrice was, like my brother, a few years older than us, but she had the air of a high school freshman suddenly thrown in with the seniors. She assumed Elyse’s attention was fundamentally satirical, which wasn’t quite accurate. It was experimental. She was doing things to see how Beatrice would react, which would then tell Elyse how to feel about her. “Do you now or have you ever identified as a ‘beach bunny’?” Elyse said. Beatrice had declined a glass of wine when I’d offered, but now Elyse handed her one anyway. Beatrice accepted it and set it in front of her without sipping. “I’m not sure what you mean,” Beatrice said. “Right. Actually, have you even seen a bunny on the beach? It’s really just the alliteration, I suppose. But are you going to bask in the sun? Are you going to play the part of the apocryphal sand creature today?” “I can only do like an hour at a time. I quickly turn into a burned bunny, unfortunately.” “Oh, yikes, we don’t want that!” Elyse said. “Right, Connor? Or do you want a burned bunny?” “Elyse,” I said. “What are you even talking about.” The two of us went down to the beach and read on our towels until Jeremy came and found us. He was still sweaty from his run, ready for the ocean. I had no interest in disrupting my torpor, but Elyse was, of course, game, and they sprinted into the surf together. I watched them dive and chat, too far away for me to hear what they were saying, but they were obviously enjoying themselves. Elyse’s appeal wasn’t straight-up “cool girl,” or whatever we call that now, but that was certainly part of it when she wanted it to be. She charmed him, I learned later, by knowing some things about punk rock and having caustic but not overemotional analyses of the failings of the American left. She was, in some significant ways, basic, but that wasn’t how she presented most of the time, and this is very appealing to people like my brother, who through timidity or anxiety are always afraid that they’re missing out on intense, “real” experiences. As if just getting through a day wasn’t real enough. When they emerged from the ocean, they were already, on some level, a conspiracy of two. “You missed some good action out there,” Elyse said. “Not too cold?” I said. “Get used to it pretty quick,” Jeremy said, rubbing a faded Tropicana beach towel over his arms and shoulders. For the rest of that day and night, I watched Jeremy and Elyse recognize something in each other. When, after dinner, Elyse decided she had to go to a “real Jersey Shore club” and Beatrice excused herself to go back to the house, my mother couldn’t stop herself from trying to intervene. “Oh, honey, are you sure you want to do that?” she said. “Why don’t you stay out and have fun?” We all pleaded briefly and half-heartedly for her to reconsider, then left her to her fate. The clubbing was, of course, laughable. The “good place” had a crazy line and a fifteen-dollar cover, so we went to the “bad place,” which featured a band playing barely passable covers of Nineties alt-rock songs. We drank beers out of plastic cups and danced to “Just a Girl” and “Lovefool,” taking turns grabbing each other and spinning around in ways that began perfectly respectably but became less so as the evening went on. At some point Jeremy decided to set fire to the ol’ superego and put away several shots served in neon plastic shot glasses, encouraging us to do the same. In the midst of this, Elyse went missing for about five minutes, and Jeremy declared that he was “going to look for her,” leaving me to sort of sway mournfully to Savage Garden and contemplate which sins of mine had led me to this particular hell. When they returned, together, I didn’t think they’d been necking, necessarily, but some other line of intimacy had been crossed, some deliberate touch or implied promise of a future one. Or maybe they’d just hit Elyse’s vape pen. I didn’t really care. The whole day had crossover-episode vibes, and seeing them giggling together made me briefly happy about the interconnectedness of all things: family and friends, New York and New Jersey, past and present. Then I was miserable again. After a raucous, incoherent walk home, Jeremy staggered upstairs to the guest room where he and Beatrice were sleeping, and Elyse and I got ready to go to bed in the downstairs bedroom, which still featured the bunk beds my brother and I had slept in as kids. Elyse heaved herself into the top bunk so hard that the whole contraption nearly collapsed, and I refused, on personal-safety grounds, to sleep beneath her. We arrived at the “compromise” that we would share the bottom bunk. I was all too aware that I was serving as a weak substitute for Jeremy, whomever she imagined him to be, a warm body to bully and curl up next to. But I, too, was lonely, and charmed by her temporary need, and not above being taken advantage of. We didn’t even kiss, but there was so much desire radiating off her as she curled and shifted around me that we might as well have just fucked then and altered the whole timeline. Alas. On Sunday morning, I woke to an empty bed, and when I went upstairs, I found Beatrice and my mother on the deck drinking coffee. Elyse and Jeremy had gone for a run together, “before it got too hot.” When they returned, they immediately changed into bathing suits and went down to the ocean, making only the most cursory offer for us to join them. “She seems really great,” Beatrice said to me. When Elyse and I drove back to the city, I told her every bad thing I could think of about Jeremy—that he snored, that he didn’t cook, that he mostly read popular non-fiction—and she accepted it all with equanimity. “You love him so much, though,” she said. “Sure,” I said. “He’s a good brother, but a bad boyfriend.” “Sucks to be Beatrice,” Elyse said. I wrote Jeremy an email telling him that I thought Elyse was great and shaping up to be an important friend for me, but that I thought she’d be terrible for him because she was too self-involved and uncompromising. He responded: “Bro. Chill.” After a few weeks of suspicious silence, the summons to dinner by Elyse arrived. Jeremy was sitting with her at a table in the back corner of the restaurant. “I can’t imagine you’re very surprised...” Well, no. I assumed it would flame out quickly, become a weird “remember when you dated my brother?” kind of thing that I could bring up when we were high in the future. Instead, over a pizza at John’s on Bleecker a month later, Elyse said, as though she’d just remembered: “Oh! We’re getting married on Tuesday! At City Hall. You wanna come?” I thought she was joking; she was not. They were doing it “for the insurance and the taxes”—that’s why they needed to get it done by the end of the year—and also because “they fucking loved each other, and why not make a beautiful and stupid gesture?” (Elyse’s words, of course, my brother nodding along, as if such a sentiment would ever have crossed his mind independently.) “Have you told Mom and Dad?” I said. “Somehow I don’t think they’re gonna be thrilled,” Jeremy said. “I think I’m just gonna... not tell them.” “You won’t tell on us, will you, C?” Elyse said. “I think marriage is bullshit,” I said. “I just didn’t know you felt that way, too.” “I think it’s a little more complicated than that,” Jeremy said. “How?” Elyse said. “I don’t know,” Jeremy said. “It’s not like we don’t love each other.” She rolled her eyes and finished her beer. So I toasted them and bought another pitcher, and then we moved on to getting thoroughly trashed at the Kettle of Fish, which somehow still, twenty years after the smoking ban, reeked heavily of fresh smoke. When Jeremy got up to use the bathroom, I embraced Elyse. “I hope you kids know what you’re doing!” I yelled over the Lil Jon, playing it a little slapstick. “Oh, gosh, it doesn’t matter,” Elyse said. “Why are you so worried?” “He’s a serious guy, El,” I said. “He’s taking it all really seriously, and he’s pretending he’s not.” “What’s this about?” Elyse said. She looked at me clearly for what seemed like the first time in months, and I felt the thrill of her assessment. “I just want everybody to be happy,” I said. “The thing is, nobody stays happy, right?” Elyse said. But they could! I thought. If they took proper care. The City Hall scene was familiar to me from friends’ previous impulse marriages: Hispanic and Chinese and Russian couples dressed to the nines and smiling shyly with entire families in tow, some admixture of practicality and sentiment infusing the whole room with a slightly absurdist glow. That one could change so much with a bit of paperwork and a few simple words! I tried to catch Jeremy’s eye, but he had an easy, impenetrable grin fixed on his face, with no offer to go beyond it. Elyse was manic with excitement, gorgeous in a form-fitting white sweater dress. Hanging out in her apartment that morning, vaguely “helping,” I’d resisted the urge to kiss her, or tell her I didn’t know how I felt about her, exactly, but that I needed to say something. I lacked, and lack, courage. Once it was done, I tried to put her and Jeremy out of my mind, worked on my own stuff, attempted to take myself more seriously. I met up regularly with my friend Marcus to work on our pilot about a family that runs a failing amusement pier on the Wildwood Boardwalk, but we couldn’t seem to figure out the third act. One day, I let slip to my mother in a manner I can’t quite recall that Jeremy had married Elyse; within an hour, I had a furious call from Jeremy accusing me of sabotaging him. He didn’t believe me that it wasn’t deliberate, and to be fair, I didn’t quite believe it either. Elyse and I met up for dinner soon after that. “You realize your hostility toward your brother has an effect on me, right?” she said. “I love my brother,” I said. “Hmm.” Sometime later, she abruptly said: “He is rather serious, isn’t he?” “What happened?” “He doesn’t like it when I fuck around, ‘waste my potential.’ I have to convince him that it’s perfectly natural for me to meet my friend Thomas at ten am to get high and see the restored Inland Empire. You know, like, that’s the job.” “What does he want you to do?” “Get a real job? Or at least worry about it.” “He makes a ton of money,” I said. “I know, but that’s, quote, ’not the point.’ Sigh. I don’t know. There are some philosophical differences we have to work out.” When they came back from their Italian honeymoon, Jeremy was suddenly seized by the urge to move out of the city. In his telling, the time away had made him realize that New York was making him anxious. He wasn’t sleeping well, he wasn’t doing good work, going out was boring and stressful. I wondered, in response, whether things with Elyse might be causing this, rather than “the city,” but he rejected that possibility. Things with Elyse were good, except for some minor, typical disagreements and misunderstandings. And anyway, why would a marriage that was barely a marriage—a technicality, really—be causing him so much trouble? I let the rhetorical question linger, but he chose not to pick it up. He’d gotten it in his head that Boston or its surrounds was the answer to their problems. His company had an office in Cambridge that he could commute to, and he’d gone to college in New England and still harbored a romantic notion of the region. There seemed to be some idea that if he secreted Elyse off to a place where she wouldn’t know anyone and where there was nothing fun or sexy to do, he might be able to reform her into the kind of person he would have wanted to publicly marry. I don’t think Elyse was actually sleeping with other people. She just liked to talk about the possibility, and to stay out late doing drugs, and to not have to account for herself. This was, in some circles, considered normal. But what friends my brother did have were people he’d known since college, or for far longer. They’d been with their partners for years, sometimes a decade, and despite their liberal politics, they were conservative in their manners. The fact that Elyse did not conform to this type had originally been the appeal, of course. One night they had an especially vicious argument about her supposed domestic obligations. She’d gone to the Met to see an exhibition that she was planning to write about, but hadn’t told him that she was meeting an ex-boyfriend there, with whom she spent the rest of the day in the park and then had a long dinner. She’d come home tipsy and happy, and he’d laid into her about how selfish and uncaring she was. She got so frustrated that she walked across the neighborhood to my apartment, where she arrived with only a text as a warning minutes before. I had, in fact, been in the very slow process of seducing my friend Liza—this had involved a poorly prepared vegan stew, Bitches Brew, and a number of provocative heavy silences—when I received Elyse’s message. The first half hour of her visit thus involved a delicate volley of small talk until Liza reluctantly (I hoped) did the polite thing and excused herself from the scene. The indefinite postponement of the night’s expected culmination was, perhaps, what made me more forceful than usual in my dealing with Elyse. “I don’t understand why you’re still doing this,” I said. “It’s just a piece of paper. Clearly you’re not happy.” “That’s not always true,” Elyse said. “When we both calm down, it’s fine. We’re just both, like, amped up most of the time.” “It’s called incompatible,” I said. “Someone needs to cede control.” “You’re great at that, right?” Elyse said. “You came here! I was having a great night.” “Right, but you still told me to come up.” There was a pause that I allowed to linger. “Well, how do you feel?” I said. I sat down on the floor so that we were at eye level. She straightened her back so that I was now looking up at her. She crossed her arms, held back the hint of a triumphant smile. “You’re really fucking cute,” she said. “Brother. In law. It can be complicated.” I thought she might have misunderstood me. “I don’t think you should be with Jeremy,” I said slowly, trying to be firm. “I don’t know if that means you should be with me.” “Right, because one Thompson kid hasn’t been enough.” “Maybe it’s just the wrong one,” I said. I looked up at her with what I hoped wasn’t a completely abject expression. Though, why not? “You get points for gumption,” she said. “If nothing else.” I got off the floor and we went for a long walk through Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, and then Sunset Park. When we got back to her neighborhood, she led us to her and Jeremy’s apartment. “This is where you want to be?” I said. “You’ll be the first to know,” she said. I didn’t hear from either of them for a couple of months, the longest I’d probably ever gone in my life without communicating with Jeremy, and by far the longest without talking to Elyse since we’d met. Then they wrote to me, separately, on the same day. Jeremy texted first, while I was out at dinner with some theater friends: “hey, I think Elyse and I might be splitting up. it just isn’t good for either of us right now. really really sad about it. call me when you can?” Then, an hour later, a text from Elyse: “been thinking about you a lot. wrong thompson kid?” Guess which one I responded to first. During their two months of silence, they’d apparently been too busy fighting with each other to stay in touch with me, and neither had felt ready to let me in on the depth of their dysfunction. Jeremy, I was shocked to learn, had taken to smashing plates and glasses in frustration; Elyse had, more than once, stayed out all night to be away from him, even staying in a seedy hotel on Atlantic Avenue one night as a kind of self-annihilating gesture. My parents seemed to be relieved, for the most part, by the news of their separation, though my mother, with her fundamentally conciliatory nature, did wish that they could have “found some happiness between them.” Still: “At least there were no children.” We didn’t start sleeping together until after the divorce was finalized. That was important to me, if not particularly so to Elyse. On good days, I told myself Jeremy would understand, or that he could be made to understand. We had the same blood, after all. It didn’t require much subterfuge to keep our relationship secret. Jeremy moved to Cambridge, proving to himself, at the very least, that his desire to become a New Englander had not been entirely motivated by a wish to protect Elyse from the evils of the big city. I talked to him frequently, and commiserated with his distress, though, as I had suspected he might, he seemed happier, lighter, as soon as he’d decided to end things with her. I had plenty to talk with him about, as I’d managed to turn a fairly bizarre, self-enfolding monologue I’d written into a “one-man show,” and it had been accepted by a small, prestigious theater festival. I felt, for the first time, like my work might be coalescing into something like a career. That period had a fugitive, reckless quality. Elyse and I made out through an obscene body-horror movie at the Nitehawk, then snuck into a superhero sequel to come down. Things exploded all over the screen, and we stared, happy. So much waste for our enjoyment. We drove to beaches we didn’t know—Asbury Park, Seaside Heights—renting tiny houses or staying in decrepit motels, drinking ourselves stupid and watching HBO, terribly amused with ourselves. She came with me to the Hudson Valley to see my show at the festival, where we were wantonly “together,” out loud, in a way that we weren’t usually. People seemed to enjoy the monologue—they laughed, and did that thing after where they insisted, wide-eyed, that they’d “actually” really loved it. Actually! Elyse betrayed no surprise at the quality of the show. Either she took it for granted that I was good, or she didn’t care one way or the other. I tried to believe this indicated unconditional affection. By the time I got up to Cambridge to visit Jeremy a few months later, he was dating Margaret. Massachusetts Catholic, lawyer with a lean-in vibe, but self-aware about it—the right kind of person for him. I could see how comfortable he was with her, and I could tell Margaret was nervous around me. I was giving off a spiky energy, probably. Secretly in love, high on my talent. I had some irrational hostility built up toward Jeremy too, a combination of jealousy for having had Elyse and contempt for screwing it up. Elyse was not mentioned, and it occurred to me to wonder whether Margaret knew about her existence at all. Perhaps some of Elyse’s amorality had rubbed off on him, allowing him to justify doing what he needed to do, including selective omissions, to secure future happiness. If I’d thought he would have been able to pull it off indefinitely, I’d have approved. The next day, Margaret had work to do, so Jeremy and I walked to a brewery near his house, a big industrial space that smelled like ripe hops and an indoor swimming pool. His first question, after minimal small talk: “Have you heard from Elyse lately?” “Sure, a little,” I said. “She doing okay?” “She seems good, yeah.” “Not too good, I hope.” “No?” “She used me, dude,” he said. “I don’t even know how to talk about it. I just know it wasn’t right, how she treated me. She thought I was some kind of joke.” I took a long pull of beer and tried to find a way to navigate this. “Love is fucking weird,” I said, insightfully. “Neither of you has to justify it. You both learned something about yourselves. Maybe that’s enough.” “What did she learn?” he said. “Well, I think she learned what she didn’t want,” I said. He grimaced. “Are you... I’m not going to tell you who you should be friends with,” he said. “Okay.” “But you should be careful.” “Got it.” “Seriously. Don’t get involved with her. I don’t know if that’s even the kind of thing you’re into right now. But just... don’t.” I went back to New York and reported the whole thing to Elyse. She was amused, but not, I don’t know, uproarious. His lack of generosity clearly unsettled her. It made me wonder whether there was something I was missing, something neither of them was telling me. In general, life moves too slowly for me, the same things always happening, me half learning lessons and just as quickly forgetting them. But that period went by too quickly. Elyse and I stumbled through dinners with friends and parties and museum visits and nosebleed seats at the opera, amusing ourselves and each other. We brainstormed a lesbian heist screenplay that would have been absolutely unwatchable. When we were apart for any length of time, we texted each other filth, things I would have been embarrassed to say or enact in person. I convinced myself that gravity did not exist. After all of six months together (but who was counting?), Jeremy announced that he and Margaret were engaged. They wanted to do “something small” with “a few friends and family” in our hometown in October. Though this was not part of the official announcement, Jeremy told me that Margaret, at thirty-six, was very anxious about having children—the time had come and, given her Catholic family, marriage was crucial in order to achieve this end. “Do you love her?” I said. “For sure.” “Maybe you should take a minute, though.” “Margaret doesn’t really feel like she has a minute,” he said. “So, you know, smoke ’em while you got ’em.” Elyse was immediately dismissive, though Jeremy suddenly seemed to come up with more frequency than usual (often something like “Oh, Jeremy hated when I did that” after peeing with the bathroom door open, drinking beer in bed, etc.). Even if neither of us explicitly acknowledged it, his decision to commit to Margaret made us self-conscious about our entanglement’s lack of definition. It wasn’t that I wanted, necessarily, for things to be official between us; even in the blur of my infatuation, I knew that this would be inviting disaster. But I felt some kind of grief for what the relationship couldn’t be. If our relationship was unconventional—in truth, we rarely had sex, and when we did, it was more theoretical than bodily, more gear than flesh—it at least had the potential to appear normal from the outside. I got mopey. Elyse’s response to this was to bully me, which I accepted as my due and tried to enjoy. I wasn’t writing enough, so she banned me from reading the Times for a week, which she enforced by quizzing me on the news. If I got anything right, even by accident, I was sentenced to more time in ignorance. This did not lead to increased productivity. A month before Jeremy’s wedding, Elyse started suggesting—jokingly, I assumed, and then less so—that I bring her as my date. This was so obviously impossible that I didn’t even understand her point. “I’m just saying, if you want me to be a part of your life, it has to start somewhere,” she said. “Right,” I said. “But not here.” “Aren’t I?” she said. “A part of your life?” “You’re something.” “I see. Something bad.” We went in circles on the subject a few times, with her digging in more and more about my unkindness. It was the only time I’d ever said no to her, which I suppose is what made it worthy of conflict. The compromise, arrived at under exhausted duress, was that she would come with me and stay in my hotel room, but would not, under any circumstances, interact with Jeremy or anyone else at the wedding. Yes, I know. Elyse insisted on dressing like a character gone incognito in a Hollywood thriller, with sunglasses and her scarf tied under her chin, which, in Princeton, just made her look like the median wealthy local. That first night at the hotel was perfect. We took edibles and spent what felt like forever in the Jacuzzi, ordered bloody burgers from room service and ate them naked on the bed like animals, groped each other desultorily in the mess. We were proving a point about how much fun we could have together, I think, egging each other on. The next day I was supposed to wake up early and help Jeremy with whatever was needed—get Margaret’s family “settled,” keep my parents away from each other, whatever. I showered and dressed and promised Elyse I would visit. As I walked Margaret’s parents back to the hotel a couple of hours later, I nearly crashed into Elyse walking in the direction we’d just come from. She turned her head so that I couldn’t catch her eye and did not stop. When I got back to the room, I texted and called her but received no response. Her phone, I discovered, was on the bedside table. I went about my further duties with a fatalistic cheer. I knew something disastrous was going to happen, and there was nothing I could do about it. The time for the rehearsal dinner came, and I still hadn’t seen or heard from Elyse. I got dressed as slowly as I could, tying and retying my tie, trying to make it look like it hadn’t been done by a ten-year-old. When she didn’t show, I walked to the restaurant. There was my family, and some friends of Jeremy’s I didn’t like, and Margaret’s family, and, presumably, some friends of Margaret’s, and, sitting at the bar, her back to the whole scene and apparently unnoticed by Jeremy or my parents, yet extremely visible to me owing to the brightly patterned Grey Gardens kerchief she’d been wearing for the past twenty-four hours: Elyse. Instead of screaming and running out into traffic, or feigning illness and spending the entire night in a toilet stall, I grinned like a moron and babbled non sequiturs at the assembled dignitaries. I was too nervous to eat the hors d’oeuvres; even water wasn’t going down easily. After almost an hour of this—we were still in the mingling stage somehow—Jeremy took me aside. “Are you coked out?” he said. “I wish,” I said. “Just excited, I guess.” “That’s not like you.” “I’m really happy for you,” I said. “Are you sure?” I could feel myself trembling. Elyse had really thought, she told me later, that it would be fun, in a perverse way, for her to be there in secret, and she’d thought that I would be able to handle it. She’d gotten spooked by her proximity to the family and the bride and needed to get out of the hotel, then had enough drinks and Xanax that making a mysterious visitation without revealing herself somehow seemed the best way to reconcile the various strands of inner and outer conflict she was facing. Lined up in a certain way, her sitting at that bar wasn’t worse, really, than marrying and divorcing Jeremy in front of me. It was control. But this was too much. The setting, my lack of sleep and hydration, the public role. It made Elyse’s presence feel less like a farce than a haunting. “Over there,” I said, jutting my chin toward the bar. He turned, and for just a moment I wondered, gratefully, if I’d hallucinated her presence, if maybe it really was just a well-kempt lady of Princeton drinking alone on a fall Friday night. But when Jeremy turned back to face me, I knew I’d been right. “What is this?” he said gravely. “What is the point of this?” “I told her...” I said. “Ah,” he said. “You told her.” “She’ll leave,” I said. “She’s making some kind of point to me. It has nothing to do with you.” I could hear the stupid panic in my voice as I tried to ascertain what he was thinking. It hadn’t occurred to me until that moment that it actually might have been about him, at least a little bit. And if that was the case, despite everything going on in that moment, I felt, more than anything else, jealous. “Stay here,” he said to me, and walked to the bar. I saw him tap her on the shoulder. She turned and smiled up at him, her radiant best, as though she’d just been waiting for him to come over and say hello so that she could offer her congratulations. He embraced the role of gracious host. I couldn’t hear them, but I could read the gestures clearly—this is too crazy you’re here, you should come say hi to everyone!; oh, no, I couldn’t, but thank you; seriously, we’ve got plenty of food; thanks, but I actually have to head out in a minute. She moved smoothly, slowly, like she was underwater, and I imagined I could see the rage radiating off his casual gestures. It all unfolded with a grim lucidity. They parted with a brief, tight hug and he walked back over to me. “She’s crazy,” he said. “But what’s your fucking problem?” He moved away from me before I could answer and then walked over to Margaret, joining the conversation she was having with her uncle or whomever. Before I could decide what to do, Jeremy clinked a fork against his glass and started delivering his welcome speech. I watched Elyse float past and out the door while the group was distracted, her face a blur. She wasn’t in the room when I got back that night, and she’d taken her things with her. By the time I gave my toast at the reception the next day, in a tent on the battlefield lawn in the late-afternoon dusk, I was in a fugue state. I’ve seen pictures. I looked great. Jeremy didn’t speak to me beyond public address and to tell me where to stand for the photos. I couldn’t even cry; I didn’t understand what was happening. When it was finally all over, I sat in my hotel room staring at TV shows until dawn, then took the first train back to the city. A significant part of Jeremy’s discomfort, I’m convinced, was the reminder that he was settling for something far more conventional and less interesting than what he’d briefly had. But Elyse’s vanishing act felt less explicable. For most people, embarrassment would probably cover it. But she was not someone who had ever expressed that sensation in my presence, and I wasn’t sure she was capable of it. Of course, her silence was more pregnant with meaning than whatever the truth was, which I suspected, ungenerously, was mostly just a childish compulsion to cause trouble. One Monday night a few weeks later, I went to her apartment unannounced. She buzzed me up, and I started crying as soon as she opened her apartment door. “I know, I know,” she said. “I know!” She spent the night comforting me, as though the source of my upset was something other than her. I asked her if showing up at the rehearsal dinner had been her way of breaking up with me. “I didn’t think so at the time,” she said. “Did you break up with me?” “Well, not very successfully, obviously,” she said, and smiled. When I left in the morning, it was with a resolve not to return. If she wanted me, I told myself—wanted anything from me—she would have to seek me out. And so. It is increasingly clear to me, holed up in my mother’s empty, neglected beach house, that I’ve conjured the best of Elyse to keep myself company during what has otherwise been a solitary time. This was also true when I was in the city, but loneliness can be disguised by fun, by activity, even by worry. Here, the world is an abstraction. I read, I work on my new play (guess what it’s about). I take long walks past the old fishing pier, past the undeveloped blocks with expensive houses, all the way to the water tower, and then back toward home. It’s still too cold to sit outside most days, but it’s warming up. I made sure—using my mother as intermediary—that Jeremy and Margaret weren’t planning to stay in the house before I claimed it for a while. Margaret is some significant number of months pregnant, my mother conveyed tactfully, and they want to stay close to her hospital and doctors. The moppet Margaret is gestating will help, I hope, improve upon our current impasse, at least provided it keeps adding cells at the expected pace. Elyse knows where I am. I imagine her in a small, powerful car, slowly rumbling down the quiet block, pulling into the driveway. Rented, borrowed, stolen? I will listen to her story and decide whether to believe it. The people next door have big parties out on their deck on the weekends, multiple generations crammed together in coats, grilling and listening to contemporary country music and shouting over one another at an unnecessary volume. They must be renters, carrying on like that. The other night it was warm enough for me to sit on my own deck for hours while this happened, passive-aggressively “reading” but mostly just spying on them. I watched a family of three—mother and father in their late thirties, a little boy maybe five years old—that mostly kept to themselves, looking bemused by everything going on around them and rarely interacting with anyone else. I thought at first that they were the ones living in the house, that they had been overrun by their rowdy family, but no, they left after a couple of hours. They were just polite relations with an exit strategy. Eventually I went inside and let the neighbors rage on without me, contemplating noise complaints deep into the night. The weeks are quiet, at least. But I don’t know. Maybe the silence is worse. is the author of the novel Early Work and the story collection Cool for America.

        "story": "“No bears,” said Vera, the realtor, who lived next door in a blue colonial. “Bobcats, however...” She crossed the kitchen to the Dutch door and unlatched it. She pointed to a low branch in the grove. “One left a carcass hanging there.” Ann imagined something like a draped towel. Vera glanced at her watch and muttered, “Dinnertime.” Ann and Elgar signed the lease. The rest needed little exaggeration: the property had a massive stone that George Washington once gave spirited orations from; clusters of money were said to be buried in the backwoods. Black walnut trees stretched needle-thin like Giacometti sculptures, and the rent was even cheaper than the Bed-Stuy warehouse from Ann’s college years, where she’d shared a bed with a ceramicist beneath the building’s central heater. When they couldn’t sleep, the ceramicist would try retelling the Iliad from memory while Ann covered her head with a Tempur-Pedic pillow. Ann hadn’t yet met her husband, but Elgar had been hooked on opiates then, in a peeling duplex with musty mattresses barricading the windows. Now he was a land surveyor with a patient heart. They moved into the cottage the following week. Their excitement was a stingray, sailing across the base of unknown, ink-dark waters. Ann was unpacking winter clothes when Vera ambled through the grove to invite them over for dinner. “Now,” Vera added, as if suddenly remembering she had left the kettle on, and Elgar put down a box of hangers. In the moonlight, the black walnuts seemed to sway sentiently, like elephant trunks. Vera served them rotisserie chicken and asparagus, and herself many glasses of wine. Sunflower shells slipped from her lips and into a Café Bustelo can as she told them about the game warden next door who took care of legions of swans. Apparently they were a lucrative trade now. “Hotels want swans, restaurants want swans...” She paused to spit out a shell. “Corporate offices want swans for their courtyards...” Elgar leaned back in his chair and told a story about how he had discovered the violence of swans. He was a child then; earlier in the day he had witnessed his mother covering up her bruised eyes, and everything he thought he knew about the inner lives of those he loved became clouded by a strange uncertainty. Later that day, the swans at the park had come at him with certain, sharp bills when he tried to pet them. “Swans can be very willful and athletic,” Vera explained. “When it’s time to bring them back inside, their necks lash around like snakes ready to strike.” Vera went on to talk about a young woman who used to live with the game warden. Her job was to bake biscuits that contained sedatives for the swans. She had lived in the in-law suite until one winter when she was trampled by horses. After dinner, Elgar and Ann laughed their way back across the grove. Things were still sturdy and blissful between them. Without curtains, all Ann could see through the windows was the flat night. Ann was an appraisal assistant for a private-estate liquidator. When she and Elgar first met, their friends had laughed at the totality of their match—how together they could assess the true value of any house and its contents, a prospect that she always found bleak and not at all romantic. Perhaps it came from her own self-consciousness, or how an undergraduate degree in history led to what she considered to be a fixation on surfaces. What had started as a summer job pricing Staffordshire lamps and Regency-era tables for an auction house gave rise to a sticky eye for all jewelry and signed lithographs, imagining what they would look like in her own home. She had never placed bids on any of the auctions (it was against the rules) until a shipment from the estate of a former Cambridge psychoanalyst arrived at her office. Included was a pair of Italian alabaster Swiss-cheese bookends. Two marbly quarters of a cheese wheel, complete with a wax rind and miniature alabaster mice that peeked out from the holes. Ann wanted the bookends the way she wanted a cave, something impossible and completely unrelated to her life, and so she went home and set up an account under Elgar’s name and made an opening bid of thirty dollars. Next, she bid on a brass beetle with hinged wings to ash cigarettes onto, even though she didn’t smoke. Then a bread knife that looked like a baguette. She bid on objects that looked like other objects, and wondered what pleasure the analyst must have found in them. If they had belonged to anyone else—another collector, a designer, pop musician, or policeman—she would have thought nothing of them, or found them garish and chintzy, but something about their being selected by an individual whose job was to deeply observe the human mind made her trust that she needed them. Ann didn’t win any of the lots, but when she went into the office the next day, she pocketed a Limoges box that was made to look like a strawberry (it was so small, and no one had picked it up after the auction), which put her in a probationary period with the agency. It was a minor, embarrassing event that she’d kept even from Elgar and disguised with a seemingly sudden desire to take up freelance bookkeeping, a pursuit that Elgar encouraged and supported. Ann thought that the psychoanalyst must have known something about how one cannot look away from something in disguise, or the thing beneath a thing, or the mystery of two worlds colliding into one. Or perhaps these objects were never his to begin with, and he had instead lived in an ordinary, unadorned one-bedroom apartment with a fireplace and a cat. She erased the whole experience from her mind. Yet something about this fixation held on. One of the first things Ann did after they moved into the cottage was to drive around the long, winding roads to see the large, dilapidated mansions and guess at their contents. Some of the houses were so big that they resembled glaciers more than homes. One appeared to be four stories and was the shade of a looming sandstone cliff, with a mossy green roof. Similarity to nature gave the houses a menacing cruelty: they pretended to be homes but could never be entered. In the end, Ann thought apocalyptically, the mountains would tumble over and bury us beneath them like ants. Ann found the story behind the bed. Elgar was measuring a property in the country, and it was her first time alone in the cottage. The story was written on the first page of an otherwise empty notebook. The notebook was sky blue; she’d found it while sweeping dust and hair that had been carried into crevices by tides of moving air. “The woman has an unseemly scar down her neck. When she laughs, it sounds like a car wreck, which is what I imagine late at night—running my car over her, blood seeping through her ratted, red hair,” it read. The narrator looked upon the body in relief. Ann crouched beside the bed, rereading with hot eyes. Ann also had a scar down her neck, long red hair, and a loud laugh. She scanned the scene for some small difference, something that might indicate it was not what she thought it was. She examined the handwriting as if it might be someone else’s besides her husband’s. The thought of another woman’s having left the notebook there briefly gave her some strange relief. Or perhaps Elgar had found it on one of his jobs and brought it home to show her, to have a laugh? The passage was neatly written, as if crafted thoughtfully and with finality. But Ann was typically called “Ann” by her husband, or “Annnnn” if she was in a distant room. Elgar had never referred to her, as far as she knew, as “the woman.” In their ten years of marriage, Ann only remembered him describing her scar as “beautiful” and her laugh as “irresistible,” and whenever she’d step out of the shower and let her long hair fall, he would refer to it positively, even if with as vague a descriptor as “nice.” Ann replaced the notebook where she had found it, kind of fallen between his side of the bed and the wall, where the outlet and some internet cables disappeared farther down into the molding. She shook the dustpan over the narrow space, coating everything again with lint. She backed out of the room like a rewound tape but lost herself along the way. By the time she reached the doorway, she had plunged into a machinelike panic. No matter how hard she tried to breathe—inhaling for four seconds and exhaling for six, as she had learned to do from one of her mindfulness videos—her heart rose in her throat like the sudden rush of boiling milk. Later, while turning over the sentences in her mind, Ann would take offense at their commonness. Anyone, a man at the grocery store, or a girl in a passing car, could glimpse her red hair, or hear her shattering laugh through the rolled-down window, and think it ugly. If the story had detailed the way she procrastinated paying her parking tickets, or the way she hummed when pleased, then she could perhaps discern a trace of intimacy in its authorship. Specificity is known by specific people, while universals are known by the universe, Ann had always thought. Ann didn’t answer Elgar’s calls when they came. In the afternoon, she took to the forested trail in the backyard with hedge clippers and cut away the reaching vines and thorned branches. She obsessed over clearing and editing the forest path, but she only found herself surrounded at all sides—by rivers and old footbridges, meadows and conifers. A patch of yarrow grew at the edge of the field, a squirrel chattered, a robin preened its wing, and Ann sat on a bench beside a trailhead where she could see a neighboring estate through the trees. Where the canopy thinned, out past the property line, was an empty garden with geometric red dahlias, and a long glass house. To its side was a lake filled with swans. They coasted, like sailboats, and a man swam alongside them. He was like an eel, all skin, and when he pulled himself out of the water Ann felt a light turn on. It was “pure fiction,” Elgar said, setting his coffee cup down. They splintered off into a brief argument in the kitchen—Ann didn’t believe that there could exist a shadow unattached to an object. What inspired the story, if not some true version, however fleeting, of those very thoughts? He apologized, embarrassed, and said he didn’t know what else to say. It was a story. But why her exact description? Ann pleaded, shaking over the sink. “It was just a story,” Elgar insisted. “Not even a story. A thought. A fictional thought. Not reality.” Since when did he start writing? Ann thought. And wasn’t it reality that didn’t make sense, and fiction, uniquely, the place where sense could be made? After that, the sky-blue notebook disappeared. Perhaps Elgar had brought it with him to work, or destroyed it, or taken extra steps to hide it, but when Ann asked where it was, he said he couldn’t recall. Perhaps he had forgotten about it entirely since their argument, though Ann thought it unlikely. She considered how Elgar, since she had known him, strived for honesty and integrity, but picturing him running her over—kindly and patiently—fissured everything she knew into sharp, weaponlike pieces. Ann began crafting horrific versions of events as they happened in real time. When she cut carrots for soup and Elgar came up behind her to kiss her neck, she imagined him imagining a fictional character sneaking up behind her with a hatchet. When the two of them drove to the theater, she imagined him imagining the two of them landing in a ditch. When Elgar told a joke, Ann kept her laugh low, and when she spoke, she spoke softly. When Elgar said, “I love you,” she asked, “Really?,” which was something she had never done. Nothing between them had ever truly been wrong, even when Ann’s mother died from tracheal cancer and Elgar’s conspiratorial brother held them at gunpoint. The notion of Ann’s likeness being run over by a car became a disease that caught her in a wave of bright light. It stalked and brittled the silences around her thoughts, robbed her rest and replaced it with a resentment that ran so clear that it could have been mistaken for water. Its grip even frightened Ann into considering some kind of forgiveness or reprieve. But forgiveness and reprieve were the last things she desired. Ann wanted knowledge, specifically about whether other stories existed, or what else might be going on inside Elgar’s head. Vera was out on her porch with a pitcher of lemon water and a honeydew melon that she had cut with a long thin knife. When Ann checked the mailbox, Vera called her over, and they sat on the porch watching the black walnut trees. Ann wanted to ask Vera what she would do if she had glimpsed a secret act of hatred by her dearest friend, but she kept quiet instead, sipping her drink. We all have dark ideas, Ann imagined Vera replying. What is more untruthful: A thing written down, or a sustained deception of the heart? Writing could be a kind of exorcism. Ann remembered Elgar once telling her that one cannot help if a bird flies over one’s head, but one can prevent it from building a nest there. Ann could no longer tell if a dark written thought was a bird passing overhead or a built nest. She tried to ram her brain against the question, but it was no use. She thanked Vera for the water and wandered back to the house in a blank state. That night, she felt animals press at the other side of the windowpanes. Teams of creatures and carcasses and horrible music. Elgar went to work. Ann left her phone at home and went to the woods, shaping and hacking any excess so that the paths widened. She made her way to the bench from which she could see the lake of swans. She stood still behind a tree, observing their slender white bodies move over the water. Their eyes were sharp and dark, as if they wore sunglasses. She had been watching them for so long she forgot she was leering at someone’s backyard. Smooth stones with names like truth, loyalty, and respect that once outlined the paths of her decisions were now covered in thick mental tar. Perhaps a week ago Ann would have walked on, but today she stepped across the property line. It could be admissible as a mistake, she thought in a low tremolo, despite there being a wiry gate with a sign that said private property, and a clear divide between wild woods and tended grounds. A plan formed in her mind as she crept closer to the glass house and the smooth-moving swans. If she was able to so simply cross over into the game warden’s property, perhaps she could cross over into Elgar’s hidden desires too. She could search through his phone while he was in the shower, look through his Notes app. No, Elgar always brought his phone with him, she recalled. Ann wanted to know the deepest recesses of him. She wanted to open his head and scrape his brain with a fork. Fuming thoughts fueled her across the stranger’s yard, toward the tall red dahlias. Their petals pointed neatly like spears, and together they looked like marionettes. Ann paused and listened for the sounds closest to her, and then those farthest. A tittering bird nearby, and an occasional rustle of movement against water in the distance. Ann was fully in the open now, steadily traversing the moss, seemingly unseen. She reached the door of the glass house. Now her life was pulsing. Through the glass was a kitchen. Its walls were bright red, and at its center was a butcher block with containers arranged in stacks. They held thick, coinlike biscuits. Ann remembered Vera’s story about the former assistant who had been crushed by horses, and wondered whether the biscuits contained something that might knock Elgar out. She was overcome with a resolute desire to open the back door and steal one. The nearest sound was the blood pumping around her brain, and the farthest was the creaking of the hinges of the door before her. All boundaries were cut. One unlikely action can be the result of a hidden well of unkempt thoughts. The house smelled of cinnamon and peat. Ann opened a container and filled her hands. She would bring a biscuit home and serve it to Elgar on a plate and wait for him to fall asleep, so that she could unlock his phone and unearth his hidden hate for her. Yet the thought that brought the most dread was that there would be nothing of the sort, only generous accounts. The game warden appeared in the yard. He was lean like an army sergeant as he strode toward the lake. He paused at the edge. Ann couldn’t tell where his eyes were, and for a moment she was certain that he was staring directly at her, until he undressed completely and took gradual steps into the water. An unbearable wash of abstract thoughts seized her behind her eyes and below her waist when she saw him disappear below the surface and emerge floating on his back. The swans initially dispersed but were now circling him like the beads of a necklace. Had he seen her? She imagined him entering the red kitchen dripping. She imagined him pushing her onto the butcher block and climbing over her. Suddenly all her rage and distrust toward Elgar were redirected through the game warden and into herself. But this was just a thought. A thought was not reality. Through the glass, she watched the game warden pull himself out of the water and wrap a blue towel around his waist. Ann remained still, mimicking the furniture, though her eyes shook like dice. The swans followed him across the yard as he approached the house. Should she run to the door? Would Elgar have to bail her out of jail? Or maybe she could spring into the hallway behind her, where there were a staircase and a dining room with a table and chairs painted light orange. She could neither hide nor move; the best thing to do would be to lie flat against the floor, but it was too late even for that. For a moment, the game warden was close enough to the glass that Ann could make out a tattoo on his shoulder. He walked past the kitchen window and along the side of the house. The sound of shoes rubbing against a welcome mat came from another part of the house. Ann’s hands spasmed and gripped the biscuits to dust. A swan peered at her from the water. For a moment, the display of her own heart felt like a piercing kind of grace. The game warden closed the front door and put into motion a percussive score of pockets emptying, closet doors opening and closing, and footsteps starting their way somewhere. Ann’s low horror at herself became a high horror toward the immediate moment, which then lifted for a short window, letting her jump into action, anchorless. She assessed the kitchen around her. There—a large cedar door. It opened easily. Inside was the suggestion of a pantry. Ann entered. She curled herself down and silently broke into a trembling fit. The pantry was long enough for her to lie down lengthwise, but Ann crouched by the hinges of the door, balancing on the balls of her feet. Her ears strained past her heartbeat until she found a sound to decipher. The game warden must have been in a distant room—all she could discern were nominal creaks and fluctuating baseboards. Everything took on an amplified life in the dark. A dripping faucet, when focused on, began to resemble a woman in high heels walking down a hallway far away. She remembered her therapist’s advice to touch three things to calm down, so she touched the cold stone floor, her hair, and her lips. She would stay until the game warden went to sleep, and then leave as quickly as she had entered. Elgar was probably heading back now, Ann thought to herself, patting down her pockets in search of her phone, which she then remembered she’d left at home. Panic came on like rain. She wondered about the odds of being discovered by the game warden and thrown into the lake for the swans to conceal. She raised herself slowly to the doorknob, attempting to quietly maneuver herself upward, when a thud and shatter sounded to her side. “No,” she whispered. Every part of her winced, then ironed out quietly. She expected a rush of footsteps into the kitchen at any moment. Off-balance, she tried to place her weight back onto the balls of her feet. She planted her hand down onto the ground to steady herself, but was met with a cornering, sharp pain. Feeling one hand with the other, she extracted a chunk of what felt like glass or porcelain from her palm, and smaller pieces from her wrist. Her hand was covered in whatever the object had contained, though she couldn’t tell whether the wetness was from some kind of syrup, preserves, or her own blood. She raised her hand shakily to her nose in an attempt to smell it, but it was as if her senses had been shut off. Imagination, Ann came to realize, was difficult to control when laced not just with darkness but also pain; in an attempt to quell it, she held her hand to her mouth and sucked. Her skin tasted sour, like brine, and warm, perhaps like blood, which didn’t ease her mind at all. Should she open the door? She no longer feared being caught. After all, she wasn’t a threatening home invader; she simply needed help. Yes! she thought excitedly... she could leave the pantry and, if caught, pretend she had just entered the kitchen—she could tell the game warden that she had seen his property from the forest and didn’t know whether she could make it back to her house in time and was merely looking for a sink to wash the wound... For the first time in what felt like weeks, Ann’s insides matched her environment. It was not only Elgar; the world, too, was imperceptible, completely impenetrable, and difficult to trust. The slosh of her mental activity rose and became the pantry around her. It was true: the doors of hell were locked from the inside. Her muscles relaxed. She leaned slack against the door and closed her eyes. In the distance, she heard footsteps again, a rustle, and then the closing of the front door. Ann was finally free, and she didn’t bring herself to move.

        "story": "At the time of the adman’s death, Gary Minihan had been with the Postal Service for thirty-five years. He spent the first thirty as a letter carrier in Abington, Pennsylvania, where his pragmatic father, who also carried mail, had persuaded him to take what was meant to be a temporary job at the age of twenty-two, after Gary had quit junior college for the second time. That was 1980. A first-class stamp cost fifteen cents. They gave him a walking route that included Paperbark Avenue, where he had lived as a teenager and where his parents still resided. He hoofed the blocks, kept the mail dry, and sweated in all weather—Gary had always been a large man. He did not like the work. He intended, always, to quit, at the end of this year or the next one. He imagined becoming a writer of some sort, of speeches or magazine articles. He brought his customers bills, catalogues, and greeting cards. At Christmas, they gave him Scotch and shortbread. He ate lunch at his parents’ house and sometimes showered there when he got off work, even after he married and moved to Bucks County. As the years passed, the homes on his route were bought and sold, families moved in and out, children grew up and new children replaced them. The older people died, his parents included. In time he stopped thinking of the house on Paperbark as theirs, since the mail he dropped in the letter box no longer bore their names. He ate his lunch in his truck. By 2010, Gary was still a young man—too young, at least, to retire—but he was diabetic and his hips were shot. A friend with more political sense who had worked his way up at the Philadelphia district building found Gary a spot managing the small storefront post office in Kilntown, tucked away in a strip mall off Bethlehem Pike, between the Firstrust Bank and a hair salon. Such things were not usually done, Gary liked to point out. At the United States Postal Service, there were outdoor people and indoor people, and it was rare for an outdoor person to be invited inside. Gary’s new title was postmaster. Technically, he was the interim postmaster, which did not pay as well as a proper postmaster, but the job was his until he maxed out his pension. Kilntown did not offer mail delivery, only three hundred and ten P.O.boxes. These were rented primarily by small-business owners and a few wealthy people from Chestnut Hill who felt their post office was not well run. Gary had two clerks to assist him. Marla Towey was in her late thirties, with two children and an ex-husband who worked for SEPTA. She could not stay past two-thirty in the afternoon because she needed to be home when her kids got off the school bus, and she lived all the way in Drexel Hill. Alondra Robles was ten years younger than Marla. She had three children, the smallest of whom was the daughter of a man she sometimes called her boyfriend but more often spoke of as though he were a chronic medical condition. Alondra also suffered from lupus. Marla had a herniated disc. The P.O.boxes were in the outer lobby, which was accessible to the public twenty-four hours a day. Members of the local homeless population could sometimes be found sleeping there in cold weather. The business window was in the inner lobby, which was locked up every night, and behind it lay the work floor where the employees spent their days. Things were busiest around eleven o’clock, when a line of ten or so customers would assemble before the window to buy stamps or mail packages. Monday was the most hectic, Tuesday the calmest. Often an hour would go by in which only one or two people came through the door. Gary manned the window on days when both Marla and Alondra were off or out sick. When one of them was in, he sat in the back, where, besides placing the presorted mail in the boxes after it was delivered in the morning and gathering it to be picked up in the evening, there was never very much to do.  The downtime proved an adjustment. All of Gary’s working life, for ten hours a day, there had been something to march toward—this house and then that house, the next block and the one after. Now he spent most of the day sitting in the closet-size office at the back of the work floor, and hours passed in which he could not say that he accomplished anything at all. “You’re looking at this all wrong,” said Chuck Feeney, his friend at the Philadelphia district building, when Gary called him at the end of his first week. “It’s a low-traffic store. Basically runs itself.” “That’s the thing,” said Gary. “What do I do while it runs itself?” “Got a library card?” asked Chuck. “Got a Kindle?” The next day, Gary brought to work the first volume of Robert Caro’s Lyndon Johnson biography, which he had bought not long after he was hired as a letter carrier but had never gotten around to reading. In his first attempt at junior college, Gary had been a political-science major. In his second attempt, he had tried business administration, though it had never been a subject that excited him. His daughter, Caitlin, had graduated from Cabrini College with a degree in communications. Gary had always imagined she would go to a more prestigious school, but Cabrini had given her a field-hockey scholarship, and he could not complain about that. He sat down to read the biography after loading the mailboxes and making sure Alondra was all right at the window. The volume was nine hundred and sixty pages long. Gary read four of them before he felt his attention waver. He could hear Alondra at the window, agitated with someone. She hung up her phone as Gary stepped out of the office. “How’s Jeff?” he asked her. Jeff was Alondra’s sometime boyfriend. “Gary, you know I don’t want to hear that name ever again.” Alondra was on her feet, leaning forward against the counter. Her lupus caused her joints to cramp if she sat in a chair for too long. “That was my mother. Lucas is throwing up everywhere.” Gary couldn’t remember if Lucas was the oldest child or the middle one. The youngest, he knew, was a girl named Jada. “Poor guy. Lucky he’s got his grandma. I used to drop my kids off with my mom when they were sick. Grandmas make the best doctors.” “You know, Lucas is in first grade next year,” said Alondra. “Am I gonna be able to leave at two-thirty like Marla does?” “I don’t think we can have both clerks leave early every day,” said Gary. “We need to keep the window open till four-thirty.” “Why does Marla get to leave early?” Gary did not have a satisfying answer. Marla’s special dispensation was a holdover from the previous postmaster. Gary had not wanted to do anything to upset the order of things. Neither he nor his wife, Claire, who worked as a bookkeeper for a screw and bolt manufacturer, had ever been there when the children got home from school. Their kids had gone to a neighbor’s house until they were old enough to watch themselves. But maybe Marla didn’t have any neighbors who could watch her kids for two hours. “Why don’t you run home and check on him, if you’re worried,” suggested Gary. Alondra lived twenty minutes away, in Olney. “But you gotta come back after lunch if he’s not too bad. All right?” With Alondra gone, Gary took her place at the window, the Johnson biography spread open on the counter before him. Through the wide glass storefront, he had an unobstructed view of a construction crew digging up the thin strip of lawn next to the McDonald’s across the parking lot. There must have been a pipe that needed fixing. The hole was deep enough that the man standing in it was visible only from the waist up. The other men lingered around the rim, paunchy in their sweat-stained T-shirts. For thirty years, people had said to Gary, “At least you’re getting exercise,” even as he stood before them in all his heaviness, growing wider by the season. It was a hot day for early May, with the sort of heat that a person walking in and out of buildings might mistake for beautiful weather. Anyone who had to dig a ditch would never mistake a hot day for anything other than what it was. Alondra did not return that afternoon, nor did she call. Back when Gary told Claire he would have two clerks working under him, his wife laughed. “I’m sorry, Gar,” she said, seeing the expression he must have made. “I just can’t picture you managing people.” Gary had been at Kilntown for more than four years when the adman stopped in for the first time. He had read all four volumes of Caro’s Johnson biography—he finished the final volume the same week it was released—as well as books about John Adams, Ulysses S.Grant, and Harry S.Truman. So far that summer, he had read about the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chicago World’s Fair, and the Lewis and Clark expedition. He was halfway through a history of the Panama Canal when Marla told him there was a man at the window who wanted to buy ten thousand dollars’ worth of stamps. The Kilntown post office sold plenty of stamps, but most customers bought only a book or two at a time. A few local businesses purchased them by the roll. Sometimes the nuns from the Sisters of St.Joseph came to stock the mail room at the senior-living facility they operated on Wissahickon Avenue. It was always a pair of them, Sister Mary Elizabeth and Sister Agnes Marie, neither younger than eighty. They would arrive with a check for some arbitrary figure—ninety-six dollars and eleven cents, say—and the value of the stamps Gary sold them had to equal that amount, not one penny more or less. He would invite the nuns to sit with him at the table in his office as he counted out one- and two- and additional-ounce stamps, three- and five- and ten-cent stamps, fumbling with the math on an old RadioShack calculator. He felt like he was back in elementary school, with the nuns staring at him through the glare of their spectacles, embarrassed that he could not do the sums in his head, but he was responsible for every dollar exchanged in the building, and he did not trust himself to get the numbers right on his own. “Now, this check isn’t going to bounce, is it, ladies?” Gary would tease. “The Sisters of Mercy were in here the other week and warned me about you St.Joe’s girls.” Sister Mary Elizabeth would protest playfully whenever he said things like that, but Sister Agnes Marie never cracked a smile. Gary stepped out of the office to see who it was who wanted ten thousand dollars’ worth of stamps. A man stood across the counter from Marla in a loud blue suit with no tie. His face was flushed from the summer heat. It was July. The lobby was decked in patriotic bunting. In the years since he had been at the Kilntown Post Office, Gary had come to think of himself as its proprietor, and he did what he could to make the store a more inviting space. He tried to keep the walls and counters neat, and he decorated for holidays, even the minor ones. All year long, he played music—Bill Evans, Stan Getz, things like that—using the iHome Caitlin had bought him several birthdays ago. Alondra said the jazz made her sleepy and asked if she could pick what was played on alternating days. Gary told her that, unfortunately, only the postmaster was authorized to select the music. The jazz made the post office feel like a café, he thought, even if no one hung out there except himself and the clerks. He had looked into putting a Keurig machine in the lobby, but he was told by his supervisor downtown that it was a potential safety hazard to have customers making coffee. Instead, he bought one for the employees to use in the back. He discovered after ordering it that Marla did not consume caffeine and Alondra drank only Diet Coke. Gary invited the adman to sit in his office, at the table where he hosted the nuns. The office was not as orderly as the lobby—books and papers cluttered every surface—but Gary thought it was charming in its own way, like the study of a disorganized but respected professor. Only the table was kept clear, because it was needed to get the money together at the end of the day. “I like that music you’ve got playing out there,” said the man. He reminded Gary of someone, though Gary could not say who. “I think that’s McCoy Tyner,” said Gary. The man asked what the song was called, but Gary didn’t know. “I’ve just got them all on a playlist.” The adman’s name was Jeremy Krukoski. He needed two hundred rolls of first-class stamps. “We don’t keep nearly that amount of stock in the store,” explained Gary. “I can order it for you, but we don’t keep that much lying around. That’s a hell of a lot of stamps.” Jeremy worked in print advertising. He had business with Bausch+Lomb, the contact-lens people. Targeted mailings, postcards with discount deals, that sort of thing. Jeremy had asked an optometrist for his client list, only to learn that it was illegal for doctors to share such information. Patient confidentiality and what have you. Jeremy had the idea, then, of sending optometrists packs of the postcards pre-stamped, with the address line left blank. He took one out of his pocket and showed it to Gary. “The optometrist just has to fill them out with his patient’s information and drop them in the mail. Bausch and Lomb makes money, the optometrist makes money, the customer gets cheaper lenses, and I look like I know what the hell I’m doing. Everybody gets theirs.” Gary inspected the card. Fifteen percent off a year’s supply of contact lenses. Claire wore contact lenses, but Gary didn’t need them. His eyes were about the only parts of him that worked as well as they ever had. “Everybody gets theirs,” Gary repeated. As he said, he could certainly order the stamps for Jeremy. The turnaround would be about a week. “I knew you could help me. Soon as you came out there, I thought, Here’s the guy I should be talking to.” Jeremy took in the stacks of books around the office. “You writing a dissertation or something?” “Just like to read,” said Gary. “This place basically runs itself.” “Sounds like a dream. With me it’s go, go, go, all the time. Nights, weekends. My doctor told me I should meditate. I said to him, ‘Where the hell am I gonna meditate? On the Schuylkill Expressway?’” “You’re young,” said Gary. “Things settle down. They did for me at least.” “Hell, they’d better,” said Jeremy. “I got little kids, so that’s part of it.” “That’s part of it,” agreed Gary. “It’s a busy time of life. I have two, grown up now. It’s like they were never in the house in the first place.” “That’s what I’m waiting for,” said Jeremy. “‘A busy time of life.’ I like that. I feel that, you know? So which of these should I read first, once my kids go off to college?” Gary eased the Truman book out from under three others balanced on top of it. “Here’s a regular guy who ended up becoming president. Sold men’s clothing, originally.” “No shit?” Jeremy stared at the cover for a moment. It seemed as though he was going to ask a question about it, but instead he said, “We’ll be doing a lot of business. It’s Gary, right? Lot of business, Gary. You get a bonus for moving stamps?” Gary did not. “Well, you’re gonna move a lot of stamps regardless. Enough that we should probably talk about discounts.” After the adman left, Gary sat thinking of his son, Colin. Colin worked in computers—medical software, something like that. He lived in Madison, Wisconsin, with a woman who did the same thing. Gary had asked him if he figured they would get married, but Colin said he didn’t think so. Gary and Colin spoke every couple of weeks, whenever something needed to be said. Gary would usually tell him about the book he was reading, how Truman had done this or that. Colin listened, but Gary could tell he wasn’t very interested. “You know, Truman was almost assassinated by Puerto Rican nationalists,” Gary would say, and Colin would respond with, “That’s great. Listen, Dad, I got this thing I gotta get to...” When the window shuttered at four-thirty, Marla sat in Gary’s office as he closed out her drawer. Gary saw more of Marla in the summer, when her kids were out of school. That summer, her favorite conversation topic was her cousin, who flipped houses in the city. “You should see these places. Real shitholes. You would never think to live there. But he cleans them up and sells them for twice, three times what he paid.” Gary wished she would stop chatting as he added up the money. He counted it once, twice, three times and still came up short. “Marla, you’re missing a hundred dollars,” he said, doing his best not to sound accusatory. Marla stared at him as though he hadn’t said anything. “You sold a hundred-dollar money order,” he said, looking over the receipts. “Where’s the hundred?” “It’s in there,” said Marla. “It isn’t in there?” Gary counted a fourth time. He had never had a drawer short one hundred dollars before. The money went out with the mail on the evening truck. If it was short even one dollar, he would get a phone call in the morning. They looked for things like that, the people downtown. “A hundred is a lot, Marla,” said Gary. “That’s a lot of money to lose.” “I didn’t take it,” said Marla. “I didn’t say you took it. Maybe go look around the counter and see if you misplaced it?” Marla returned empty-handed, her face crumpled like she might start to cry. In his first few years with the post office, when Gary had made less money, he took a second job delivering pizzas at night. They had just bought the house in Bucks County and Claire was pregnant with Caitlin. A week into the pizza job, he misplaced a twenty—dropped it on the street, probably, trying to stuff it in his pocket—and the manager, a real bloodless son of a bitch five years his junior, deducted it from his pay. The guy acted as though Gary had taken it, as if he was not just a thief but a stupid one who hadn’t realized it would be missed. Gary worked the rest of his shift and then made a big show of quitting. He told the manager he’d be waiting for him in the parking lot. He hadn’t actually waited—he had just wanted to scare the kid. Gary had had more of a temper when he was a young man. “It’s all right,” he told Marla. He went to the store’s safe. Alondra often turned in her drawer with more money than it should have had. Four or five dollars over, never too much. Gary reminded her each time that she needed to be better about giving people the correct change, and then he placed the extra money in an envelope. On the night Marla’s drawer was short, there were one hundred and eight dollars in the envelope. He counted out a hundred and slipped them into the bank wallet. “You gotta be more careful, Marla. Technically, they can dock your pay for the difference.” “I don’t know what could have happened,” said Marla. The threat of tears had passed. “I must have accidentally given it to somebody. Really what I’m most upset about is that somebody got an extra hundred bucks and didn’t say anything about it. Just decided it was theirs to keep. You can’t trust nobody these days, I swear to God.” “Yeah, you’re welcome,” said Alondra when Gary told her about it the next morning. “I’m the only one making this place any money.” Gary moved a lot of stamps. Over the next five months, Kilntown became the third-most profitable store in the Philadelphia suburbs, behind only Chester and Lansdale—much larger operations—owing solely to Jeremy and his bulk stamp purchases. The higher-ups in the district building allowed Gary to keep three hundred thousand dollars’ worth of stock on hand, a previously unfathomable volume for a tiny walk-in post office. It didn’t mean any extra money for Gary, but even so. “The district manager knows your name, Gary,” said Chuck Feeney on the other end of the line. “If we’re so important, maybe they can get me one of those ergonomic saddle chairs so I don’t have to deal with this broke-ass stool,” said Alondra when Gary told her about it. He had tried not to sound too self-important as he did. “We have a store budget,” said Gary. “It has to be spent on improvements for the store.” “A new chair isn’t an improvement for the store, but a coffee machine is? Nobody even uses that thing but you, Gary.” Jeremy used the coffee machine. He drank the breakfast blend with three packets of Splenda. He came in every Friday for his stamps, usually dropping thirty-five thousand dollars each time. Gary had been unable to secure him a discount—the Postal Service did not offer discounts on stamps—but the increased stock saved Jeremy from having to place an order and wait a week for it to come through. He acted as though Gary had pulled off a masterstroke of arbitration. “It pays to know a man on the inside,” said Jeremy between sips from his paper cup. “My grandfather taught me that. Worked at traffic court. One of the greatest ticket fixers of the twentieth century.” On such days, Gary would sit nervously with Jeremy’s check until he sent it off on the evening truck. He was plagued by an irrational anxiety, considering that it was simply a piece of paper, easily canceled and replaced if lost. Really, it was Jeremy who should be nervous, driving off with thirty-five thousand dollars’ worth of stamps in his car. But Jeremy never seemed nervous about anything. On the evening of Marla’s accident, Gary left work early for a wake. Mrs.Brown, who had lived on his route for a decade, had passed away from emphysema. She had always been kind to Gary, offering him a drink every time he stepped onto her porch. When he greeted her son at the funeral parlor, Gary told him, “I delivered your mother’s mail for ten years.” He had not expected much of a reaction to this statement, but the son seemed oddly moved by it. He ushered Gary around to his relatives, saying, with a gravity Gary found slightly embarrassing, “This is Gary Minihan. He delivered Ma’s mail for ten years.” Gary was on his way home when he received a call—the first since he had left work—from a man who identified himself as Marla’s ex-husband, Steve. “There’s been an accident on the jobsite,” he said. Gary turned his Hyundai around and headed back to Kilntown. When he got there, a second sedan was idling next to Marla’s in the rear parking lot. A man dressed like a train conductor leaned against the hood smoking a cigarette. Marla lay in the cabin, reclined on the passenger seat. She rolled the window down as Gary walked up to the car. “You all right, Marla? What the hell happened?” “I told you I need a key to the back door, Gary,” she said without looking at him. Gary noticed that she was holding her neck rigid. “I’ve been saying it for years.” Marla had closed up the store, handing off the day’s mail and earnings to the evening driver at five. She then locked the door between the inner and outer lobby, realizing a moment too late that she had left her car keys in Gary’s office. “I must have set them down when I was getting the mail together for the driver. Like you told me to do, Gary.” This shouldn’t have been a problem—Marla merely needed to unlock the door she had just locked—but when she inserted her office key and gave it a twist, the blade snapped off. “It’s in there now. Go on and look at it. The door’s stuck in the locked position. So I was locked outside without my car keys. And I don’t have a key for the back door, and I had to get home to my kids, and I didn’t want to call you, Gary, because you told me you were going to a wake and I didn’t want to be disrespectful.” So Marla did the only reasonable thing, which was to climb through the package window that connected the outer lobby to the work floor. “You went through the package window?” asked Gary. Not in a million years would it have occurred to him to try to crawl through the package window. Not that he could have fit, of course. It was a narrow aperture, about four feet off the ground, where people dropped off packages that already had postage. Just hoisting himself up to it would have been a challenge. “It was the only way in, Gary!” cried Marla, her jaw jerking above her stiff neck. She had tumbled through the window headfirst and landed upside down. Still she had not called Gary, out of respect for the dead. She called Steve. The smoking conductor confirmed the story with a nod. “Jesus Christ,” said Gary. “How did Steve get you out?” “I had to crawl, Gary,” said Marla. “I crawled all the way to the back door, like an invalid. I may be an invalid now.” “Well, go to the hospital,” said Gary. “What are you doing in this car? Call an ambulance.” “We have a doctor we like,” said Steve. He seemed unconcerned by the whole affair. “I’ll take her in the morning.” “I won’t be in tomorrow, Gary, if that isn’t obvious,” said Marla. “You need to call a damn locksmith.” “How’s Marla gonna act so stupid when she’s got a herniated disc?” wondered Alondra the next morning. “Even the homeless people who sleep in the lobby never try to crawl through the package window.” Gary paused as he was loading his coffee pod into the Keurig. The possibility had never occurred to him. If Marla could squeeze through the window, surely a homeless person could. People might be crawling in and out of the window every night, and he would never know. He should probably have a talk with Chuck Feeney. Maybe the union rep too. He didn’t think he was liable for what happened to Marla, but who knew with things like that? “The juiciest aspect of the whole thing is that she called Steve,” continued Alondra. “I bet they’re back at it hard. No way I would call Jeff in that situation. He’d just fuck it all up worse. Plus his license got suspended.” Around two o’clock, Jeremy appeared in the doorway of Gary’s office, sweaty despite the December air. His suit was olive green. Gary was surprised to see him, as it was not a Friday. “We fucked up, Gary,” he panted. “There’s been a misprint emergency.” Gary set aside his John D. Rockefeller biography and gestured for Jeremy to sit. “This guy,” said the adman. “Dr.Vincent Wu—he’s the biggest optometrist in Phoenix. He’s got a fucking empire out there. I spent fifteen grand just on postcards for his clients.” “So?” “So, I misspelled his name. I wrote Vincent Woo, with two os. The cards are useless. I’m out fifteen grand on a fucking spelling mistake.” “We can figure something out,” said Gary. “Some kind of buyback, maybe. These things must happen.” Jeremy’s agitation seemed disproportionate to the severity of the loss. Sure, Gary would be in a panic over fifteen thousand dollars, but he would have guessed it was little more than a rounding error for Jeremy. “Things have been tense at home,” Jeremy admitted, rubbing his temples. “Between you and me, my marriage ain’t in the best shape. Some other ventures haven’t panned out like I thought they would.” He picked up the Rockefeller book and flicked the cover open and shut. “You always keep a calm head, Gary. It makes me calm. You know, I’m thinking that after I get things straight I might expand a little. Maybe I’ll put you on my war council. That’d be something, huh?” Gary agreed that that would be something. Gary had trouble returning to his book after Jeremy left. He kept thinking about the job offer—if that was what Jeremy had meant by war council—wondering whether it was serious. Gary had never intended to spend his entire career with the post office, confident that something else would come along. Most of the carriers he had known were not lifers. They had migrated from other occupations—construction, manufacturing, the Army—or from jobs that didn’t exist anymore. Telephone operators, electrotypers. A couple guys used to build ships at the shuttered Navy Yard. The post office was a decent place to land—job security, pension—but Gary had landed there so early. He remembered the day he realized that, since his raises were based on nothing but his length of service, he could calculate how much he would make every year for the rest of his life. It was a bit like learning the exact height of the sky. Marla went on disability leave. The post office offered fifty-two weeks, and Gary was sure she would take all of them. “So are we getting a new clerk?” asked Alondra. “Tell them to send someone who can count a drawer.” Gary cleared a buyback of Jeremy’s misprinted stock for ninety cents on the dollar. It was standard practice, but Jeremy wanted to celebrate. He had Gary meet him for drinks at the pub just across Bethlehem Pike. Jeremy looked sweatier than at their previous meeting. His tan suit appeared yellow in the dim light of the bar. He told Gary he was drinking Red Bull and vodka, but after the first round—a putrid combination that made his heart race—Gary switched to beer. Gary had never been a big drinker, and was even less of one since the diabetes. He had never been inside this pub, which was more upscale than he had imagined. Suit jackets and cocktails and huge potted ferns. He felt like he was at a wedding reception. Jeremy had put back a few before Gary got there. “The wife’s leaving,” he said by way of explanation. “What can I say? I still like to party. But it’s not a good time for a divorce, money-wise. Really fucking terrible time, right now specifically.” Jeremy ordered another round and sat staring at the sports highlights playing on the television suspended in the corner. “How is there enough time?” he asked. “I look at my kids and I barely recognize them. When I was a kid—well, my dad wasn’t around, but my friends had dads. I saw those dads around. Dads used to be around more, didn’t they? Where did they find the time?” Gary didn’t know. He thought there was a lot of time, almost too much of it. That was how he had read all those books in his office. But it hadn’t always been like that, he supposed. He had lived most of his life in a different time, one that had ended only when he’d stopped carrying mail. “You’re easy to talk to, Gary, you know that?” Jeremy placed a wet palm on Gary’s shoulder. “You remind me of a priest.” Gary chuckled. “A priest for the war council?” “What’s that?” “The war council,” repeated Gary. “Your next venture. You said you’d hire me for the war council.” “Oh, yeah. Yeah,” said Jeremy. It was clear from his expression that he hadn’t thought about it since he had said it. “If I could give you a job, Gary, I would. Maybe for the next thing. This Bausch and Lomb thing was a bust. Didn’t go at all like I expected. But when I figure out the next thing, you’ll be the first hire I make.” “To the next thing,” said Gary, tipping his beer. He felt like a rube. What was he doing in that bar? he wondered. He needed to go home. “Orthodontists, maybe,” muttered Jeremy. “Invisalign.” Gary called Jeremy later in the week about returning the stamps. The misprinted postcards needed to be destroyed under postal supervision before a refund could be issued. The call went to voicemail, which was not unusual. Jeremy did not call back that day, which was. He received a call three days later from a man who identified himself as Jeremy’s brother-in-law. Jeremy had been found in the hotel where he was staying, dead of cardiac arrest. The man implied that drugs might have been involved. “We heard your message about the refund.” The man sounded irritated, as though this was not a job he thought should fall to him. “That’s some good news, finally. Jeremy left a lot of debts outstanding. I can put you in touch with the lawyer who’s straightening it all out. How anyone ever trusted that guy with money, I’ll never understand.” Gary had planned to go to the wake. He brought a blazer to wear over his work clothes. It hung in the back of his car all day. But when the time came to turn west onto the turnpike, he found himself driving east toward home. “What happened to the wake?” Claire asked when he walked into the house, his blazer undisturbed on its coat hanger. She was sitting on the couch watching something on her iPad. She wore one of those headsets with a microphone attached, like an air-traffic controller. “I didn’t feel like it,” said Gary. “I thought this was a friend of yours.” “Just a customer. Nobody there would even know who I was.” Claire frowned. “So?” “So? What am I supposed to do, go up to his widow and say, ‘Hi, I sold your husband stamps’?” “I’m sure she’d appreciate the gesture.” “She was divorcing him. She could give a shit about who sold him stamps.” Claire turned back to her tablet. “Supposed to snow tonight,” she said, after a moment. There was a foot on the ground by 5am, when Gary’s supervisor called to say he needed to go in early and shovel the store’s walkway. It fell to the postmaster to ensure that the building was accessible, a responsibility that seemed to Gary, on that particular morning, a profound injustice. Claire warned him not to have a heart attack and fell back asleep. Gary grumbled as he dressed, filled a thermos with coffee, and pulled away from his own unshoveled driveway to risk his life on the roads. The rear lot was a sheet of white. He didn’t bother to locate a space, stopping the Hyundai somewhere near the center and grabbing his shovel from the trunk. He trudged around to the entrance. A plow had cut a path through the main lot, kicking up an extra three-foot hump of snow in front of the post office that Gary would have to get through. The wind had blown a drift two feet up the glass door. Across the parking lot, barely visible in the predawn light, a teenager labored to clear the McDonald’s sidewalk. With that sympathetic scrape echoing off the concrete, Gary lowered his shovel and went to work. The snow was heavy, the six inches closest to the ground dense as wet sand. Once it was on his shovel, Gary had nowhere to put it. If he threw it to the left or the right, it would only become the problem of whoever showed up to dig out the bank or the hair salon. If he tossed it in the parking lot, it would impede traffic. The only spot available was the strip of lawn beside the McDonald’s, where he had seen the men digging a trench that first week in Kilntown. He figured McDonald’s wouldn’t mind a bit of extra snow on their lawn. He would work it out with the teen if it came to that. He went at it slowly, shuffling across the cleared lane and dropping snow on the McDonald’s lawn one shovelful at a time. After the third trip, Gary was sweating beneath his coat. His hips were killing him; his arms and palms were immediately sore. He was too fat, too broken-down. He was fifty-six, but his body felt much older. Too old to be shoveling snow. He didn’t even shovel snow at home—the Zieglers next door had a blower. There was no sound anywhere in the blind morning other than his scraping, the teen’s, and his own gulping breath. He had been a fool to think there would be an early departure, a special dispensation that would excuse him from his work, his real work, before they had gotten everything they needed from his body. He was only—had only ever been—a set of arms and feet, a back to lift and haul. A shoveler. A carrier like his father. A smarter man would have played his hand better. Cut corners, made a fuss, found a scam. He’d lacked the imagination for that. As the sky lightened, the hump grew smaller. His shoulders burned, and the sidewalk gradually cleared. He turned finally to the entrance itself, just as the first SUV pulled up to the McDonald’s drive-through. Gary felt his shovel scrape against the threshold. The drift that had formed against the glass crumbled into a pile of fluffy clods. Then, like some religious visitation, the door opened from within. Gary stood there staring, his shovel laden with snow, as a figure sidled out of the lobby—his lobby, the lobby he had spent the past forty minutes making accessible. It was a woman swaddled in several old coats, her hair greasy beneath a stained knit hat, a hiking backpack slung over her shoulder. She shuffled past Gary without a look or a word, beelining for the road. His grip loosened and the shovel spun, spilling its contents back onto the pavement. Gary watched the woman float silently away down Bethlehem Pike and melt into the wintery day beyond. After catching his breath, he scraped up the last of the snow and went inside to open the store. In March, Gary learned that Marla had been fired. “Faking it,” said Chuck Feeney from the district building. “Faked the whole thing.” “The injury?” asked Gary. He sat in his office with the phone to his ear. “The ex-husband, too, at SEPTA. Said he fell off a platform or something like that. He was out for a year, then applied for permanent disability. Social Security sent an agent to check him out, and not only is he full of shit, but Marla’s full of shit, too. They’re renovating a house together on Baltimore Avenue. The guy saw them hanging Sheetrock. Lifting, carrying, climbing, the whole thing.” “You know, I had my suspicions,” said Gary. “Her story sounded off to me.” “Well Jesus, Gar, don’t say that. There’s gonna be eyes on your shop after this, especially with all that money you’ve been bringing in.” “That’s all over now. The guy died. In fact, we still owe his widow a refund for some misprinted stock. It’s getting shredded tomorrow.” “Probably for the best,” said Chuck. “Too much excitement for a guy like you, Gary, just waiting out the clock. How much longer you got?” “Five years,” said Gary. “I always knew she was a liar,” said Alondra when she heard about Marla. “She’d lie about nothing. Miss ‘I don’t use caffeine,’ then I come in after she’s opened up and like two of my Diet Cokes are missing from the fridge. So, like, who took them, Gary? The Diet Coke fairy?” The next day, Gary drove to the printer in Fort Washington to oversee the destruction of Jeremy’s stamps. A rented shredding truck was set up at the far end of a small industrial park, the useless postcards stacked on a pallet. No snow covered the ground, but it was one of those wet, colorless days in March when it seemed as though the year had already exhausted itself. Two Postal Service representatives—Gary and a woman from the district building downtown—were required to witness the destruction and sign off on the refund. “Who is Dr.Vincent Woo?” asked the woman, examining one of the postcards. She was younger than Gary and wore an expensive-looking scarf atop her suit. He would not have pegged her for a postal worker. “Biggest optometrist in Phoenix,” said Gary. “He oversees a vast empire.” The cheerful man who ran the shredder—he seemed, from the way he spoke and moved, to love his job—let them each throw a few handfuls into the maw of the truck. The cards vanished in a faint purr of dust. “What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever shredded?” Gary asked him. “Five thousand origami cranes,” said the cheerful man. They left it to the man to carry on the destruction while they sat in folding chairs on the near side of the lot. It felt a bit like a tailgate. The woman, Gail, had brought coffee and breakfast sandwiches. They were there for most of the morning, chatting and comparing notes—Gail was a font of gossip about the district building, about Washington, about where things were headed. She took frequent smoke breaks down at the roadside, talking loudly to someone or various someones on her phone. Gary sat by himself and observed the pulverization, thinking, for some reason, of his father. Years before, an elderly woman had come up to Gary at his father’s wake with a letter folded neatly in her hand. She told Gary that, on the very last day that Francis Minihan ever carried mail, he had dropped a copy of the letter into each of the boxes on his route, and she had saved hers because it struck her as such a thoughtful and unexpected gesture. Gary stuck the letter in his suit jacket and read it in his kitchen late that night, thoroughly tired and slightly drunk. In the letter, his father reflected on how much he had enjoyed serving his customers and watching them grow over the years. How the job was hard, but how the people on his mail route were a source of fulfillment. How, when he had started with the post office, a first-class stamp cost only three cents. The last line above his signature read, “It was the pleasure of my working life to be among you.” Francis had never been a talkative man, and Gary was astounded by how well he articulated his thoughts on the page. He was sure it was one of the best things he had ever read in his life. He decided then that when his own final day of carrying the mail arrived, he would do the same thing, for he felt, in that instant, those same things his father had. He would write his own letter and make a copy for every customer and set it in their mailboxes without a word, to let them know that he had been there among them and that it had meant something. Years later, when he was offered the job in Kilntown, the farewell letter was not on his mind. He only remembered it two weeks after he was situated as interim postmaster, and by then the moment had passed. ’s story “New Poets” appeared in the November 2020 issue of Harper’s Magazine.

        "story": "Manny hadn’t opened the blinds in a week. There were too many windows in his brownstone, and he feared paparazzi might be hanging around the block. Though, in all honesty, it wasn’t just that: natural light depressed him too. Always had. He came to life only at sunset, when someone—or, most likely, something: a sensor, an algorithm—turned the streetlights on. Manny had talked about it with Bill Burr once, why Burr was releasing good material for free all the time on his podcast, and Burr had said Manny was an idiot: of course he wasn’t doing it for free. Still. Twitter, a podcast, those were not venues for comedy. Good material was for the stage. Live TV, perhaps. It was for a physical audience, first and foremost. If you couldn’t hear a laugh, the joke was wasted. And as long as you could tell it and hear new people laugh, it was still alive. That’s why comedians before radio, before TV, had been able to sell their jokes to younger performers when they retired. Not everyone had heard them yet. Not that Manny would ever want to buy a joke from someone else, just that that was how it used to be. The business changed all the time. His ex-wife called. She’d been calling once a day since the first scandal (the beating at the Comedy Strip), twice since the second (the marriage proposals), to check on him. Rachel called in the morning, to make sure Manny wasn’t too hungover, and again in the dead of the afternoon (which she knew had always been the worst time of day for him), in an attempt to delay the hour at which he’d start drinking. “I’m not going to quit,” Manny told her. “You know that. I don’t believe in that.” “You don’t believe in sobriety?” “All the AA bullshit. It’s too extreme.” He’d actually started and abandoned a bit about AA years ago. It was based on an actor he’d met at a charity event who’d gone onstage to tell his story and kept repeating he’d been sober “a year—a little over, in fact.” He’d given the audience the exact number of days, and everyone had applauded. Manny had, too (he wasn’t an asshole), but really, as he was clapping, he’d wondered why the number mattered. The way he understood the whole “one day at a time” motto was that every day of sobriety was so excruciating that it didn’t help to think about the future, and yet AA gave you color-coded chips to mark the length of your sobriety, certain anniversaries, and there was a contradiction there, to Manny’s mind. It seemed greedy to want people to know both the endlessness of your pain and how much of that endlessness you’d gone through already. And what did the chips even mean? If you never recovered but were always recovering, if you could slip at any moment and all there was to do was get to the end of a day without drinking and the next morning the clock started all over again, then who cared how long you’d been suffering? You don’t stop Sisyphus to ask how long he’s been doing this business with the stone. Or you could, but there wouldn’t be much to do with his answer. “It’s not like I beat up women when I’m drunk,” he told his ex-wife on the phone. “I know. It’s the timing. It’s making people conflate all the stories,” Rachel said. “I just propose marriage to them,” Manny said. “Apparently.” “Some would argue that’s worse.” “Don’t give in to this shit, Rach. Words hurting more than physical violence. You’re smarter than this.” “I was making a joke.” “Leave the jokes to me.” Why was he being such a dick? It was nice of Rachel to call. Rachel had always been good to him. “I’m sorry,” he said, and he asked about their son. “Has August heard back from Boothe yet?” August would take the bar exam in February. In the meantime, he was interning at Boothe, Bloom and Boghosian in Chicago. He’d been waiting to hear if they’d let him assist in the courtroom on the Delgado trial, which was starting tomorrow. “Still waiting,” Rachel said. “He’s pretty confident they’ll say yes, though.” Where did that confidence come from? Manny wondered. Certainly not from him. And Rachel wasn’t a glass-half-full type either. None of the role models they’d picked for August had been. “Did you tell him I was moving to Chicago for a few months?” Rachel didn’t respond right away. “They still want you to teach there?” “Of course,” Manny said. “They’re reasonable people. They understand the situation is absurd.” Rachel took another second. “I don’t want to tell Auggie anything about Chicago unless you’re absolutely certain you’re going,” she said. Manny thought he shouldn’t have mentioned August. When he did, their conversations started sounding like after-school specials. “He’s twenty-six years old,” Manny said. “He can take it if there’s a change of plans.” Manny and his son hadn’t talked much the past few years. A handful of emails, birthday calls, a couple of strained days around Christmas every year. Rachel was convinced it had to do with the divorce, that August was mad at his father for cheating on her, but Manny wanted to believe his son simply had a life to live. It was so unusual, someone living his own life, not judging the way other people did it. He told Rachel she should stop protecting him so much. “How about you start?” Rachel said. Manny knew all the money he’d put into his son’s education didn’t make him a good father, so he didn’t mention it, but the soundproof walls in the basement so August could play the drums, the martial-arts lessons, the French tutor, all the books he wanted... didn’t that count as protection, too? “Your son is blowing big-shot lawyers to be first row on a fucking murder trial, and you think he needs some kind of psychological preparation before he sees his father?” “It’s a Ponzi-scheme trial,” Rachel said. “Not murder.” “Didn’t the guy’s daughter die too?” “Suicide. Unrelated. And don’t talk about Auggie like that. He’s not blowing anyone. He works very hard.” Manny knew Rachel would’ve hung up on him just a few weeks ago for the “blowing” comment. “All I’m saying is, I’m a fucking cliché,” he said. “Not a monster. There’s a big difference.” “At least he’s on your side in all this,” Rachel said. “Is he?” “He says these women have no case against you.” That was different from being on his side, Manny thought. “What about me breaking Shitlip’s nose?” “Auggie says if Lipschitz doesn’t sue, there’s no reason not to go back to your life.” Manny respected that his son saw the world through a specialized prism. Even if that prism was law. At least it wasn’t social media. August didn’t claim to know everything, the way other kids his age did. He had one area of expertise, he knew to stick to it, and that was perhaps the best you could hope for—for your child to know enough about one thing that they could recognize the things they didn’t know about. It had been hard for Manny, though, to accept his son’s career choice. As an artist, you were supposed to say you didn’t want your kid to follow in your footsteps, it was such a hard and unfair world, so unpredictable, and you didn’t want your baby to suffer and be rejected all the time, the way you had been, etc., but then when your son became a lawyer, you had to wonder where you fucked up, what he saw in you that disgusted him so much. “Still,” Manny said to Rachel. “I think I’ll have to apologize. No way around it.” “I’m sure Auggie would love that,” Rachel said. “I was talking about a public apology.” “Right.” “What would I have to apologize to August for? I cheated on you back then, not him.” “Never mind,” Rachel said. “I misunderstood you. Public apology, yes, that’s a good idea. You’ll have to address the drinking thing, too, for sure. All three women said you drank a lot. Do you have a draft you want me to look at?” Of course he didn’t have a draft. When his agent had first suggested he apologize about Lipschitz, Manny had asked to think about it, and in the time it had taken him to think about it, the women had come forward with their stories of marriage proposals, and now he didn’t know what he was supposed to apologize for. If he wrapped it all up in the same statement, it would add to the confusion. People would also think he’d been violent to the women. His head was exploding. He’d been worried for a week that he had brain cancer and these were the symptoms—frequent headaches, punching guys at comedy clubs. He’d cried a couple of times, too, since the shitstorm had started. In fact, he’d wanted to cry at the Strip when Lipschitz had called him washed-up, a dinosaur. It was because Manny had wanted to cry that he’d punched him. He’d punched him in order not to cry. Maybe crying was a symptom. He tried to chase the cancer thoughts away, like he’d been doing for days. “I don’t have a draft,” he told Rachel. “Michelle keeps telling me the agency has ‘apology specialists’ that can write one for me. I think she’s getting impatient.” “Maybe you should listen to her.” “I don’t want anyone to ever write anything on my behalf. And I’m okay apologizing for the punch. It’s the marriage proposals that I’m not apologizing for. That shit’s ridiculous. Also, I didn’t propose. I didn’t say, ‘Will you marry me?’ I don’t think I said that. I probably said, ‘Maybe we should get married.’ That’s what I usually say. As you may recall. ‘Maybe we should get married’ is very different. You’re the first person I said it to who took it seriously, by the way. Everyone does now. Everyone’s so fucking serious. You were ahead of your time.” “Don’t be an asshole,” Rachel said. “Don’t pretend you were joking when you proposed to me.” “You’ll never know.” He promised her he wouldn’t drink until he had a draft of an apology, and that he would send it to her. “I’ll show it to Auggie then,” Rachel said. “If that’s okay.” What could Manny say? August would have to see it anyway. “Brilliant,” he said. “We can work on it as a family. Create new memories.” They hung up. Manny opened Word on his computer. He’d judged all public apologies so harshly before, the same words for everyone. Now it was his turn, and he couldn’t find better ones. The problem was, he had to keep it bland, he thought. You couldn’t be funny in an apology, or try to be clever. Apologies had become mere phatic functions of language, automatic responses no one really paid attention to, or noticed, unless they never came. Dullness was the goal. The reader/witness of the apology had to forget that the apologizer was a real person, and apologizing a hard thing to do. Manny wrote: I’m an idiot, have always been an idiot. He wrote about his childhood, how hard it had been, and how he realized that the amount of anger he carried was perhaps a form of disease. He struck the word “disease.” Claiming a disease was making excuses, not apologizing. The key was for people to come out of this thinking he had a disease without him having to say the word. Which should be easy to do, he thought. Everyone saw diseases everywhere now. Everyone was sick. He’d tried to convince August, on his law school applications, to check the “disability” box, because August had a very high IQ, and Manny thought hyperintelligence should be considered a mental illness. He wrote about August and Rachel, how much he loved them, and how sorry he was to have brought shame onto them. He wrote about Lipschitz, of course, though he’d learned from reading other apologies that it was better not to go into much detail there, when it came to your victim. He stuck to the words “promising” and “talented,” even though Lipschitz had never made him laugh, and he insisted that there was never any excuse for violence, even though he didn’t believe that was true either. Manny knew the draft was far from clean, but he wanted to start drinking, so he sent it to Rachel. That’s when he saw Ashbee’s email advertising the MFA students’ stand-up showcase at the Empty Bottle that night. He scrolled down to the attached flyer, expecting to see a group picture, what his future students looked like, but the illustration was only of a microphone, of course—it always was when the comedians weren’t famous: a microphone in a spotlight. He called Ashbee (to make fun of the flyer, he told himself, but really to ensure that he was still wanted in Ashbee’s school, that some people still liked him), and regretted it right away. He’d never much liked Ashbee. When he’d heard about Ashbee starting up a graduate comedy program twelve or so years before, Manny had first thought it was a joke (it would’ve been Ashbee’s best), but then when different sources had confirmed it wasn’t, he’d understood it might’ve been Ashbee’s true calling, teaching what he couldn’t do but had spent his life attempting. When Ashbee picked up, Manny pretended he was only calling to ask for Dorothy’s number. He hadn’t talked to her in ages, and she was going to be his colleague now, too. “I can give you Dorothy’s number, sure,” Ashbee said. “I can give you Ben Kruger’s as well. He’s also working with us now, you know?”  “Only Dorothy’s will be fine,” Manny said. “Right,” Ashbee said. “Only Dorothy’s. Dorothy, you care about. Kruger can go through your secretary.” “Correct.” Manny didn’t want to riff, but he was the one calling—he had to give Ashbee a little something. He asked the standard questions, how the semester was going, whether teaching comedy left him any time to write. “We haven’t seen a new Ashbee show in a while,” he added. “Not sure that’s what the world needs right now,” Ashbee said. “Another middle-aged man ranting about his experience as a middle-aged man.” “Except you’re a black middle-aged man,” Manny said. “I don’t know about needs, but the world definitely wants to hear what you have to say.” “I guess I just don’t want to partake,” Ashbee said. “I’m not much into all that stuff. I’m selfish at heart. I’ve never wanted to speak for anyone other than myself.” They exchanged banalities about writing, how speaking for oneself was the only thing one could do in the end, one’s best shot at universality, etc. Ashbee said something about animal memes. He had a theory that, soon, comedians would only joke about other species if they wanted to stay clear of scandal. After that, it would simply be a question of time before people started getting offended on behalf of the animals in question, but still, there was a window there for now. With animals. Ashbee said that people recognized themselves in animals. You just had to look at the most popular memes on the internet. Like the swan meme, the swan at the party. Did Manny know what he was talking about? Manny didn’t. He didn’t follow the animal memes. “I’ll send you a link,” Ashbee said, and a few minutes later, he did. He sent Manny a link to an essay about memes too. Manny wasn’t a reader of essays. Would he have to read essays now? On comedy? Would that be asked of him now that he was going to teach stand-up classes? He dialed Dorothy. No response. Hearing her voice on the voicemail greeting, Manny realized he couldn’t quite match a face to it anymore. He’d spent three or so years with her in the Nineties closing every cheap bar in the West Village, and they’d slept together too, a handful of times, he’d seen all her shows, but he couldn’t remember anything specific about her features. He didn’t pay a lot of attention to faces. He’d even had a hard time distinguishing August from other short, dark-haired boys in kindergarten back in the day. He remembered a lot of things Dorothy had said, though, all of her jokes. His phone rang, but it was only Rachel telling him what he already knew, that his apology needed a lot more work. Manny promised he’d draft something else right away and poured himself another bourbon. Contrition came easier this time. Not because of the bourbon, but because he’d just remembered how bad he’d felt one night after Letterman, using a line that wasn’t his but Dorothy’s. He tapped into that old guilt and wrote something decent. Rachel said that the new draft was better, more heartfelt. That she would send it to Auggie for legal advice. Manny asked his ex-wife if they called their son Auggie at work, or August. She said everyone called him Auggie, even clients. “It’s a shame,” Manny said. “We gave him such a good name. August Reinhardt. He could have been a novelist with that name. An astronaut.” “Auggie Reinhardt is nice, too,” Rachel said. “It has a nice ring.” “It sounds like he’ll only ever defend small-time crooks.” Rachel said small-time crooks needed defending, too. She was meeting a friend and had to go, she added, and Manny realized jazz music had been playing in the background this whole time, that Rachel might have been getting ready for a date while giving him career advice. When they hung up, he tried to remember when he’d last gone out for fun and couldn’t. He hadn’t seen anyone in days. Even food deliveries were left on his doorstep. All contact with the outside world was mediated through the phone in his hand, that black rectangle that suddenly reminded Manny of the monolith in Kubrick’s 2001. It was the same black, wasn’t it? Shiny and opaque. Malevolent. He felt as lonely as he had in the hospital, when August was sick as a baby. That feeling he’d had back then that he would never again be anywhere else. That life would go on for others outside the hospital, but not for him, and not for August, that hospital time would be their time from now on, the entirety of it, their lifetime. Remembering this, he felt his heart compress, a sponge being squeezed. Was he having a heart attack? Was it cancer? Was it just sadness? Maybe he was lonely, Manny thought. Maybe that was it. What did lonely people do? They read books, he thought. He should read something. He read the essay Ashbee sent, about memes. Meme writers were even less understandable to Manny than comedians on Twitter. At least comedians on Twitter were trying to get something out of their posts, expand their following or whatever, generate buzz, while meme writers ... these people didn’t even want credit. That made no sense to Manny. No sense at all. Although anonymity was the best way not to have anyone mess with you if your joke didn’t land. That was unfair, Manny thought. If you had the guts to show your face, you got in trouble. But if you gave up on putting your name out there, you could make any joke you wanted, unsavory, downright appalling, even not funny at all: the joke would find its audience, and no one would ever wonder whether the person who’d made it had been allowed to make it. No one cared who they were. What comic didn’t want the world to know that a good joke was his? Manny never believed people (people like Rachel) who said they didn’t want to be famous, that all they needed was for their work to be recognized in the very small circle that mattered. They said they didn’t want to lose control over their image, that fame was toxic, and fame was toxic, yes, people knew too much about you, people knew too much about him, especially, right this minute, but if he was being honest, wasn’t it better than them not knowing anything at all? Than them not even knowing his name? Wasn’t everyone knowing what a shitty person he was better than having to introduce himself to new people all the time? Introducing yourself sucked. Starting from scratch. Figuring out what to put forth, what lies to tell. Of course he was ashamed that everyone with an internet connection knew he slept with women thirty years his junior and became an idiot who brought up marriage after too many drinks, but he would be ashamed anyway, famous or not—shame had always been his motor, what kept him writing. He’d always written to erase previous shameful stuff with new material, new material he became ashamed of after he toured it long enough, and so on and so forth. That was the cycle he’d been in for decades, so what if he was ashamed on a grander scale now? Maybe it would get him to a new level, writing-wise. He’d been stuck on the same plateau for years. He’d been stuck at home, too, for more than a week now, with the blinds drawn, because he’d been told to lie low, that was what one did in his situation, but really, he was keen to show himself again, and maybe he should get back into the world right this instant, not listen to what others recommended. It was his life, and he didn’t want to hide. Manny wanted to be seen. It wasn’t purely selfish—he wanted to see others, too, and not just the front they presented to the world but who they really were. Meet young comedians. He wanted to know their fears, their favorite jokes, what kept them up at night. He wanted to see his son. He looked up flight times to Chicago. He could be there in five hours if he left his apartment in the next few minutes. Arrive at O’Hare at 10:02 pm. August worked late. They’d have a drink together. They’d talk. Manny booked his ticket. Somewhere over Pennsylvania, the Wi-Fi stopped working. The flight attendants apologized for the inconvenience, but they didn’t mean it. How many times had Manny, as a young dad, had to tell August that he was sorry about something he wasn’t responsible for? “I’m so sorry Cassie doesn’t want to be your friend, kiddo.” “I’m sorry you forgot your book on the bus.” “I’m sorry your sweater itches.” How was any of it his fault? Though, well, in the grand scheme of things, yes: All his fault. For making August in the first place. Every single one of August’s bad days would be on him and Rachel, in a way. Perhaps August had gone through most of the bad days he would ever have, though, perhaps he’d piled up the bulk of his allotted share in infancy. Just a few days old, he’d been diagnosed with Hirschsprung’s disease. Curable, but tricky. Baby August couldn’t shit on his own. The latter part of his intestine wouldn’t contract, wouldn’t spasm the shit along and propel it forward (downward?), so it all remained stuck up there and you had to go get it with a tube and a pump. For a year they’d done that, Rachel and Manny, in turns, manually pulling the shit out of their infant son, until he was old enough for surgery. Rachel had worried that that year of enemas would scar August forever, psychologically, and the many months of colostomy bags after that, but the boy had grown up well-adjusted, all things considered. Manny had phoned him to let him know he’d be in Chicago in a few hours, but the call had gone straight to voicemail. He’d left a message inviting him to meet for a beer at the Empty Bottle. He was trying to convince himself that showing up at the comedy club to meet his future students would make him look good. It could make him look good to August, in any case. A teacher caring for his students. Manny tried to picture it, but it didn’t make much sense. Him, a teacher? He hadn’t thought this thing through when Ashbee had offered him the job. What was expected of him, exactly? Was he just supposed to sit through the kids’ bad jokes and give them feedback? Was that the idea? Or was it more of a lecture-type thing? He took out his notebook and decided to write down everything he’d learned in almost forty years of stand-up. He thought it would take a while, but after ten minutes, he only had this, and not much more to add: notes for class Manny asked the flight attendant for another beer, which she brought over without a smile. He’d thought at first that the lack of smiling was due to her recognizing and disapproving of him, but she treated everyone else the same way. There were jokes to be made about flight attendants, he thought, how in the past few years they’d ceased to be nice or pretty, same as nurses (before World WarII, flight attendants had been nurses, he’d read somewhere), how those once sexually charged professions had evolved to become regular jobs, held by women who looked like your mother. But such jokes could never be made in the current climate. And that was a good thing, Manny thought. As dreary as political correctness was for comedy, with all the new fences built around forbidden topics, it went both ways: people were deprived of potentially great jokes, but also spared terrible ones, sexist or otherwise. Sexist jokes still existed, of course, but comedians had to put extra thought into them now. They had to be worth the trouble their authors would get into, and so they tended to be funnier. Not that it mattered, in Manny’s case. Sexist jokes, even good ones, would not be welcome from him ever again. No matter how the rest of his days unfolded, there would always be a vague aura of scandal about him. People would remember hearing something about Manny Reinhardt and younger women—harassment, perhaps, something sexual, certainly. Manny didn’t have sexist jokes in the bits he was working on, and he hadn’t planned to write any, but the realization that he could never make one again bothered him. What if he found the model joke, the sexist joke to end all others? What would he do with it? There was nothing personal when he made a sexist joke, nothing against his ex-wife, his sister, his nieces, or his mother. To Manny’s mind, all jokes existed in the form of embryonic blobs in the air—they were the thoughts people exuded and rejected all day, and his job as a comedian was to grab onto the most horrible of these thoughts, shape them right, and serve them back to those who’d run away from them. He was in the business of finishing people’s horrible thoughts so they didn’t have to go there themselves. A dirty job, but as long as people thought horrible thoughts (and they would never stop thinking them, no matter how hard they pretended), someone would have to do it. He didn’t always enjoy it. Sometimes, he didn’t want to go where he went. Often, he disgusted himself for going there. But if he didn’t say things that shocked even himself, then he was failing, then he wasn’t doing his job right. Right? He needed to be a little uncomfortable, the audience needed to be a little uncomfortable. If they never were, if they were always in agreement with what Manny said, then it meant Manny hadn’t gone far enough, hadn’t handed them a clean enough mirror. He didn’t understand people who went to a comedy club, or to a movie, or to the theater, to feel good about themselves. Most people weren’t good. Didn’t they want to hear from someone else who wasn’t? Maybe he could sell his future sexist jokes, Manny thought, if future sexist jokes came along. He’d never sold a joke before, but he knew people who did. He could sell his sexist jokes to female comedians, to Dorothy, for example. Dorothy would be allowed to make them. He could sell racist jokes to black comedians. What would be left for him, though, if he sold all his offensive jokes to people who were allowed to make them? He could still joke about alcoholics, Manny thought, his father having been part of that community, he himself verging on membership. He could keep anti-Semitic jokes. Jokes about rich people. About Hollywood. Ugh. He crushed his empty beer can and gestured to the stewardess for a third. He couldn’t tell if anyone recognized him on the plane. He’d jumped from the cab to the airport’s express security line to the Admirals Club lounge to the plane’s first-class cabin without anyone bothering him. Rich people tended not to bother celebrities, though. Rich people didn’t even look at celebrities, whereas Manny knew that if he so much as walked across coach now, two or three guys would stop him to chat, ten would stare, twenty others would badly pretend not to stare. He’d wondered what it was with rich people, if they went through rich-people training once they’d amassed a certain amount of wealth, an intensive course in which they were taught how to properly eat an ortolan, and to leave celebrities alone because it was déclassé to care about fame. Although he hadn’t been offered that course, and he had to be richer than most people on the plane. He wondered if Ben Kruger was richer than him. That bastard had to have made a lot of money with the Meryl Streep movie. Manny didn’t think he was jealous. He’d been offered movie roles before, had always turned them down. But there was something about Kruger that annoyed him. At first, he’d thought it was the way Kruger looked—his eyes, in particular, which seemed to never fully open or close—but maybe it was bigger than that, the eyes a mere symptom of a larger condition. The neither/nor condition. Neither a bad comedian nor a good one, neither a good actor nor a bad one. Yet people seemed to love it, Kruger’s mediocrity, his in-betweenness. It was real, or whatever they called it. But what was with the teaching? Why had Kruger taken a teaching job? A tenured one, too, not just a visiting position, like the one Manny was accepting. They were probably paying him a lot, but still. Was it a status thing? Could it be that Kruger believed in teaching? His son was the main reason Manny was giving teaching a shot. August had never admired anyone more than his professors at the University of Chicago. Manny had heard him on the phone with his favorite teacher once, when August was home for Christmas after his first semester of law school. He’d heard him laugh harder than he’d ever heard him laugh before. That had hurt a bit. What could a law professor have said that was so funny? He’d wanted to take the phone from August and tell the guy, “I’m the father, I’m the one who didn’t sleep for years thinking the kid might die, who the fuck are you?” He didn’t think about August’s childhood illness that much, to be honest, but hearing him laugh with his professor that day on the phone had brought it all back. It had surprised him to remember it so clearly—the anguish, the smell of the soap they used in the hospital. It had surprised him because the only parts of his life he remembered so vividly tended to be those he’d written about, and he’d never written about August’s condition. He’d promised Rachel back then, when August was a few weeks old, never to use his illness for work, for laughs, never to talk about August onstage, in fact, and he’d kept his word. He’d talked to strangers about the most private and embarrassing things (hemorrhoid treatments, taking his mother off life support), but never August. That was a long time ago, though. When he’d made that promise. August was healthy now, everything had turned out great. Maybe it was time to really put it behind them... maybe now was the perfect time to write about August, about having been August’s father, a parent to a sick child. Yes, forget movies! Manny thought. Movies were boring. They moved like warships. You controlled nothing. What Manny had to do was write an hour of comedy about August’s first years of life, when he and Rachel constantly feared he would die. A comedy special about sick babies! That was the new frontier. That would surprise everyone. Everyone would be expecting a contrite performance from him, tepid jokes about male-female relationships, jokes about how horrible men were, and so on. No one would see the sick-child thing coming! And it would be his story, too. He could never be accused of having no right to tell it. Well, August could accuse him of that, he guessed. Or Rachel. If August was okay with it, though, Rachel would be, too. Big ideas didn’t usually come to Manny like this. His shows tended to build one beat at a time, until he figured out patterns, what the whole thing, unbeknownst to him, had been about. But this, what he was going through now, this was what people referred to as “inspiration.” He could see the whole show. Rachel’s pregnancy, the baby’s first days, the terrifying wait for a diagnosis, the horrible jokes that had come to his mind and that he’d kept to himself. He’d look like a terrible father at times, but also like a great one in the end—he’d taken such good care of August! The show would be hilarious and moving. He could almost see it write itself. In spite of the snow, Manny’s flight landed ahead of schedule. He’d spent the last forty minutes in the air working, writing down memories of Brooklyn Hospital’s pediatric ward, the long hours he’d spent there with Rachel, August, and all those other sick children he’d never asked about. What he had on paper so far wasn’t funny, but it didn’t matter. He just had to let it all out for now, how cold and afraid he’d been (why was it always so cold in hospitals?), how cowardly, how angry at Rachel, at times, for talking to other parents in the hallways, for letting their worry add to her own. Manny had never felt so selfish as when August was sick. Hospitals were places of high contamination, and the fact that the ailments August and other children suffered from were mostly congenital malformations and noncontagious blood diseases was of no comfort to Manny at the time. He was afraid of another type of contamination, of his family’s bad luck piled on by other families’ worse luck. Snowballing. When he saw a deformed kid on the ward, he looked away, didn’t even nod at the parents. He held his breath too. He thought bad luck would travel like bad smells. Manny had been so focused on remembering his son as a newborn that he experienced a moment of unreality when he turned his phone back on and saw a text message from grown-up August, sent an hour earlier: “I’ll meet you at the Empty Bottle.” Manny had almost forgotten about the Empty Bottle, or why he’d come to Chicago in the first place. He wanted to skip it now, skip the whole thing, just check in at the airport Hilton and write all night, like in the good old days. He knew he would have to ask August for permission to use his life story, but if he came to him with an idea of how the show would be structured, the beats, he could make a stronger case. His son would see the thought that had gone into it. He felt bad canceling on August, knew that Rachel would probably give him a hard time about it, but August would understand. He respected hard work. Manny was starting to type his excuse when his son’s next message came: “I’m here.” Manny didn’t let this stop him. He could still tell him he wasn’t feeling well and ask to meet tomorrow instead. “At the bar,” came another message. “With your future students.” Now it was trickier. Now third parties were involved. Parties Manny hadn’t disappointed yet. August had likely told them he would be coming. “They’re already asking for legal advice.” Manny erased the message he’d been working on. “That’s smart,” he replied. “Smart kids. I’ll be there in an hour.” He put his phone back in his pocket and looked for directions to a cab. He made accidental eye contact with a woman who seemed to recognize him, and he pretended to need something from the Hudson News immediately to his right. The woman could’ve been a fan with no interest in his present troubles, but Manny didn’t risk it. He’d been insulted on the street a dozen times since the stories had broken. Mostly about the proposals, only once about punching Lipschitz. Several news outlets had labeled him a predator after one of the three women maintained he’d offered marriage before they’d had sex. Manny was pretty sure he’d said it post-sex, but he didn’t feel like correcting the woman’s story yet. If there ended up being a trial and the timing of the proposals became a pivotal detail, he would give his version, but now, in all honesty, he couldn’t really see the difference it made. Manny thought he could get something for August from Hudson News while he was there. He used to bring him a present from each tour stop back in the day. Toys at first, but then August had started asking for unique things, things that could only be found wherever Manny went. Manny had brought home local papers after that, the Tampa Bay Times, the Bellingham Herald, which August proceeded to read from front page to obits. Rachel had found it cute, how nerdy that was, and how close the boy wanted to be to his dad, going over the news of the towns Manny had been in on the day that he’d been there. Who passed on Legos to read about the weather in Raleigh? she’d marveled. Last week’s weather in Raleigh? What a quirky child they had! It had made Manny uneasy, though. August’s interest in what had happened in those cities was the photo negative of what his own had been, and he’d been there. On tour, he tended to forget where he was. He slept until noon and woke up sad most days not to be in his bed, with Rachel. He saw the long hours before a show as time to kill, not opportunities for discovery. Why was his son so interested in knowing where he’d been? People were the same everywhere. Manny had brought the newspapers as a joke, and his son hadn’t gotten it. People magazine had a starlet on its cover, one who’d been sentenced to hundreds of hours of community service after being caught shoplifting and who was now letting the world know how transformed she’d been by the experience. She’d served her sentence but was still volunteering at a homeless shelter in L.A. Manny wondered if he would have to do something like that, too. His agent had hinted at it, asking if there wasn’t anything they could use to make him look like a good guy. Any volunteer work he did on the side? Of course not. He donated a lot of money to cancer research, though, he’d said. Over the years, he’d probably given a million dollars. He’d been proud to tell Michelle this. He’d never told anyone about it before, not even Rachel. He believed that charity wasn’t something you advertised, that advertising it rendered it worthless. So he was ashamed to realize he’d expected praise from his agent when he’d told her. All she’d said, however, was that it didn’t really count because all Manny had done was give money, and not time. Manny was afraid she’d suggest he visit cancer wards now, make the dying people laugh. He didn’t want to see people with cancer. He’d started giving money to cancer research when Rachel, during one of August’s many hospital stays, had befriended a mother in pediatric oncology. Manny’d never met the woman himself. He’d refused to set foot on the cancer floor. He hadn’t had much money at the time, but he’d begun making small donations to leading research labs: the National Cancer Institute, the Anderson Center, the Curtis Lab. August’s two following surgeries had gone splendidly. Even Rachel’s friend’s son had started doing better, or so Rachel reported. Manny had kept giving. As he gave more, his career took off. August began shitting on his own. Manny kept giving. The more he gave, the more famous he became, and if fame meant touring extensively, being less a part of his child’s life, Manny reasoned it was a way to balance out the intrusiveness he’d been forced into at first, pulling the shit out of August several times a day. It was good to give August some space once he could do everything by himself. Manny cheated on Rachel one night in Ohio and made his first-ever five-figure donation the following day. He never gave less after that. When Rachel started talking about couples’ therapy, he doubled his usual donation. The day their divorce was finalized was the day he gave the most. Since then, he’d kept the donations steady, the same amount twice a year. Maybe he hadn’t given as much as he could have the past few years, and that’s why life was catching up with him. He worried now that Lipschitz and the women’s accusations would only be the beginning. The beginning of a long fall. He hadn’t given anything to cancer research since it had all started. He’d felt the situation demanded something different, something drastic. Perhaps Michelle was right and he ought to forget about money, upgrade to time given to those who suffered. The problem was, no one wanted his time now. No one wanted Manny to spend it on them. Except maybe journalists. There was this journalist who kept asking him for quotes and corroborations. He could give her a few minutes. That would make her day. Maybe he could even tell her about what he was working on, a special about his son’s illness... is that how he would phrase it? He could pretend that he’d already been working on it the night he’d punched Lipschitz. Yes, that was a great idea, Manny thought as he handed the checkout guy a Take5 and a Red Bull. He could tell the journalist how writing about the hardest four years of his life had made him vulnerable, his nerves so very raw. Journalists loved that word. Outside O’Hare, the cabdriver didn’t recognize Manny, but told him about his idea for a TV show anyway. A show about cabdrivers, and all the different kinds of people they met. Like no one else ever had this idea, Manny thought. He didn’t want to be a dick, but it was hard not to judge everyone all the time. Here was the interesting show: a show about a cabdriver with no curiosity for his customers whatsoever. Though maybe it was the same show, in the end, and Manny should relax. He’d chanced upon the best kind of driver. The cabdrivers who told you about how interesting their job was because they got to meet all sorts of people were the ones who never asked you a single question.

        "story": "Years later, my grandmother would still tell people that I learned to swim in a movie star’s pool, though she always said this with the same slanted tone and pinched expression she used when telling people that my mother dated only rocket scientists or that my grandfather was a real Mr. Fix-It around the house, indicating there was significantly more—or rather, less—to the story and leaving me to explain about Gretta Benson-Klein-Huffacher and how she wasn’t really a movie star, just an old lady who hosted a show for other old ladies on public-access television. Gretta had, many years before my family knew her, appeared briefly in a movie, but it was not a feature, only a short educational film for sociology students about the shifting culture of the American West—the crew filmed in Fortune Valley for a single day, and Gretta’s scene had her onscreen for a matter of seconds, shot from behind in a lavender suit and buying a bottle of port from a local winery, though she would later tell us that she had not really purchased the port, but merely gone through the motions of paying for it. “I was acting,” she explained, and waved her hands around her face to demonstrate: acting. “I wouldn’t touch that regional swill with a pig’s lips.” Originally settled as a mining town, Fortune Valley was a high desert surrounded by a ring of great red cliffs that watched over inhabitants like stern but protective guardians. Coal and copper had long been stripped from the surrounding land, but the mild winters, combined with the low cost of living, had over the years made Fortune one of the fastest-growing retirement communities in the Southwest. Like most of her viewers, Gretta had grown up in a more sophisticated part of the country, somewhere flatter and greener and flecked with department stores and steak houses and country clubs (the one in Fortune was a sham, Gretta said—they allowed blue jeans in the dining room). In the nearly twenty years that she hosted Fortune’s Prime, there were few aspects of Gretta’s life that did not unfold in front of the camera. She took her crew with her to the dentist and the doctor’s office, having them film root canals and mammograms and colonoscopies. After her first husband died, she dated and then married her second husband on television, and after his death more than a decade later, she did the same with her third. Of course, when my mother and I knew her, husband number three was still years away, and the summer I learned to swim in her pool, Gretta Benson-Klein-Huffacher was still just Gretta Benson-Klein. I was eleven the year my mother dated Gretta’s son, Lance. She met Lance at church, which was where we met everybody that first year in Fortune. In Chicago, where my mother and I were born, we went to church only a few times a year: Christmas Eve, Easter, the occasional wedding or funeral or baptism. But in Fortune, we went every Sunday, and a good share of weeknights as well. My mother took Bible-study classes on Wednesday nights and met with the member-outreach committee every other Thursday; she performed with the bell choir, which practiced on Mondays; and on Saturday afternoons she cooked casseroles for shut-ins with the Adam’s Rib group. My mother was not an especially good cook or a particularly talented musician. She was soft-spoken and easily flustered, which made her no great asset to any committee, and many years later she would confess to me that she didn’t believe in God and never really had. But that year, the year we moved to Fortune, church was the only place my mother could go when she wanted to get away from my grandparents, and so we went to church all the time. My grandparents had retired to Fortune a few years earlier, and when asked, my mother told people that we followed to be close to family. Really, though, we followed because, after her divorce, my mother was unable to face her friends and acquaintances, and because we had no money. My grandparents took us in because they thought we could use a fresh start and a change of scenery, and because my mother was their only child and I their only grandchild—which is to say, because they had to. My mother disliked Fortune, and she hated living in my grandparents’ house, where she and I shared a small room in the basement, which smelled like cat urine even though my grandparents didn’t own a cat. At night, my mother cried quietly in her bed. “I’m sorry,” she would say if she realized I was still awake. “I just can’t believe this is my life.” “We must try very hard to be patient with your mother,” my grandmother told me. “She’s suffered a terrible disappointment. Disappointment is harder for her than for most people.” My mother was thin and delicate, with pearl-pink skin and hair so fair it was nearly white. All my life, I watched with wonder as strangers stopped her at the supermarket or in line at the bank—men and women alike—to tell her how lovely she was and to compare her to other lovely things (a painting, a princess, a porcelain doll). I took after my father, soft and round with bland brown hair and a slightly protruding lower jaw that was often mistaken for defiance rather than basic bone structure. At church, an older boy named Kenny asked if I was adopted. Kenny was large for his age, with a flat, flabby face and a high, whinnying voice. When I told him I was not, he pointed to my mother and said, loud enough so the other children would hear, “How did a fox like her whelp a dog like you?” My grandmother told me I was lucky not to look like my mother. (“You might have a little sense when you’re older. Your mother never needed it.”) But she also worried that I didn’t care enough about my appearance, that I sometimes forgot to brush my hair or wash my face, that I dribbled ice cream down the front of my shirt and didn’t bother to change into a clean one. Mostly, she worried I would be fat. At church, I hoarded cookies during the social hour between services, sneaking back to the food table as many as five or six times. I tried to move stealthily, out of my grandmother’s sight, but even in a crowd I could not escape her surveillance. Swiping cookies from the platter, I would turn to find her watching from across the church basement. She would hold my gaze as she brought her index finger to the tip of her nose, pushing it up like a pig’s snout. My grandmother thought I could benefit from some of my mother’s self-control—why, when my mother was my age, they’d had to force her to eat! “A woman who cannot control her appetite,” she said, “will know nothing but suffering.” Lance Benson asked my mother on their first date at the Easter market. We’d been learning about the Crucifixion in Sunday school, about how Jesus was dragged through the streets and whipped until his back ran wet with blood. When the Romans nailed Jesus to the cross, our teacher told us, they didn’t hammer spikes through his palms, as all the paintings showed. Instead, they nailed his wrists—through the bones—which was what held him in place for the six hours before he died. My mother assured me there would be no crucifixion at the Easter market, not even a pretend one. Also, she said, there were palm fronds that people could wave and a donkey people could pet. And while I very much wanted to wave a palm frond and pet a donkey, I could not bring myself to step through the double doors of the church basement. So it was only later that I heard how Lance Benson, while buying a raffle ticket from my mother to raise funds for the bell choir, asked if she’d like to come over sometime and swim in the pool. Lance had moved back in with his mother after his stepfather’s stroke. When Gretta married Ed Klein, he’d been Fortune’s top cardiologist, but now he walked with a limp and held one arm at a strange angle. The left side of Ed’s face sagged, his eye wet and runny so that he had to dab it with his good arm. The ladies at church admired Gretta’s strength and her courage and, especially, her tall, handsome son who took out her garbage and shoveled her driveway when it snowed in the winter. It must have been God’s hand that led my mother to Fortune, the old ladies said. Before my mother, no one in town had been good enough for Lance Benson. Gretta, however, was ecstatic about the pairing, proclaiming that my mother and I were now part of the family and insisting I call her Grandma Gretta. My own grandmother did not care for this arrangement. “Until Lance Benson puts a ring on your mother’s finger, you have one grandmother and one grandmother alone.” And though I had another grandmother in Chicago, I nodded and told her, “I know.” Gretta lived in a large house at the edge of the valley, up against the red cliffs. On the days my mother and I spent there, Lance taught me how to paddle from one side of the pool to the other while my mother read magazines and sipped iced tea on a deck chair. Gretta had a herd of Pekingese, all of them named after drinks—Julep and Gimlet and Paloma and Tom Collins—all of them stinky and obese and half blind with cataracts except for the youngest, Mai Tai, who was small and springy, with bright eyes and a coat as soft and white as rabbit fur. Mai Tai was the darling of Ed Klein, who sat all day beside the pool with her on his lap, petting and kissing her and tossing potato chips into the water so that she would dive in, paddle after them, and return, wet and skinny and trembling with joy, to his lap. Ed Klein was also fond of my mother, who would sometimes sit beside him, taking turns throwing chips or Cheetos into the pool for Mai Tai, nodding in unison with Ed as he pet the dog and dabbed his eye and repeated into my mother’s mirrored sunglasses, “Good girl, good girl, good girl.” From the kids at church, I learned that before my mother, Lance Benson had dated the mother of Meg and Marnie Polk, a tall woman with ropy arms and a short, scrubby haircut. My grandmother didn’t care for Beth Polk and her daughters, whom she referred to in private as hicks. I didn’t know what a hick was (we didn’t have them in Chicago), but I understood the general connotation by the way my grandmother said the word—her face twisted as though she had an insect pinched in a tissue. Marnie was my age, with stringy hair and slouchy shoulders and a thin, whispery voice. She sat next to me in the children’s choir, and though we often shared the same sheet music, I never heard more from her than the occasional squeak. Meg was four years older. She wore lipstick and smoked cigarettes in the church parking lot and was dating our minister’s older son, Gabe, which was a source of great concern for many of the congregants, as Meg Polk was not, by and large, the kind of girl that people thought their minister’s son should be dating. Meg and Marnie’s parents had divorced several years prior, but up until recently, their father had attended our church as well. Then, not long before my mother and I moved from Chicago, Meg and Marnie’s father had gotten drunk during one of his visitation weekends and whipped Meg with a switch until she wet her pants. Now, the other kids told me, he didn’t come to church at First Presbyterian, but instead went to AA meetings at United Methodist. According to Tessa Burke, whose older cousin was in school with Meg and had seen her changing clothes for gym class, Meg still had marks from the beating across the backs of her legs. Gretta was especially bothered by the sight of the minister’s son slinking off with Meg Polk at church. “Mike Wilson,” she said, “is on thin ice as it is.” Gretta objected to Pastor Mike’s scruffy beard and to his wearing a muslin robe with a rope belt when he preached on Sundays. She disliked the floral arrangements he approved for the pulpit and the hymns he selected for services and the readings he gave between the offering and benediction, which were not always from Scripture. The Sunday that Pastor Mike played guitar and led the congregation in songs from Godspell, Gretta nearly fell out of her pew. “Presbyterian ministers are doctors, not pastors,” she said in the parking lot, hissing to my grandparents beside their car while my mother and I waited in the back seat. “They’re clean-shaven. They wear a suit and tie. They don’t sit on the sanctuary floor in a tunic and a piece of rope playing guitar like a roadside vagabond!” Gretta wanted my grandparents to join her and a small group of other congregants in a formal complaint to the presbytery. “If we’re together on this,” she said, “they have to listen. We’re the deep pockets at First Pres.” My grandparents sometimes grumbled at home about Pastor Mike: my grandfather didn’t think it would kill him to throw in “The Old Rugged Cross” once in a while, and my grandmother thought his children were hooligans; she’d seen Gabe smirking through catechism and it was known that the younger son, Jeffrey, had twice been suspended from school for fighting. But they were uncomfortable with the idea of making their grievances public. What finally persuaded them to join Gretta and the other Deep Pockets was Pastor Mike’s commission of a new cross to stand at the front of the sanctuary. It was the work of a local artist, a great iron structure that rooted into the floor and towered up toward the ceiling. “That cross is indecent,” my grandmother said over dinner. “It’s not a cross,” my grandfather said. “It’s a crucifix.” “What’s the difference?” I asked. “A cross is a symbol,” my grandfather told me. “A crucifix is a torture device. It should be in a Catholic church. Crucifixes are a Catholic fetish.” “What’s a fetish?” Across the table, my grandmother’s knife scraped against her plate. My mother turned to my grandfather, blinking her pale lashes as we all waited for him to answer. My grandfather cleared his throat and took a bite of mashed potatoes, taking his time to chew and swallow before he told me, “It’s a predilection.” I looked to my grandmother. “It’s an ugly secret,” she said, “that keeps you from getting into heaven.” She reached her fork across the table and removed the second helping of meatloaf I’d snuck onto my plate when I thought no one was looking.  My mother objected to the Deep Pockets. “I want nothing to do with those meetings,” she said when my grandparents invited her to come along. “Barb Wilson is the only friend I have in this town.” “Fine friend,” my grandmother said. “Wife of a hippie, mother of hoodlums.” Pastor Mike’s wife was in the bell choir with my mother and would sometimes have her over at night to play cards. If I went along, I usually watched TV alone in the living room. But one night, midsummer, when my mother and I arrived at the Wilsons’, Barb guided me not to the television but to the basement. Jeff and his friends were downstairs, she said. “You should go play with them.” I looked to my mother in alarm, willing her to stop me, but she only smiled and told me to go ahead. In the basement, Jeffrey Wilson and his friends were sprawled on the floor in their sweatpants and dirty socks, drinking Mountain Dews and playing Nintendo and trying to out-belch one another. I perched on the tattered arm of the sofa, watching in silence. “We should have a war,” one of the boys said. The rest of them began to stir, heads rising, muscles flexing as they stretched and stood and started for their weapons. Jeffrey had a small arsenal of wooden rubber-band guns and boxes upon boxes of rubber bands—the thick kind that left red welts when they struck flesh. Watching the boys stretch the bands to load their pistols and rifles, my heart seized with panic. The door to the stairway was all the way on the other side of the room, and the idea of being, for the time it took to cross the concrete floor, the unshielded center of their attention, filled me with terror. I backed against the wall and shrank to the floor. “Hold your fire!” At the sound of Jeffrey’s voice, his friends lowered their weapons. From my place on the floor, I didn’t realize that he had turned to me. But then he said my name—Katie—and told me, “I’m gonna build you a fort.” Everyone stood and waited while Jeff pulled quilts from a closet, draping them over the backs of chairs and bolstering the structure with cushions from the couch. When he finished, he circled the construction several times, nudging it with the toe of his socked foot and smacking it with the back of his hand until he finally motioned for me to climb inside. “Anyone touches her,” he said, “they’re dead meat.” At my grandmother’s insistence, my mother invited Lance Benson over for dinner. We sat in the dining room rather than at the kitchen table, and my grandmother made fried chicken, which she usually reserved for my or my grandfather’s birthday. My mother picked at her mashed potatoes as my grandfather talked with Lance about the population boom in Fortune Valley and my grandmother asked him about his plans for the rest of the summer. Lance told her there were some trails he wanted to hike and some friends he wanted to catch up with. Mostly, though, he said he wanted to get me to stop being such a baby and swim across the deep end. He reached sideways and tickled me. After dinner, my grandfather fixed bowls of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce for us to eat on the back porch, but my grandmother stopped me at the back door. “I need to talk to you.” “Later,” I told her. “Now,” she said. I followed her to her room, where she closed the door and sat on the bed, patting the bedspread for me to join her. I was annoyed at having been pulled away from my ice cream, and instead of sitting, I climbed on top, jumping up and down in my shoes. “Stop that,” my grandmother said, reaching up and slapping my bare thigh so hard that the crack reverberated through the room. I stopped, stunned. “This is serious,” she hissed, and I sank down beside her. No one had ever hit me before, and I could feel the slap ringing through my body, the heat throbbing from the back of my leg up into my stomach, my rib cage, my throat. “This is very important,” she said. She put her hands on either side of my face, tilting it upward until our eyes met. “Does Lance ever”—she paused, dropping her voice and narrowing her eyes—“touch you?” I didn’t understand the question. Lance touched me all the time. In the pool, he held me from below while I practiced floating on my back or kicking on my stomach. Earlier that evening, he’d tickled me at the dining room table, as my grandmother had seen herself. But there was something in the way she was looking at me that made me feel as though I’d done something terribly wrong. And so I shook my head and whispered, “No.” After the night he made a fort for me in his basement, I found myself tracking Jeff Wilson with my gaze at church, standing beside him in line at choir, following him from a distance when we left the sanctuary midway through the service for Sunday school. Both Jeff and his brother were fair and freckly like their father, but Gabe had a narrow, almost feminine frame, while Jeff was built like brick. I’d heard about his school suspensions for fighting, and whenever I was close to him, I found myself stealing glances at his hands, which were solid and square and chapped at the knuckles. I imagined him slamming his fists into other boys, boys who cried or begged or bent like paper straws when he hit them. Sunday mornings, the church was a forest of smartly dressed adults, smiling, watching, shaking hands, and wagging fingers, and during this time, we children sat beside our parents in itchy tights and clip-on ties, our hands folded and mouths closed. But after it emptied out, the church became our playground, our labyrinth, our empty ship, and we chased one another up and down the hallways, through the rectory and balcony and storage closets, playing hide-and-seek between the empty pews and helping ourselves to stale cookies and communion grape juice from the kitchen. One Sunday, I cheated at hide-and-seek and followed Jeff into the choir closet. He’d tucked himself behind the choir robes so that only his shoes—scuffed brown loafers—showed beneath. When I pushed the robes aside, he looked surprised to have been found so quickly, surprised that the person who found him was me. I waited for him to push past me and return to the group, but he only stood, watching me through his rust-colored eyelashes. The room was dark and smelled of wood polish and mothballs. “Do you want to kiss me?” I asked. He seemed for a moment like he might be considering it. “Nah.” I stared down at his hands, his pink, scaly knuckles. “Do you want to hit me?” His head tilted. “You’re a girl.” “I don’t mind,” I told him. He poked his tongue into the corner of his mouth and took a step closer to me. Then he closed his hand and nudged me with his knuckles, lightly, on the shoulder. We both waited for something to happen, and when nothing did, he lifted his hand, brushing his fingers lightly across my jaw. We watched each other for a moment and then he did it again, slightly harder. This time, I opened my mouth and his index finger hooked in my lip. Without thinking, I bit down, and heard a suck of air through his throat. Before my eyes could register the change in his expression, he pulled his hand away and slapped me so hard that my head whipped sideways. I gasped and lifted one hand to the side of my face, and he covered his mouth with his own. We stood with our eyes wide and our breath frozen, the space between us ringing like a bell. And then we smiled. The sound of the organ began to fill the sanctuary, signaling the start of the service, and we bolted from the closet. I ran to the women’s restroom and pushed open each of the stall doors to make sure I was alone before standing in front of the mirror to examine my face. I’d expected to see his handprint, like a streak of paint across my jaw, but there was only a faint flush. I craned my neck, looking from every angle, and slapped myself on the opposite side of my face. I waited for the surge I’d felt in the closet when Jeff hit me, the crack of connection, but there was only a dull thud as my hand met my cheek. I hit myself again, and then again until there was a slight sting and I saw the blush even on both sides of my face. Then I ran back down the hall and into the sanctuary, sliding into the pew beside my mother just as the congregation rose for the first hymn. Jeff and I didn’t speak of what happened in the choir closet. Instead, we waited for the children to gather and for the games to begin—hide-and-seek, sardines, tag—before slipping quietly away, into custodial closets or empty Sunday-school classrooms. Alone, we started carefully, cautiously, nudging each other shyly in the shoulder as we stared down at our feet. Then one of us would pinch the other between the ribs or pull on the other’s hair. One of us would slap or scratch or nip the other’s skin with our teeth. And then the moment would come—I’d feel it rising inside me like steam from a kettle—when one of us would push or pinch or tug too hard and we would both startle, staring for a moment in surprise before we lunged and tackled each other to the ground. Over time the games grew rougher. Jeff was larger and stronger and though I could cause him to cry out with a flash of my teeth or a scrape of my fingernails, I was easy to overpower. But this, too, became part of the game—being pinned or pressed or bound by his weight. I would struggle against him as we panted into each other’s faces, his pale-blue eyes and freckly pink skin, his sandy hair damp at the roots, his mouth wet and hot and smelling of the chocolate cookies we stole from the kitchen. “Owie,” Ed Klein said one afternoon, pausing between Cheeto tosses for Mai Tai to point at a bruise on the back of my leg. “It doesn’t hurt,” I told him. This wasn’t true, exactly. It did hurt to be pinched and slapped and bitten. But it was also exciting. Sometimes, afterward, I pressed on the bruises and felt a shiver of delight. Gretta was reading a paperback on a deck chair, and she looked at me from underneath the rim of her sun hat. “That child looks like an overripe banana,” she said. My mother lowered her sunglasses to see. “We bruise so easily,” she murmured, and went back to her magazine. We became bolder, skipping Sunday school or slipping away from choir. We learned the veins and arteries of the building, all the hallways and doorways and stairways in which we could hide or hurry away if we heard someone coming. Even on Sundays, when the church was filled with people, we came to recognize the patterns of their movement, the way the congregation traveled like schools of fish, allowing us to disappear into the empty spaces they left behind. As we wrestled on the floor of Pastor Mike’s office one Sunday, Jeff suddenly stopped and pointed through the darkness at his father’s desk. Folded across the back of the chair was the white muslin robe he wore while preaching, and looped atop that was the rope he used as a belt. My breath quickened. “Where?” I asked. It was midmorning, the stretch of time between the early service and the later one when everyone gathered downstairs for coffee and cookies. The sanctuary was empty, the space silent, and I stood with my back against the base of the iron cross, looping my hands behind it. The rope was stiff and thick and Jeff couldn’t get it tight enough. I could easily have slipped free. But if I held my hands at a certain angle, I could pull against the rope without my wrists coming loose, could feel the strain up my arms and across my shoulders. Jeff put his hand to my face, letting my chin rest in the webbing between his thumb and forefinger, squeezing tighter and tighter as he moved my head up, down, right, left. Then his hand slipped lower to cover my throat. I could smell fruit punch on his breath, could see dark crumbles of cookie in the corners of his mouth. His grip tightened, and I shut my eyes and struggled against the rope as his fingers closed around my neck. “What are you two doing?” At the sound of his brother’s voice, Jeff lurched away from me as though he’d been burned. I slid my hands from the rope, letting it thump to the ground behind me and puddle at the base of the cross. Gabe was with Meg, his hand in the back pocket of her jean shorts as they stared back and forth between us. Meg’s eyes flashed on the rope. “Did he tie you up?” Jeff took a step forward as if to explain, but his mouth only opened and closed soundlessly. Then another, deeper voice spoke from the back of the sanctuary. “How many times do I have to tell you two to quit sneaking off,” Pastor Mike said as he crossed through the pews to Meg and Gabe. He followed their gaze up to the chancel and stopped. “Jeff tied Katie to the cross,” Meg said. My eyes darted from Pastor Mike to Meg. I didn’t know she knew my name. We watched as Pastor Mike bent down to untie his belt from the base of the cross. He stood and put his hand on my shoulder. “The rest of you go back to Fellowship.” “What about her?” Meg asked. “Let me worry about Katie,” Pastor Mike said, and I watched Meg’s eyes travel down the length of his arm to the coil of rope. She hesitated, biting on her bottom lip, before turning to follow the boys out of the sanctuary. Back in his office, Pastor Mike hung his robe in the closet and looped the belt over the hanger, and then sat on the edge of his desk with his hands folded in his lap. They were large and freckled, like his son’s. “Was Jeffrey hurting you?” I shook my head no. His eyes were kind, his voice soft. “You can tell me the truth,” he said. I wanted to tell him the truth. But when I searched inside myself for the words, there were none. “It’s a game,” I said. “What kind of game?” On the wall behind him was a painting of Jesus sitting in a field of flowers with a group of small, sweet-faced children cuddled up against him, kneeling at his feet, leaning on his shoulder, sitting in his lap. “I wanted to be like Jesus.” Pastor Mike stared at me for a long moment without speaking. “If you want to be like Jesus,” he said finally, “you must try to be like him here.” He held one hand to his heart. “You can be like Jesus by being kind and gentle and good. Your body is Christ’s home. Do you understand?” “Like a church,” I said. He smiled. “That’s right. Like a church.” After I left his office, I ran down the stairs and through the halls, the soles of my patent-leather shoes slapping the hard floors. I wanted to do as Pastor Mike said, but something had come loose inside me, pulsing through my arms and legs, pounding between my ears. I was not kind. I was not gentle. I would never, ever be good. In the basement, there were only a half dozen cookies left on the tray. I filled both hands with them and turned to find my grandmother, to be sure she was watching as I stuffed them, one after the other, into my mouth. After that day, Jeff wouldn’t meet my eye or linger with me behind the group. Gabe and Meg were equally hesitant to break off and disappear, and I could only guess that Pastor Mike had had words with his sons. So we rejoined the rest of the children in their games. One rainy afternoon, Kenny led us all to a room he’d discovered upstairs behind the organ loft. The space was small and windowless, and it smelled like dust. We sat on the floor playing Truth or Dare, taking turns making each other lick the bottom of our shoe or confess to the last time we’d wet the bed. I kept looking across the room at Jeff, hoping that someone might dare one of us to do something to the other—wrestle or tackle or kiss on the mouth—though of course no one would. And anyway, he wouldn’t look at me. When it was Meg’s turn, she chose dare, and the boys perked to attention, their eyes traveling back and forth among one another in silent collusion. “Show us your scars,” Kenny said. The room fell silent. We all looked at Meg, who looked back at us, her expression dark and unreadable. “I’d have to take off my pants,” she said, and Kenny rose to his knees, sweat glazing his forehead. “I dare you,” he said. “No way,” Meg said. “Someone might come in.” “It’s a secret room,” Kenny told her. “If it’s so secret,” Meg said, “how come there’s a filing cabinet?” Kenny heaved his stomach sideways to tuck a loose hem of his shirt back into his pants. “If someone comes, we’ll hear them on the stairs.” Meg stood, her eyes narrow, and Gabe jumped up beside her, as though to fend the boys off. But Meg’s gaze shifted past the boys and over to the girls, her expression flattening. “I’ll show them,” she said. She turned back to the boys. “But you have to leave.” “We’re the ones who want to see!” Kenny said, his voice whistling with desperation. Meg’s eyes cut to me. “You want to see, don’t you?” I could feel the others staring. I nodded. “Get out,” Meg snapped at the boys. “You, too,” she told Gabe, who gave her a confused half smile. “I’ve seen your legs lots of times.” “So one less won’t kill you.” She reached out and shoved his shoulders hard with both hands. “Go.” After we heard the boys’ footsteps disappear down the stairs, Meg turned her back to us and lowered her jeans. We all moved forward, huddling close to see. I’d thought the marks would be raised and gnarled, like a tangle of tree roots, but there were only faint lavender lines across the backs of her legs, so light and straight they might have been made with a paintbrush. “Why did he do it, Meg?” Danielle asked. “Yeah, Meg, why did he do it?” Tracy echoed. Meg snorted. “Because he’s an asshole.” Behind us there was a whimper, and I turned to see Marnie standing with her arms twined across her chest and her chin trembling. “He’s really, really sorry,” she whispered. Meg’s head snapped sideways, her eyes locked on her sister’s. As the rest of us crouched at Meg’s feet, they stood staring at each other, caught in a silent exchange I could not translate until Marnie started to cry quietly and Meg pulled her pants back up. “Show’s over,” she said. “Get out.” I saw Meg’s father once at the mall. He and Marnie were drinking milkshakes and sharing a basket of fries in the food court. When I realized who he was, I felt dizzy from fear, as though I’d just stumbled upon a wild animal or a serial killer or a monster from a horror movie. But the longer I watched, the less frightening he became, until he was just a man with smudged glasses and a bald patch and a soft bulge of belly that bubbled over the waist of his pants, a man who could be anyone’s father. The last weekend of the summer was Gretta Benson-Klein’s ice-cream social, an event to which the entire church was invited. “It looks like rain,” my grandmother said when we arrived, and Gretta laughed and told her, “Don’t be ridiculous, Irene. God would never rain on my ice-cream social.” The backyard had been decorated with streamers and, beside the pool, several long tables were spread with platters of cookies and cupcakes, cheese and crackers, pretzels and chips. Gretta’s granddaughters, whom Gretta introduced to me as my future cousins, had come all the way from Denver to help with the event, and the three of us were given pitchers of iced tea and lemonade and sent out among the guests to refill glasses. Lance’s nieces were silver-haired children with high, feathery voices and thin, fluttering limbs. They had to use both hands to carry their pitchers. I made my way around the backyard with my pitcher of iced tea, filling glasses and weaving between tables tiered with drums of ice cream and platters of brownies and cookies and cupcakes, bowls of melted caramel and chocolate sprinkles and hot fudge. “I’m allowed to do this,” Kenny said when I saw him using his hands to swipe frosting off the bottom of a cake pan. “My aunt made this cake.” He laughed and pointed a saliva-slick finger across the yard at Lance’s nieces. “Are those your mom’s real kids?” Even though it was summer and a Saturday, all the children had been made to dress in church clothes, except for Meg and Marnie, who’d come wearing shorts and flip-flops, the straps of their swimsuits visible under their T-shirts. “I guess you get to swim here all the time,” Meg said when I stopped to fill her plastic cup. She was sitting at the edge of the pool with her knees pulled to her chest, and when she didn’t raise her glass for me to pour, I crouched beside her. The surface of the water was choppy from the wind, and she leaned forward, dipping her fingertips. “Must be nice,” she said. “I never learned to swim.” “Didn’t Lance teach you?” I asked, and she turned, her hair blowing across her face. “When would Lance have taught me how to swim?” “When he was dating your mom.” Meg laughed. “Lance Benson doesn’t date my mom, Katie,” she said. “He fucks her.” She hooked her hair at the base of her neck with one hand and leaned back to look at me. “You know the difference, right?” The sky was growing dark with clouds, but people were still eating ice cream and standing in clusters on the lawn, the little kids running around in their clip-on ties and their shiny shoes while the dogs waddled after them, scarfing the crumbs that fell from their paper plates. On the other side of the yard, Lance’s nieces had been relieved of their serving duties and were now performing ballet on the back porch, pliéing and pirouetting beside the barbecue while Gretta and the other church ladies clapped. “I’ve been practicing all summer,” I told Meg, “and I still can’t cross the deep end.” Perhaps I thought my failure could somehow compensate for her lack. She took her cup and turned away from me to drink. When I found Jeff alone by the side of the house, it was easy, among so many people, to disappear. I led him inside, up the stairs and down the hallway to Gretta’s bedroom, and then to her closet, a small, dark room draped on all four sides with her suits and dresses, the floor lined with her shoes. We took our places without discussion: I on my back, he on top of me. I could smell Gretta’s powder and perfume, the yeasty odor of her feet rising from the insoles of her leather pumps. Jeff pinned my hands to the floor with his, digging his thumbs into my wrists, rocking the full weight of himself on top of me. “Fight,” he said. I writhed and thrashed, arching my back and kicking my feet as he wrestled and squeezed and slammed me back down against the floor. His knee landed between my legs and a bolt of heat shot through my lower back to my top of my head. I could feel the energy pulsing from the palms of his hands into my wrists, a current that coursed through me and lit me up like a Christmas tree. I cried out and pressed my hips harder into his. “What the hell are you doing?” At the sound of Gretta’s voice, we lurched apart, scrambling to our feet. One side of my dress had caught in my underwear and I yanked it down, mortified. But Gretta wasn’t looking at me. She grabbed Jeffrey by the collar of his shirt, yanking him so hard that he yelped. “You filth,” she said to him. “You garbage.” But even as she sneered and shook him by the collar of his shirt, I could see the smile spreading behind her eyes, the knowledge that the final move had been made in some long and complicated game. For a while, though, it seemed as if the entire matter would go no further—as if it might even have been forgotten. Outside, it had begun to rain—Gretta had come in for a sweater—and by the time we returned to the backyard, the wind was howling, the rain falling in sideways sheets. Around the pool, people rushed to bring in food and lower patio umbrellas, bracing against the wind and whooping as the rain fell harder and harder. Then someone screamed that there was a mudslide, and everyone poured inside the house. I don’t know how I was able to hear my mother, through the wind and thunder and people shouting all around me, but the sound of her voice screaming my name in the backyard ignited me through the crowd as I shoved between the crush of people to the doors. Outside, tables were overturned, tablecloths flapping. Paper plates and plastic cups swirled across the lawn, a sandstorm of party food blowing into the pool. I now seem to remember Ed Klein bracing against the wind, his bad arm raised to shield his eyes, his good arm cranking closed the cover over the pool. I know, of course, that my mother and I must have had physical contact when I was a child, that she would have brushed my hair and tied my shoes and bathed me. In that first year after the divorce, I often slept in her bed. And yet the storm at Gretta Benson-Klein’s ice-cream social is the only memory I have from my childhood of my mother and me touching. The shock of that moment lives inside my body, the strength of her hands as she caught me from behind and the force with which she pulled me against herself, holding me as we looked up at the red mud pouring down the cliffs in rapids, the roar and crack of the great boulders falling and breaking, the lightness with which my feet left the ground when my mother lifted and carried me to the house, as though I was still a very young child, as though I was weightless. When Gretta finally called, it was to tell my grandmother what she’d already told the presbytery and half the congregation as well. She was sorry to leave my grandmother out of the loop for so long, she said. Her delay in communication was the result of a difficult loss: after the storm, they’d uncovered the pool to discover their little Mai Tai floating dead in the water. I was not permitted to watch the episode of Gretta’s show in which she discussed on camera the incident in her closet, but it would serve, for a time, as a call to arms for those in the valley who objected to sexual content in popular music and would inspire a series of highly publicized but ultimately ineffectual petitions to ban MTV from the town of Fortune. Nearly two months passed before Pastor Mike was officially dismissed, but the Wilson family never appeared in church during that time. Instead, services were led by the associate pastor, a young man with a low voice and small constellations of acne along his jaw. At home, my grandmother wept at the dinner table. I was ruined, she said. Ruined! At which point my grandfather slammed his fist on the table so hard the plates leaped and the salt and pepper shakers spilled and all of us gasped and stared at him. “Enough,” he said. “We will never speak of this again.” And we never did. A few years back, at my request, my mother drove us out to the edge of the valley in search of Gretta’s house. So much time had passed since either of us had been there, and we struggled, amid all the new development, to identify old landmarks, and to remember the name of the street—Redstone? Sunstone? Red Sand? This was the summer before my stepfather received his diagnosis and started chemotherapy; six months before my mother would confess to me, in secret, that she’d been asked by her doctor to draw the face of a clock and had been unable to do so; my last visit home during which, when she and I went out together, she was the one who drove. We never found the house. I’d been sure I would recognize the street, the circular drive, the front yard, but perhaps my own memory is not, after all these years, as stainless as I believe. Strangest of all are not the things I’ve forgotten, but those I recall that never happened—or anyway, never happened to me. I remember so clearly the morning after the storm, when Ed Klein went outside to uncover the pool and found Mai Tai drowned amid the debris from the party—soggy crackers and bloated cheese cubes, paper napkins suspended translucent in the water. I know I wasn’t there, because my mother has told me over and over again that I wasn’t. But still I remember it—not the way it looked or the way it sounded, but the way it felt inside my body. And this, I suppose, is the greatest evidence that my memory is false: When I find myself back in that place, in that time, I’m not on the patio or in the yard. I’m not a witness. I remember it as if it happened to me. I can feel myself disappearing below the surface, can see the light fragmented above me and the little white legs of the dog frantic and churning. I remember us all in there together, me and Mai Tai, Jeffrey and Gabe, Meg and Marnie, all of us kicking and thrashing and choking for air, tangled together in the stories we’d been told about ourselves, grasping for a god who had already abandoned us, sinking beneath the weight of all the secrets we didn’t yet know we were keeping.

        "story": "The school gave us the eggs at the end of autumn, just as the weather began to turn, the mornings so cold we expected gooseflesh to rise on the smooth surface of the shells. The eggs weren’t very big, the size of a child’s closed fist. They were shiny and white like a rolling eyeball. We were sixteen and trusted to develop a maternal instinct overnight, to become mothers one day and contribute to the dwindling population. We didn’t know where the eggs had come from, only that they were alive and we should take care of them. One egg for each student. We often spoke about leaving. We dreamed of cities and towns far from the peninsula. Kanazawa, we whispered. Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka. The forbidden words sent thrills through us like waves. Who would we marry? How would we have children when our options were confined to this small town on this thin strip of land that stuck out into the sea? Although we asked questions about a life beyond, our parents were the ashamed ones, ashamed of the elderly road workers who hid their age by standing straight and covering their bald heads with wool caps. We liked being young among the old. There was a comfort in walking through the market on Sunday mornings and seeing the same faces week after week, the women who sat on low stools behind their stands selling dried squid, tangles of seaweed, salted fish, persimmons, and mandarins. They didn’t change the way we did, our bodies straining against our skin in fluctuations painfully obvious from one day to the next. On weekends, back from school, I helped my mother at the gift shop. The work wasn’t demanding. In the mornings I made onigiri with three different fillings: umeboshi, bonito flakes, and tuna mayonnaise, the last one my favorite. I liked how the mayonnaise squeezed through the grains of rice with each bite. To shape the onigiri, you had to use rice that was scalding; I was proud of the way my hands withstood heat. We ate whatever went unsold for dinner with boiled spinach. During the high season we saw two to three visitors a day. A retired couple who had read about the pebble beach in a guidebook, and sometimes, rarely, a foreigner who delighted in the desolate landscape. There is no one here, it’s so unlike anywhere else I’ve been to! My mother would smile and nod. The end of the world, she would say, one of the few phrases she knew in English, hoping they might buy a snack on the way out. That year we had the option to board Monday through Friday, and since the school was an hour’s drive away, my mother had requested that I stay there during the week. It wasn’t good for a girl my age to spend her evenings alone or with her mother, she said, but I didn’t mind the solitude, and I knew she was glad, too. Of course I took some pleasure in pretending at freedom. After class, my friends and I walked through the town like tourists, our leather shoes loud on the pavement. There was a movie theater and a drugstore with more beauty products than we’d ever seen. We shared face creams and exfoliants, painted our eyebrows and curled our lashes. We became regulars at the bakery that made cream puffs on the hour, the scent of caramelized sugar and butter wafting through the streets. Still, I felt an ache when I tried to fall asleep in a room full of my classmates, our narrow cots lined up in rows. The day we were given the eggs, Yuko got up from her chair as soon as the teacher left and addressed us. What are we, she said, dangerously cupping her egg in one hand, mother hens? Yuko was unafraid to show her disgust. Of all the girls at school, I liked her the best. I often looked at the way her thighs brushed against one another when she walked, the fabric of her tights swooshing under her skirt. She’d sworn never to have children. Pregnancy is vulgar, she said, the transformation a monstrosity. She showed us the stretch marks on the wide planes of her behind. Because her skin was prone to scarring, she knew her stomach wouldn’t be spared. The marks trembled under her touch, like the cracks we imagined might one day appear on our eggs. At night, we kept the eggs on our side tables, each one wrapped in a pillowcase so it wouldn’t roll around. Between classes we gathered in the courtyard and held them against our chests, sometimes under our blazers, afraid they would freeze from the cold. We exhaled white mist into the air, our bodies shrinking as our insides compressed to retain heat. We studied one another’s eggs openly, searching for cracks. We were told it would be noiseless and quick, the first crack as fine as a strand of hair, a line of pencil, felt only with the pads of our fingers. By the end of the first week, we knew our eggs’ surfaces so intimately that were they to be swapped in our sleep, we would notice. My mother called me on my birthday, an hour before bedtime. I almost wished she had forgotten. Happy birthday, she said, her tone even. How was your day? I told her it was a day like any other, though they had served chocolate cake for dessert. That’s more than my parents ever gave me. They never celebrated my birthday. I bristled at her complaint and said that she told me this every year. You always bring things back to yourself. I said it was time for bed and that I would hang up the phone. Her voice softened slightly: We are always more sensitive on this day, aren’t we? November was cold and we ate with abandon, or at least I did. I waited for my mother to call or send me a letter. The other girls often received envelopes with money or packages of fruits and sweets. There was nothing for me but the plates of food from the cafeteria. Most of the girls were on a diet, so I took their rice, drowning the grains in broth and gulping it down. It was bad manners, but my mother wasn’t there to see. On weekends, I noticed that her gait was lighter, as though I were a weight that had been lifted. She left clothes in the living room and dishes on the drying rack. Even her voice had changed. Sometimes I caught her humming a tune from a black-and-white movie she liked. I looked at her with suspicion, not knowing how to share these feelings of distrust with my classmates, who all seemed to ignore their own mothers. At home, I placed the egg on a shelf in my bedroom. If my mother saw it, she would question me, would want to touch it. She often dropped fragile items without warning. She’d be standing in the middle of the kitchen, drying a plate, and all of a sudden it would crash to her feet. But she didn’t come to my room. We ate breakfast separately because she awoke long before me. That month we had a few visitors from the mainland and from abroad. Two middle-aged women from Beijing, a backpacker from New Zealand, a father and son from Germany. Otherwise it was quiet. I spent hours on the pebble beach, staring out at the sea. To access the beach, one had to walk through the visitors’ center and gift shop, past the glass doors, and down a stone stairway. A rope handrail ran along one side of the steps. Far below, the cove opened onto dark-blue waves that frothed up against the land. On both sides, tall rock formations shielded most of the beach from the sun, creating a dramatic contrast between the pale sky and the black rocks. The peninsula was surrounded by uninhabited islands. We had three in our cove. They were perfectly round and covered with dense forest; from afar they looked like floating green puffs. The summers were always scorching, but the sea brought in a cool breeze and the rocks protected me from the sun. On the hottest days, I would stand in their shade and press my cheek against their hard, wet surface. We had no visitors that first Saturday of December. The wind picked up in the afternoon and the sky darkened. I sat on a stool and listened to the wind wail against the glass doors, louder than the tinkling music that we played through speakers in the ceiling. My mother was unperturbed by the storm. She restocked the shelves, moving items around and testing new positions, hoping they might draw a customer’s eye. She wiped dust with a damp cloth. Her expression was calm, just as when she daydreamed. At the end of the day, we slowly walked home, crouched against the wind, our arms pressing our coats shut. Unlike other mothers, mine wasn’t skilled in the kitchen. She could make rice, soup, and simple vegetables, but she cooked fish and meat to death, flesh dry and blackened, skin stuck to the pan. I had become the cook. I would make bacon and eggs for dinner, tuna sandwiches for lunch. That night I fried rice with old vegetables: half a cabbage and a few carrots, their tips soft. I loved the crust that formed on the bottom of the pan, the rice translucent and crisp with oil. I would wait a few minutes for it to loosen and then scrape it off with a metal spoon. We ate the rice with salted fish and the last of our pickled greens. I once had an egg like yours, my mother said. She was chasing grains of rice on her plate, difficult to catch when they weren’t clumped together. So she had seen it. The school gave them to us in our final year, she added. You were older. She caught a grain with her chopsticks. I wonder why you’re receiving yours now. What are they for? My mother gathered our plates and began washing them in the sink. I asked her again. Why did you have an egg? After a moment of silence, she said that she couldn’t remember. What did you do with it? She turned to me and laughed: An egg is for eating, isn’t it. The following morning, I was sitting on the pebble beach when I saw a man walk down the stairway. He held on to the rope and took the steps one at a time. I was used to their unevenness and ran down them, often jumping over the last three. It was the coldest it had been that month and I had chosen a rock that had warmed in the sun. There was no wind, and piles of seaweed lined the shore. The water was dark and swollen from the storm. I’d brought the egg with me and nestled it among the pebbles. Its dome sparkled in the sun. The man walked in my direction. He wore a gray suit, leather shoes, and sunglasses. From the city, I guessed. He seemed to be younger than my mother, but it was hard to tell with the glasses hiding his eyes. As he came closer, I wished I’d had time to hide the egg under my coat. He sat on a rock close to mine and stared out at the water. I’ve wanted to come here for a long time, he said. He continued to look away from me. This is the only place I’ve ever known. The man smiled. Why did you come here? I asked. A woman I once loved told me about this beach. Is she from here? He nodded. She would close her eyes and describe it as if it were her childhood house. Her memories became my own. I knew about the gift shop and those steps and the rope. I even knew how the rope would feel, heavy from the salt. He rubbed his fingers where they had touched the rope. My mother owns the gift shop, I said, glancing at the small building above the cove. We sat in silence for a few minutes. Is it how you pictured it? The man considered my question. A moment later, he removed his glasses and squinted at the sea. Everything is how I imagined it, even the smell, but she never told me about those islands. They look like forests, don’t they? He turned to me. His eyes were pale brown in the sun, an unusual color. I blushed. His gaze lingered and then shifted to my feet, where the egg rested. He flinched and turned white. Are you all right? I asked, wanting the egg to disappear. I cursed myself for having brought it to the beach. What a beautiful stone, he said. Can I touch it? I was reminded of my mother once asking a pregnant woman if she could touch her, all seven months of her rounded stomach. The woman had pushed aside her scarf and unbuttoned her coat so that my mother could place her hand, palm down, directly onto her dress. I overheard my mother tell a woman at the market that I cried all the time as a baby. We had paused in front of a stand that sold baked goods. The loaves were small and dense, studded with dried fruit, nuts, and cheese. She exhausted me, my mother said. The woman listened and selected a long loaf the shape of a stick. I had never seen her before, perhaps she had moved recently. Isn’t it normal for babies to cry? the woman asked, uncertain. She paid for the bread and put it in her bag. A dark-brown walnut ruptured its crust. I waited for my mother to respond. Her shoulders tensed under her wool jacket. It was almost one in the afternoon and the light was strong. This was something else, she said. It would have driven anyone mad. The woman nodded goodbye and walked away. What do you want? my mother asked me, pointing at the loaves. I gestured to the milk bread, its top shiny and burnished. The inside would be soft from the eggs, ready to be pulled apart with our hands. We ate it warm from the oven, with a thick layer of strawberry jam. As we put away the food, I asked her what it had been, the something else that made me cry. I think you cried because you were hungry. I knew my supply was low. My mother had to feed me goat’s milk. She always said the women in our family couldn’t nurse, and I felt I was defying her by breastfeeding you as long as I could. How long? It must have been two and a half years. I tried to imagine her holding a child. It was difficult to conjure. Instead I saw a sack of potatoes in her arms, their rounded shapes rolling against her chest. As a two-year-old, I would have walked up to her and opened her shirt with my hands and she would have been free to continue doing whatever she was doing with her own hands. I would have served myself. I had no memories of this, just a sense of security, similar to when we shared the same bathwater after dinner. The familiarity of her silhouette in the tub, her shoulders rising above the water. An impression that I knew her better unclothed. We stayed at the table for a while drinking cold tea, the afternoon a blank canvas. We used to play a game when you were little, my mother said. What was it? You would stretch out on the floor, close your eyes, and pretend to be dead. I would walk into the room, not see you for a moment, and then scream. Each time was different, but the ending was the same: I would lie down next to you and pretend to die, too. On Monday, we sneaked glances at each other to see whether anyone had forgotten their egg. A rumor floated that someone’s egg had broken and spilled onto the floor. What was inside? we asked, our skin prickling from the cold. The pungent smell of a decomposing body, three bright orange yolks, the translucent skeleton of a small child, like the shell of a shrimp. Yuko held her egg beneath her chin. She stroked its private surface. Her face shone red. Later, I would pinch my cheeks for the same color. There is nothing inside, she told us. I don’t believe you, said Mari. She made as if to shake her egg, to see whether she could hear the sound of a thing inside it. We held our breaths. There was a moment of terror as we watched her. She paused midair and gently lowered the egg. They are worried that one day everyone will be gone, Yuko said. Old age was like catching a cold, the teachers liked to tell us, afraid that if we stayed, our youthful essence would be sanded away. We’ll be gone, Mari said. I’ll stay here. The sound of my voice surprised me. Why had I spoken? Yuko smiled, as though she understood. When I thought about it some more during class, I couldn’t picture myself at my mother’s age, seated behind the counter of the gift shop, just as I couldn’t imagine her growing old or us becoming close. But where would I go? Would I follow my classmates to the mainland and evaporate into a city? What would happen to my mother? A part of me thought she might stay in the gift shop forever, though maybe she would leave too, no longer bound to the peninsula by me. That night, Yuko and I brushed our teeth side by side before bed. We had started at the same time, and I wondered who would finish first. She was vigorous, reaching far into the back of her mouth, whereas I was gentle on my gums. I finally yielded and turned on the faucet to rinse. Yuko leaned against the sink after wiping her lips dry. She told me that the previous summer her parents had taken her on a bus off the peninsula. It was just for a day, they had a meeting with an accountant, and she had begged to accompany them. She described a city with tall buildings that required elevators, wide roads with streetlights, people of all ages hurrying from one place to the next. What surprised her was the silence—even the restaurant where they had lunch was quiet. She had expected the city to be loud and bustling, strings of people walking together, animated in conversation. You don’t have the ocean, she said. She felt enclosed in a large empty space, something vast and clean. What you felt wasn’t freedom, I offered, hoping I had grasped the meaning of her words. She swept her arms around the bathroom we shared with twenty girls. Don’t tell the others, but I was happy to return that night. Before going to sleep, I watched my egg up close. The color seemed to have changed from a milky white to a more transparent, pulsing yellow that rippled from the crown to the middle, like the skin on the inside of my wrists. I thought about the man on the pebble beach, how he knelt and wrapped his hands around my egg, color returning to his face. Yuko didn’t come to class the following week. We assumed it had to do with her egg. We tried to avoid staring at her empty seat. Mari dropped her head onto her desk and closed her eyes. On weekends she woke up before sunrise to help her grandmother at the market, and afterward she dried strands of seaweed on their clotheslines. The salt had damaged her hands. They were like my mother’s, cracked at the fingers and red. We waited for Yuko to return. Her desk remained vacant, her chair tucked into its place. My mother was sick that weekend and stayed in bed both days. I worked at the gift shop alone, dusting the shelves, lining the onigiri in the refrigerator by the entrance, checking the toilet paper in the restrooms. One family came by on Sunday morning. They walked past me without looking but bowed their heads to acknowledge my presence. It was getting too cold for tourists. The sun set at four in the afternoon. I locked the door and walked home. I had grown used to the egg and almost forgot it was there. It was heavier than I remembered. My mother lay in bed, her back turned away from me. I knew she was faking sleep. I sat in the kitchen and held the egg on the table. I heard my mother cough, a wet sound. I pictured her lungs soaked in a viscous liquid that rose to her throat and filled her mouth. The egg fit under my outstretched fingers and I rolled it back and forth, applying more pressure. It grew hotter the more I pushed it against the surface. I brushed a leftover onigiri with soy sauce and grilled it on the stove with sesame oil. I placed it on a plate with a pickled plum and brought it to my mother with a cup of hot buckwheat tea. She was seated in bed, a pillow behind her lower back. Did you see that man in the gift shop? I asked. She narrowed her eyes. You know I’ve been in bed all day. Last weekend. He was wearing a suit and sunglasses. No one came by last weekend. I set the tray on her lap. She picked up the plum and popped it in her mouth. Her lips puckered at the sourness. Did your friends leave after high school? I asked her. Did they go to the mainland? Some of them, yes. And you never thought of it? She sipped her tea. Of course I thought of leaving, all the time, but I knew that leaving would change me and that when I returned I would no longer find my place, like a square inside a circle. Two more girls were absent and Yuko’s desk had been removed. We didn’t dare ask the teachers about it. Between classes, Mari pulled me aside and whispered into my ear: Yuko’s mother always comes to the market, but this weekend she wasn’t there. As I listened to her, I felt a new warmth radiate from the bottom of my bag, where the egg was cradled. Where could they have gone? I asked. Tokyo, Mari said. Yuko was always bragging about her uncle in Tokyo. Saitama, I corrected her, which was thirty kilometers north of the city. Mari brushed me off. Regardless, she never liked living so close to the sea. You know she was afraid of drowning. I moved away from Mari. If they’re gone, then there’s no point in dwelling on them. In the cafeteria that evening, we rearranged our seating to account for the missing students. We sat next to girls who had once been at the other end of the table, whose eating habits we had never observed. It was strange to have an unfamiliar presence beside us, new sounds and movements. A sudden shyness overcame me, and I remembered to chew each mouthful and sip slowly. Mari sat to my left and finished her sweet potato soup before anyone else. She had chosen an apple for dessert. She kept a Swiss Army knife in her pocket and used it to peel the apple, her thumb pressed against the blade. She cut just under the skin, a thin layer of white flesh clinging to the peel. She didn’t pause until she was finished and then held up the long peel like a prize. One curled strip, unraveling from where she pinched it with her fingers. We watched the coil bounce in the air. You can learn so much from a person by observing the way they peel fruit, Mari said. She cut the apple into quarters and sliced off the seeds. Like what? I asked. Whether someone taught them to do it. I indulged her and asked how she could see whether someone had been taught. The way you place the knife, she said. Toward you or away from you. I always cut toward me. It’s more dangerous but gives you better control. My mother taught me. I envied her for having a mother who knew how to peel fruit and sat patiently with her daughter, pressing her thumb against hers. But I also felt I should defend my mother, who would never have allowed herself such a frivolous activity. The following day, we received notice that the school would shut down in the new year. There were so few of us to begin with, and several families and teachers had chosen to leave for the mainland. We were distracted by the news and started to forget our eggs in classrooms, took someone else’s by accident, misplaced them for hours. Mari even dropped hers. We watched in horror as it rolled under a desk. It came to a stop against the wall, unscathed. My mother only spoke about my father once. He arrived in the rainy season and stayed until the first change of leaves in October. One morning, not long before he left, they went down to the pebble beach. It was cold and cloudy, but he removed his clothes and waded into the water. No one swam in the cove; it was dangerous, with whirlpools that sucked you under. A child was once found at the shore, cut up from being thrown against the sharp rocks. My father swam out until he was a speck on the horizon. My mother was already pregnant with me, though she didn’t know it yet. She waited at the edge of the water, holding her cardigan tightly, telling herself that she shouldn’t be afraid. If she kept her eyes on him, then he wouldn’t drown. Soon she couldn’t see him, but she continued to stare at the sea. After a while he appeared again, a black dot, then his arms beating into the waves. Where did you go? she asked, as she dried him with her cardigan. I wanted to see if I could swim to one of the islands. Did you? He shook his head. Not even halfway. Once he had started swimming, he saw they were much farther than they appeared. Listening to him, she realized that she had never thought about swimming to the islands, or anywhere really. Until then, the possibility of leaving the island had not occurred to her. There were no photos of my father. All I had was my reflection in the mirror and the ways I was different from my mother: my darker skin, the sharp tip of my chin, the black flecks in my eyes. When I dreamt of him, I saw a man like the one I had met at the beach, dressed in city clothes, with eyes like mine behind his sunglasses. I had to go home on Wednesday because my mother was still sick and called the school. I’d never known her to miss a day of work, even when she had a fever. I slid open the door and called out. No one answered. The wind rattled the slender frame of our house. The wood paneling had begun to rot from the humidity. My mother was in bed and I smelled the sweat on her sheets. She opened her eyes and smiled faintly. What do you have? I asked. I don’t know, she said, her voice a quiet rasp. Have you eaten? She shook her head. I began to peel the sheets away from her. I have to replace them, I explained. They were soaked in sweat. I bathed her with a hand towel and changed her into a clean nightgown. Her body looked thinner than I remembered, rib cage bowing against her skin, nipples dark and shriveled from the cold. Let’s call the doctor, I said. No, don’t bother. She looked away. I sat in her bedroom until I could see the pale-yellow outline of the moon. There was almost no food in the kitchen. The two onigiri that I’d left in the fridge had vanished. She hadn’t gone to the market and we didn’t keep many dried goods aside from a bag of rice and a few strips of kombu. I opened my schoolbag and took out the egg. I placed it on the table and gave it a gentle tap. It made a dull sound. I tapped harder. My heart banged against my chest and my ears filled with its loud beat. The egg cracked and spilled onto the table. Split open it was merely a yolk held by a thin membrane. Surprise passed through me as the white spread along the flat surface. I placed a bowl beneath one end of the table and scraped every last bit with my hands. I knew to heat the pan until the oil shimmered but before it smoked. The first layer hit with a hiss. I used long chopsticks to flip and fold the egg and added more oil when the pan began to dry. The omelet was a thin log, barely enough for one person. I carried the plate to my mother. Two spots of color had formed on her cheeks. I could smell it, she said, even with the door closed. She lifted herself and folded the sheet over her lap, as though setting the table. She leaned over the plate and inhaled. I watched her eat, one bite at a time. Her throat rose and fell as she swallowed. When she had finished, she placed the plate on the floor. What did it taste like? I asked. She disappeared into the bed and drew the sheet up to her face. Sweet, the way rice does after you’ve chewed it for a while. She licked her lips. Salty, like sweat. The school is closing, I said. Yes, I heard. She covered her mouth to cough. Where would you like to go? I lay down beside her.

        "story": "I live with my grandmother in a town called Laskerville. The town was created a hundred years ago when they dammed the Sassusquanatt River. It’s a pretty town—just what you would think. What does it look like? Out the front door of my grandmother’s house you can see clear up the riverbed ten miles to the edifice of the dam, rising pale and inarguable like a cliff. And below it all these ridiculous lives in a deep ravine. There are houses all around ours. In that respect we’re far from alone. There’s a church. There used to be a grocery, an army-navy store, a five-and-ten. All in the shadow of the dam. Now the only thing left is the post office, and that’s closing next week. Nearly all the houses are empty. You can bang on doors if you like, but no one will come. I know because I tried it. I came here six months ago and I have only one friend, Loma, whose father is unbelievably strong. I once saw him move a stove by himself. Loma said to me, Ignatius—she always uses my full name—just hold the door. He can get it. And her father picked up the stove and carried it out of the house and down the steps like it was nothing. Loma is eighteen. She and her family are sticking around so her dad can scavenge the town. He takes boilers, stoves, copper wire from the walls. He knows a little about anything and everything. Call me Hank, he told me one time. I don’t know what his original name is. When I came the town had already gotten the news. Most of the people had left. I only ended up here because I had no choice. Thing is—my dad got sent to prison. For a long stretch everything was fine with my dad and me, but then he got caught buying stolen cars and stripping them. There were seven or eight cars in the garage when the police got there, and not one of them was his. So he went away, and I got a bus ticket to his mother, Grandma Palavar. I never heard her first name. Not sure she has one. But she has a dark turn of mind, Grandma. The other day a man came from the school system to find out why I wasn’t in school. Her face is always kind of twisted up, even at the best of times, and as she stuck it out the door she twisted it up real skeptical. What’s that? You want the boy in school? Can’t you see there’s no school anymore? They took all the tables. No one’s been in there for weeks. But, Mrs. Palavar, if you would move to the housing we’ve set up, there is indeed a temporary school building. If my husband were here, I know what he’d say. He’d, he’d say: Climb up there into your own ass real deep and take a nap, if you can stomach the stench, and leave the rest of us alone. The man smiled weakly and excused himself. He left some official-looking paper, which my grandma put into the stove. There’s no one to like anymore. One day it happened, everyone stopped being worth liking. Not you, of course, Iggy. Not you. Not Loma. That’s right. Not Loma. The place I used to live before is called Pittsburgh. You must have heard of it. Pittsburgh’s a real town. A lot of important people come from Pittsburgh. Anywhere in the world you go, you could say, I’m from Pittsburgh, you know, if they ask you where you’re from, and when you say Pittsburgh they’ll perk right up. They know it’s not nothing. So you can imagine how thrilled I was to fill up my dad’s old seabag with everything I own and get on a goddamn bus to Laskerville. Even if my life in Pittsburgh was mostly helping my dad take cars apart, watching for the police, and showing up late to school, I didn’t mind it. I’m not one of those people who hate school, by the way. All my teachers loved me, and so they would get angry when I wouldn’t come for a week or two, but I’d still pass all the tests. Sometimes other people would even cheat off my exams, which I don’t mind at all. Cheating is a very important skill for some people to learn. If you are the sort of person who needs to cheat, then you should become good at it as soon as possible, trust me. Here in Laskerville the school officials can hassle us because I’m fourteen and can’t drop out yet. For a long time my plan was to join the French Foreign Legion, but I don’t want to shoot anyone, and I guess that’s part of the racket. Even Grandma says that probably I should stick it out in school since I’m so good at it. Loma thinks that, too. She told me I know as much as someone her age, maybe more, and Loma never exaggerates. She measures things exactly as they are every time, and that’s what she says. It is such a comfort to me I can’t tell you. You see, Grandma Palavar, who is most definitely a straight shooter, has had a difficult time of it. She lost her leg and has this horrid prosthetic that I usually have to help her with because some of the straps are broken and she won’t bother to get it fixed. And then once she got used to the false leg, her husband up and died. But she keeps going. She insists, though, that he didn’t die, and continues talking to him. I’m not to lock the front door, because he comes in that way in the night and sits at the table, and the three of us have conversations, which is a difficult business because I can’t hear anything he says. But Grandma lets me in on what he’s saying. A lot of it is complaints, and a lot of it is advice, which is essentially what you’d expect an old person or a dead person or a dead old person to say. Some of it sounds like her advice. And as for the complaints, well, most people’s complaints are the same. But some of the stuff he says I’ve never heard before. I don’t know where Grandma dreams it up. One time we’re sitting there and Grandma says, Be still, Iggy, he’s at the door. And she went over and opened it, and he came in. Then she sits down, and the two of us are there at the table, and she says, Move the chair a little, it’s not quite where he wants it. So I say, Where does he want it, and she says, A little that way. I move it a little that way. A little more. Okay, how about there? Okay, he’s sitting down. And she makes a pot of tea, and cracks open a cold beer and sticks it on the table with a bowl of pickles. She keeps the beer for his visits. No one else can get near it. Then she says, Iggy, Grandpa wants to tell you about something. So I say, Thank you, Grandma, I’m ready to hear it, and she says, Iggy you’re a young man, and I say, Is that you saying that, and she says, No, I’ve started, keep quiet. You’re a young man, and you’re going to be in a lot of places, rough places I can tell. It’s in your brow. I can see it there, all the trouble you’re aimed at. So I want you to know something I told your father years ago, something that served him well. I’m going to tell it to you. Thank you, Grandpa, I said. I didn’t like to say it, to talk outright to him, being that he wasn’t there, but sometimes it was necessary or Grandma would have a conniption. When you’re in one of these places, son, and you’re around a lot of types, you know, weak types, rough types, loud types, you’ll see sometimes you run afoul of somebody. They take a dislike to you. All right, Grandpa, I get it. Well, when one of these types gets near you, if you get to feeling the skin on the back of your neck—that’s an old trick. That’s the trick. We’ve always been able to do it. I looked at my grandma, but she was looking at the spot right above the beer, at the empty chair and such. The trick? When you feel that patch of skin, that’s the moment. You just up and slug the guy. Hit him in the mouth hard as you can. It’s our benefit, us Palavars. We can tell when it’s about to happen right before it happens, and so we can get an extra one in. It’s Tuesday or Wednesday, I’m not sure which, and I’m sitting with Loma at the bus station. Of course there aren’t any buses there anymore, but it’s a good place to smoke cigarettes. I don’t smoke, but Loma does, and she sits on the bus station wall looking down at me. She’s got a red jacket on, and I am completely in love with her. Loma tells me, Ignatius, men used to wear hats all the time. They never went anywhere without hats. But they weren’t ever to wear them indoors, it was a kind of rule. Outdoors, always a hat; indoors, never a hat. And the worst thing you could do was knock someone’s hat off. If you did that, they were allowed to kill you. How would they kill you? Well at first probably with swords, but then with pistols. And since it started being pistols it’s always been pistols. The point of a pistol is to shoot someone who is unarmed. If you’re fighting somebody who has a gun then you want a real gun, like a rifle or a shotgun, not a pistol. Pistols were first created for officers to shoot their own men, in order to force them to charge in battle. The soldiers were always running away. Of course they were. Who would want to fight in a battle? She tells me, during the Civil War, the North and the South had different specifications for their train tracks. So whenever the battle lines moved they brought along some poor bastards whose job was to move the train tracks a few inches this way or that. I tell Loma that it’s almost time to watch Bell the Cat and she gets excited. We practically run to my Grandma’s house and set up by the TV in the attic—that’s where I sleep. The TV doesn’t work, but it’s the only one we have. Loma’s folks don’t have a TV at all. This one is a proper color television but there’s no picture. It worked for about a week or so, and when Loma and I started hanging out we watched Bell the Cat in color once or twice, and then when the third episode comes along, there’s no picture, just sound. But we don’t give up. Loma and I listen to the broadcast and we talk about the events, we talk about what we probably would get to see if we could see it. Loma’s good at paying attention, and I am too, and we’re real quiet, listening to every last damned thing we can hear, and afterward we dissect it. We come up with our theories. Bell the Cat is a Japanese show. It’s broadcast in England though, so it gets shown on the BBC, which is how it ends up on PBS here in Pennsylvania. And luckily PBS is about the only station we get. I know what you’re thinking—it must be a really good show if it’s made in Japan but the British had to have it too, and then when the Americans heard about it, they had to have it just the same. And yes—it is. It’s the best show of all time. For Bell the Cat, the Japanese built a house that is made for giants. I think it’s somewhere outside of Tokyo. It’s a real house, a regular house like you would live in, but at giant size. Everything is in proportion: the chairs, the tables, the windows, the doorknobs, the oven, you name it. Then they built a robot family, a man, a woman, two kids. The family moves around the house on these tracks, kind of predictably, and does things that a typical Japanese family would do. The family’s like clockwork. They’re the background of the thing—they give you the feeling that it’s a house that’s lived in. But then there’s the cat. It’s a giant cat, of course, because it has to be the right size for the family. And it’s a robot cat, or maybe, well, I should say: I think it’s a robot cat, but Loma thinks it is a cat with a pilot inside. She thinks someone’s piloting the cat. We can’t quite figure it out. Anyway, the theme of the show is: a bunch of Japanese men and women, and maybe a few kids (this is also a point of argument), are dressed up in mouse costumes. They run around back and forth in the house. They’ve been locked in there for a year, that’s the premise, and they have to feed themselves. Now I know that robots don’t eat, and you know that too, but there has to be food for the mice to forage, so the producers make the robots act like they’re eating food, make them leave some of it on plates, drop crumbs, etc. The pantry is stocked with food, Japanese food, which is, of course, in this case, giant-size food. In the episode we saw the food was very beautiful. Two of the mice got into a package of rice crackers and it was a dream, just a dream. My grandma likes to tell me how it is. She’ll say, for instance, Iggy, it’s 1989, your mom is never coming back. And even if she did, I’d send her away, just send her away, and you know what you’d do? You’d keep your damned mouth shut and we’d watch her walk her ass right out of here. Grandma Palavar has always hated my mom, especially after my mom got a job as a stewardess, left for a month, and then left for good. She was a very beautiful woman, my mother, at least that’s what my father’s girlfriends would say to me. They would take some pictures out of a shoebox and we’d look at them, and they’d say to me, Iggy, your mother was a very beautiful woman. Just look at her. She must have turned a lot of heads. And I would say, I don’t think I look like her at all, which I don’t, and then the girlfriends, practically en masse, would argue that I did, that I looked just like her, why, here, a little bit in the nose, in the eyes, etc. My father was not bad to look at either, I guess, which is why our house has always been full of women. But I don’t really look like him either. He has this thing he does where he gets excited and he looks at you like a tractor beam. You know—you’re just stuck staring into his eyes and he’s explaining about a church in Tennessee that got bulldozed years ago, but then was found somehow intact inside the chamber of a coal mine. Crazy stuff like that. My grandma told me that if I wasn’t going to school, I should have a project. So I started making a census of all the cats in the town. I do this by meticulously observing each cat and noting its movements. Then I made a large map of the town, and specified each cat’s range. My grandpa told my grandma to tell me I was doing it wrong, but he didn’t say how. Loma’s theory about the cat pilot is the following: No robot is smart enough to make decisions and follow the mice from room to room. Also, no robot can see well enough to identify the mice when they’re hiding against misleading backgrounds, like a floral-print couch. I feel very sure that the cat is a robot. I feel sure there is no pilot. But I don’t have any good argument to tell to Loma, so I stay quiet, and let her think she’s won. I will sometimes even talk about the cat pilot to her as if I believe in it. I’ll say, for instance, Is that mouse/person screaming? I guess the cat pilot timed that paw swipe pretty well. But she knows that I haven’t given up, and what I’m really saying is, Robots: 1, Humans: 0. Loma and I like to go and look at the moon. The ravine is pretty high and narrow; the town is pretty bleak, and you can’t see that much sky out of it, but at least part of the night the moon is there, high up above, lifting its hand in greeting. So we go and climb the roof of the house across the way and lie on our backs staring up. I can understand why people would give up their lives for the moon. There really isn’t anything like it, even if people will tell you that other planets have their own moons, even moons that have their own moons, etc. In my particular predicament there is a thing called the moon, and whatever it is that would be analogous to the moon in someone else’s world, well, so be it. We meet down below, in the street, which of course is empty since there aren’t any cars anymore, with garbage blowing here and there. And it’s dark, real dark, and when we go through the front door of the house it’s even darker. Up the creaking stairs to the top floor, then up another staircase to the attic. And then out a hole we busted in the side of the roof, and there it is, flat as a plate, indomitable, patient: the moon, as if it’s been waiting for us for a thousand years, or a week. The moon is made of hours, but wants no part of it. Friendly moon. People say it’s at the heart of all disasters, like a patron saint, or a heresy. She’s got to be here when the dam goes, she being Loma, Loma is telling me. She says there’s nowhere better, better to be, than watching a dam collapse, and I think it’s the best thing she’s said yet. Being me, I point out that it’d be shortsighted to watch from down here, to which she says she already set up buckets on the cliff face, three buckets, for watching the disaster. Because it’s cool to sit on buckets the way workmen do. Who’s the third bucket for, Loma? I want to ask, but I don’t because either it’s for Elijah, which is some kind of old-timey joke like she’d make, or it’s for my Grandpa, which would be funny too. Loma: They were going to, you know, dynamite it, to know for sure when it would go, that’s what my dad said, but then they discovered that it would make them legally accountable for the collapse, whereas if they wait, it’ll be the firm that built the dam originally, which somehow is still in business a hundred years later, and so if it’s on their dime, well, it’s better for the city, even if it ends up catching someone unawares, so. She likes to end sentences that way sometimes, just with a “so.” An embarrassing thing I should tell you is that after we met I started doing it too, but just with Grandma Palavar. You can imagine how that worked out. Iggy, she said, nobody’s holding their breath for you to finish your bastardy little thoughts. Whatever you’ve got to say, spit it out and get on with the day. Saints alive but no one’s taught you a goddamn thing. Still I sometimes try it in the dark, repeating things Loma’s said, and then ending with “so.” I don’t even need to say things out loud to hear them like they’re out loud. Maybe it’s that way for everybody. I say things in my head and they sound like I’ve heard them. Sometimes it keeps me awake, the noise of all the talking that goes on. My dad said there’s a whole branch of philosophy just about that, and I could go to the library and read about it, but I don’t really care enough. My dad used to always trick me into finding things out that he couldn’t be bothered to. Then I’d say, Nothing for free in this life, Dad. Nothing for free. Grandma Palavar says we should write a letter to him in prison but we have to wait for him to write first, and I just know he won’t. I know he won’t. Something’s happened on the show that we don’t understand. It seems like the cat has gone over to the mice. That is, to the cause of the mice. First I thought something else had happened, and Loma did too, but then the narrative sounds just stopped making sense altogether, and also there was new theme music, one we hadn’t ever heard. Two of the mice had gotten cornered somewhere in the vestibule. From what we can gather that’s the worst place, the toughest spot to get caught. The mice are really afraid of it, they never go there unless they have to. But in this case, they got a little careless, I mean, this is what we gather happened. None of it is very clear. But all of a sudden there’s noise, like maybe one of the mice is dying, which, I mean, you remember, we’re talking about a woman or a man in a mouse costume, no? Not an actual mouse, or maybe a bit that way, but not all the way. So it could be that one of the mice is dead, but the other mouse, who must surely die too, somehow gets a reprieve. The cat seems to let him go. The death moment is odd, though. Specifically odd because it doesn’t sound like a mouse death. It sounds like a human death. I don’t know how much you know about mouse death or how much you know about human death. I don’t really know much about either, so maybe we are in the same boat. But I do know what “agreed-upon mouse death” should sound like, or at least, even if I couldn’t say what it was, I know it when I hear it, and what we heard on the show was something totally different, much more like what I’d imagine human death does sound like. I mean, not “agreed-upon human death noise,” but “true human death noise,” which would be, or is likely to be, something different. In other words, maybe, the mouse/human died and they just let the cameras run. Maybe it wasn’t supposed to go that way. But then would they be allowed to continue to run the program? Wouldn’t the family of the deceased mouse/human raise a fuss? Were there payoffs involved? Payoffs for the Japanese show, payoffs for the British version, payoffs for the American run? It isn’t clear how it would go. To be sure about what happens in the episode, because we only get to hear each show once, Loma and I use shorthand to write down what we’ve heard and then afterward we compare them. We’re not supposed to talk during the show. It would be too hard anyway ... writing things down is a lot of work, especially because my shorthand style is pretty terrible. Loma’s is better, but she actually took a class. The show ends with a loud tone that goes on for about four seconds. Then it’s silence, and then the next program, some kind of comedy with rowboats, comes on. As soon as the tone stops, we start chattering away—that’s usually. This time, we’re both just quiet. Just trying to figure out what we’ve heard. I’ve got this graph paper I was using to write on and I’m shuffling it, looking for the exact spot. My scrawls are all crazy. You know what shorthand looks like. It’s not easy street to decode, not even if you did it. Loma’s busy too, she keeps saying, I think, and then stopping, shuffle shuffle, I think, something like that, and then she’s like, I think Seventh Mouse is down. I think he went down. We number the mice to keep track of them, but even then it’s hard, because the voice acting doesn’t always seem to be consistent. Fourth Mouse and Ninth Mouse have basically the same voice, a thin voice. I can’t tell them apart. But, but maybe the cat’s a turncoat! Anyway, that’s what I say. Loma knows I’m on the cat side sometimes, and today is one of those times. I bitterly want the cat to win. But there are days when I’m with the mice. That’s true too. Seventh Mouse, Loma continues, he’s the one who makes all the plans. Without him, I just don’t think ... I just ... We’re quiet for a minute, and then she launches into some kind of theory about how her favorite band Pink Floyd lost Syd Barrett and then went on to somehow be even better, but I don’t think she believes it, at least as far as the ramifications with regard to Seventh Mouse and the mouse leadership on Bell the Cat. The mouse leadership is in tatters. That’s what I tell her. Just tatters. We talk for a while about a mouse funeral and what that would look like, and whether the cat would honor it, i.e., would it let the procession go through the house unmolested, or would the funeral just turn into a general slaughter? Or would the mice use a mouse funeral procession as a way to launch a surprise attack? Loma says I’m overthinking it. The cat doesn’t even remember that a mouse died. To him it’s a non-event. It is Loma’s birthday today, and I know that because Loma said to me a while back, Iggy, when you look out the window and see me standing in the street in a collared dress, that will be my birthday dress, it will be my birthday, and we will go up on top of the dam because why shouldn’t we. Everyone says, of course they do, don’t go up on the dam. Ignatius, don’t go up on the dam. Loma, don’t go up on the dam. Don’t go up on the dam. So of course we have to, because sooner or later there won’t be a dam to go up on, and then what? All these so-called people walking around with dead eyes because they never did a thing they wanted to, just following orders, etc. No way. So there it is, the tapping at the window. One little stone after another. I look down, bang! Collared dress, and such and such. I grab my worn-out desert boots and hotfoot it to the street. Loma’s got: herself, her dress, cheap ballet slippers, and a paper bag. In the paper bag is: little cakes her dad made her, some kind of foreign cakes. She tells me they’re good, and I say, Sure, Loma, I know they are. I know they are. I have a glass bottle of apple juice, a clasp knife, and a deck of cards. I give the cards to Loma. Aww, Ignatius, you didn’t have to. All kinds of stuff like that she says, and I say, Don’t think about it, it’s nothing. Anyway, they’re not new. My dad gave me them years ago, but I thought, I don’t know. You know what I mean? They’re, look, they have ... Oh, yeah, she says, I see. These are so cool. I never saw them in real life. Where did you? It was my dad, I said, he ... Oh, right, your dad ... Because the cards are for sailors, or people like that. They have very pretty naked girls, not photos but drawings, you know, in an old-fashioned kind of classic way. I went with that. Because you’re kind of a classic type of person, you know. I mean, I think we both ... Loma agrees that we are both a classic type of person, and it’s okay. The dirty-sailor-card gift goes over okay. She even gives me a hug, a quick hug, real quick, and then we’re walking toward the dam. I suddenly have the feeling it will be today. Today the dam will burst, Laskerville will be destroyed. Nothing will be the same again. Grandma Palaver will hear the crash and she won’t bat an eye. She won’t even stand up from her chair. I can’t even imagine that she’ll drown. She’ll just die sitting there, in the space between one moment and the next. I love that lady. Yeah, somehow it’s that day, and I know it’s that day, and maybe Loma doesn’t. I don’t know. But Loma and me, we start walking toward the dam. Or, not toward it, but kind of away from it. You have to walk away from it to get to it. That’s how things are, right?

        "story": "You never realize how accustomed your eye grows to a familiar variety of human species in a particular place, including that place’s indigenous freaks and weirdos, until a bizarre specimen native to elsewhere suddenly gets lost and wanders in and skews the mix. In Jerusalem, for example, who even bothers to look up when a prophet in the throes boards the light rail at the Mount Herzl military cemetery, or when a messiah in white robes astride a white donkey trots down Jaffa Road past the municipal center blowing his horn? A disorientation of this sort occurred not so long ago in the environs of Jerusalem’s Machane Yehuda market, when an extraordinary type began regularly to appear such as might be considered entirely normal and not meriting a second glance in the streets of New York City or San Francisco, but in Jerusalem would be a certified misfit and oddity, distorting the landscape utterly. From the shoulder and up this was a specimen taller than everyone else, husky in body, the face coated with a foundation base to mask the stubble that nevertheless relentlessly bored through, topped by a long wig with bangs fashioned from synthetic rodent-brown hair and a black felt pillbox hat for an added head covering. To the unclouded eye the specimen was male, yet dressed even so in a modest long black skirt from under which two giant feet in ladies’ pale-pink sneakers protruded, and to complete the ensemble a loose oversize sweater suggesting protrusions and indentations by blurring them, the entire outfit accessorized with a matching beige plastic handbag. For the zealots who absorbed her existence (yes, we honor her gender preference), the inconsistencies were non-negotiable, since as stated in the Book of Deuteronomy, a man is forbidden to put on the garments of a woman, this is abhorrent to God. What difference did it make if the cross-dressing male decked himself out as a devout woman of faith? It is a sin. Still, apart from the discordance of her costume, in every other respect she seemed to conduct herself in public as befits a decent Jewish matron, and except for the disturbance in the field of her very presence itself, she made no trouble at all. In good weather she passed much of the day sitting on a bench in one of the small courtyard parks of the gentrified Nachlaot neighborhood across from the market, her head bent over a miniature Book of Psalms, now and then drawing out from her plaid shopping wagon a dented tin can with a faded Beit Hashita pickles label still stuck to it, thrusting it out toward a passerby who might drop in a shekel or, as regrettably happened a number of times, spit into the can in an expression of righteous disapproval. In the evening she rolled the cart into the market to stock up on some fruits and vegetables and maybe half a loaf of bread and a piece of pink herring as a treat, radically reduced in price at the close of the business day. Nobody knew where she lived—definitely not in new-age Nachlaot, which, unless she was a mad mogul in disguise, would have been well beyond her plastic pocketbook’s clasp. Local mystics claimed she descended every night into a cell underground where the forgotten sisters burrowed and from which they sometimes flashed forth when the streets emptied out to scavenge among the rotting leftovers. Nor did anyone know her name, though a recent returnee to the faith married to the only man in Nachlaot who did not own a guitar reported that on one occasion she had “reached out” to this lost soul and had ventured to ask. What followed was a reddening of the face burning fiercely even through the layers of skin paste studded with bristle, a sputtering denoting an effort to control spasms bordering dangerously on rage, as if a sacred line had been crossed into a forbidden zone, as if the questioner had taken an impermissible liberty, violated a hallowed privacy, dared to inquire after the name and all the secrets it revealed—Rumpelstiltskin? Yahweh? The Tetragrammaton itself, never to be pronounced out loud? At last a hormonally unmistakable voice was heard. Call me Boosha, it resonated—on the face of it a proper feminine-sounding name with an “ah” ending. Yet, as everyone knows, boosha means shame. The curious fact is that even when she lived in America, when she was a boy growing into a man among the insular, ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidim in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, no one seemed to know his name either (we are now officially regressing to the birth-assignment pronoun). Even from his first day at cheder, when he was only three years old and his hair was cut for the first time (silken blond curls that his mother kept in a bag with the first shearing of all his brothers), everyone called him Schulman, which of course was his surname. He had been a sizable child, from the start bulkier than average on the growth chart, tending toward a corporeal sponginess, and it was said that his own father also called him Schulman—Schulman 11, as that was his number in a family of fifteen offspring. In his early twenties, however, he acquired a title—Rabbi—conferred upon him by the head of his small yeshiva—a private seminary operating from the basement of a split-level house in the Satmar village of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, New York—who, by virtue of having been certified in Jewish law, had earned the right to lay on hands and transmit to his students the title along with the clerical privilege to teach and instruct on all matters forbidden and permitted. In this way Schulman transitioned into Rabbi Schulman and, for all intents and purposes, Rabbi became his first name. In his rabbinical practice, he inclined toward ruling on the forbidden, that was his preference; when in doubt, he played it safe and forbade. Yet everyone agreed that in matters of law he could be relied upon for scrupulousness and incorruptibility. It goes without saying that he never served as the type of synagogue rabbi familiar to most enlightened audiences, enthroned up there on an elevated platform in front of the congregation, draped in a rich prayer shawl and skullcap, now and then approaching the podium to announce in pontifical tones, Please turn to page such-and-such in your prayer books, All members rise, and so on. In fact, in his entire career he never held a pulpit at all, spending the major portion of the first two decades of his rabbinical service primarily as a pitifully underpaid teacher of aleph-bet and of basic holy studies and religious practice to very young boys. He was known for his strictness, even physically striking on occasion the troublemakers and daydreamers, sometimes using a ruler or a strap with the full approval of the parents, yet he was also appreciated for what was regarded as his kind heart. Passersby would marvel at how on the hottest days of the year, when the children were running around like liberated chickens and playing so intensely in the yard during their recess, their side curls plastered to their red flushed faces, fringed ritual garments clinging with sweat to their soaked white shirts, he would shuttle tirelessly back and forth, filling and refilling a watering can and sprinkling the boys with water as if they were flowers. He also had a side job, for which he was paid nothing at all but which mattered to him vitally, endowing his days and especially his nights with drama and life, filling him with purpose. He was a Hatzolah volunteer, a first responder in his local free ambulance service, the original Williamsburg branch that had pioneered the whole movement dedicated to the rapid emergency rescue of all people in distress regardless of race or religion but, as everyone knew, specializing in Jewish troubles and afflictions, which its Jewish volunteers knew so personally from the inside and therefore could handle with impeccable precision and delicacy. It was because of Schulman’s acts of loving-kindness that, when finally, after much searching, a wife was found for him and it was deemed necessary that he earn a proper living to support his future family, God willing, community leaders banded together and found for him a respectable job to go with the wife, drawing on their connections and clout even outside their immediate tight circles to arrange for him to be hired by the local Modern Orthodox rabbinical council to serve as the official shaliach in its divorce court. It was a job for which he was judged to be perfectly qualified, as he was neither deaf, dumb, nor blind, he was not a heathen or an imbecile, and so on as stipulated, he had a beard and side curls that proclaimed him to be reassuringly authentic, the real thing, and he also had his rabbinical degree as a seal of authority. What the job entailed was to stand in as the agent for a man who, for one reason or another, could not personally be present to hand the divorce document to his wife as was mandated. Maybe the guy was too busy, maybe he had moved to a different country, maybe he just couldn’t bear the sight of her one second longer. In such cases—and they occurred far more often than anyone might have imagined—Schulman would act as the designated agent or proxy on the divorcer’s behalf. He was in his early forties when he was married, well past the recommended age of eighteen for a man to stand under the wedding canopy, though eighteen, as it happened, was how old his bride was, more than two decades younger than him, plucked fresh from another generation. Everyone looked at each other and asked the obvious question—Nu, so what’s wrong with her?—and especially because she was from such an illustrious family, a descendant of the Hasidic Chernobyl Rebbe—The Chernobyler himself—under normal circumstances the most aristocratic of husbands in her own age bracket from the most distinguished of dynasties would have been found for her. But then there were the rumors, already bouncing along the airwaves for at least two years, that she had been caught more than once at a public library or in a profane café rapt in front of a computer screen, which was strictly forbidden and for good reason, that she had been seen talking to boys and other strays outside the local kosher pizza store and at other even less savory venues, and that on another occasion she had been spotted standing in line with all kinds of lowlife and bums waiting to get into a live concert of some pagan sort in Greenwich Village, a place with a reputation and fate even worse than Sodom. Clearly this was an emergency, something needed to be done instantly to save her, the obvious solution was to marry her off at once. Her name was Basha, and to her mother and everyone else’s surprise, when she was shown a picture of Schulman as potential husband material, she stared at it for a long time and did not make a face or stick a finger down her throat as if she were gagging, as some girls in their bridal hour had been known to do when presented with potential candidates. In contrast, Basha for her part merely shrugged and said, Why not? Since the hot weather had already set in, it was then proposed that, because this was such an important life decision not to be taken lightly, just to be certain, she station herself across the street from the schoolyard and observe how Schulman so sweetly watered the boys. Basha stood there and watched for less than a minute, then turned to the matchmaker who had accompanied her and said, Okay, sure, he can shpritz me too. She did not mean this in any way irreverent or flippant or lascivious, God forbid, the matchmaker insisted when she recounted Basha’s response during Sabbath prayers behind the opaque screen in the ladies’ section of the synagogue. She meant it in the most positive way: Schulman would cultivate her, he would help her to sprout and blossom into a proper woman of valor. After all, he was nearly legendary for his rescue work as a Hatzolah volunteer. So now he would save Basha too, not only her body but more crucially her soul. He was more than twice her age, a fact that did not escape Schulman himself, friends with whom he had grown up and had sat beside on the same bench learning in yeshiva for years already had daughters as old as she, already married, already pushing double strollers down Lee Avenue. Nor did it go unnoticed by Schulman himself as well as by others that his marriage inauspiciously aligned with the start of his new job in the divorce court, essentially falling within the same window of time. Well-meaning people rejected the notion that this coincidence was a bad omen, insisting instead that as a certified rescuer who in his Hatzolah role pulls the victim out of the lowest depths to full recovery, Schulman would also extract from his daily immersion in the scum of divorce the wisdom that is required to maintain the good health of a marriage. In the divorce court, as it turned out, it wasn’t such a casual matter for Schulman to face one strange woman after another standing there opposite him with her hands cupped together in front of her like a beggar as she had been instructed to do by the presiding Modern Orthodox rabbi, into which, acting for the husband, he, Schulman, was obliged to drop the get document after speaking on the husband’s behalf the words, You are hereby permitted to all men. Certainly he was not offended by this ancient formulation for the sake of the woman, like some unnatural and perverse male feminist acting against his own interests; it would in fact never have occurred to him to see anything amiss with this statement. After all, the Torah states that only a man has the power to initiate a divorce, he could get rid of his wife for a good reason or for no reason at all—because she burned his soup, because he woke up one morning and found her repulsive, that’s just how it was, straightforward, plain and simple. Schulman was only affirming the obvious as the husband’s spokesman, he was releasing her to go her way, he was letting it be known to all and sundry that she was available, that she would get what she deserved. Yet it happened to him more than once that when he spoke those words, glancing down from under his brow at the soon to be divorced female standing across from him with her supplicant’s hands cupped together, he would see his own wife Basha there in her place like an apparition, her small form modestly attired as is required and her head encased in a proper matron’s wig with a little hat perched on top. It would be Basha there with her hands out assuming the position to receive the bill of divorce, lifting it up as instructed to acknowledge receipt, acceptance, then tucking it under her arm against the warmth and privacy of her body as if claiming the document as her own personal property, turning her back, the backside of a woman that strangers ogle automatically as their inalienable right, and walking a few paces down the runway symbolically into the future, marked forever as a discarded woman. Quickly he would seek to cast off the intrusion of this vision—what did the thoughts such as they were of Basha or any other female matter in a situation involving grave religious strictures? Even more acutely, it troubled him that these disturbing Basha emanations in the divorce court meant that in his heart he felt himself to be the unfortunate husband of a problem female, a girl suffering from influences. Not that he knew for a fact that she might have opinions deviant or otherwise on this or on any subject. They never discussed such lofty matters, or, as was proper, rarely talked at length or in depth about anything other than basic day-to-day household operations and schedules, they were separated not only by sex, which was hazardous enough, but also by years, a nearly insurmountable gap. She left their apartment early to attend her occupational therapy training program, the perfect career choice for the lifestyle of an observant Jewish woman looking forward to the blessing of a large family—flexible hours and workplaces, some much appreciated extra income as the secondary wage earner, it made such practical sense, everyone was astonished that she had chosen this sensible profession but at the same time they were delighted, thrilled, relieved, the realities of marriage had matured her as is inevitably the outcome sooner or later. And while Schulman continued his volunteer work at Hatzolah, which regularly summoned him out of his warm bed at all hours of the night, so, too, Basha staggered into her cold bed often past midnight after fulfilling her requirements as an OT on-call intern, depleted from her labors nurturing the disabled and the injured, she turned her back, drew the quilt over her head, curled up, and, like the child she was, instantly fell asleep, breathing so softly. When it happened that Schulman would venture past the nightstand separating their two beds and alarm her with a tap on the shoulder, almost invariably she would mumble that it was, you know, her time of the month, or that she had not found a free moment yet to go to the mikvah and immerse herself in compliance with the laws of family purity—Sorry Schulman, not tonight. Once again he was reminded of how irregular she was as he plodded back to his own barren bed. In this way more than a year passed since the wedding, and still nothing doing, as the neighborhood chorus intoned. He threw himself more intensely into his job as the shaliach in the rabbinic court, devoting an unprecedented amount of time to painstakingly checking the twelve lines of the bill of divorce written by the scribe in the husband’s name, on whose behalf he, Schulman, was acting. Because of his meticulousness in examining the document, the entire divorce procedure often stretched well beyond the two hours or so allotted for it, slowing down the assembly line, the two male witnesses flipping back the cuffs of their suit jackets and glancing at their watches over and over again as Schulman, heedless, went on with his checking. Opposite him as he checked sat the soon to be ex-wife, usually accompanied for emotional support by a female family member or friend, both women wringing their hands or panting in agitation as Schulman sat at the table poring over the get, his head bent over the writing, entirely oblivious to their distress. It was not uncommon for one or even both of the women to spontaneously burst out crying, clutching each other as they sobbed and not letting go, and there was even an occasion when the wife waiting to be released passed out completely, slid off her chair onto the floor and banged her head, requiring emergency medical intervention from Schulman as a certified Hatzolah volunteer, immediate ambulance transport to the hospital, where she received thirteen stitches, forcing the prolongation of her marriage due to the need to reschedule her divorce appointment. Letter by letter, pointing with a thick finger, Schulman went over those twelve lines of the get written by the scribe in Aramaic, checking for errors, focusing in particular on the accuracy of the names of the divorcing parties and the names of their fathers, of the city in which the divorce was taking place and its nearest bodies of water, of the date, so that there could never be any doubt that it was the divorce of this couple and of no other couple on the face of the earth. When Schulman would spot something suspicious, he would get up and shuffle, head lowered, to the next room, where the scribe sat ready with ink and quill to make a correction, at times minor, but on other occasions requiring even a complete rewrite at Schulman’s behest as the husband’s emissary. He would vanish for an excruciating stretch of time, like a surgeon privately consulting with colleagues and other experts, examining with them the images and test results, reappearing at last to face those condemned to wait with the fatal diagnosis and give them the news. Complaints began to pour in, but the Modern Orthodox court was loathe to dismiss such a genuine article as Schulman for what could only be interpreted as exemplary piety—to do so would certainly not reflect well on their institution. As a consequence of this situation, however, more and more wives tried to outsource—to request that proxies be appointed to accept the get on their behalf, which remarkably was their right. Now when the husband showed up but not the wife, Schulman was obliged as the official court shaliach to act as her surrogate, to take on her role, to be her agent, all of this, as Schulman knew, possible according to the oral law. And in those instances when both the husband and the wife failed to appear, the court usually opted to assign to Schulman the role of the wife, since the wife’s part involved nothing potentially more complex or time-consuming than to receive the document—to just take it and walk. A surrogate was then found to serve as the agent on the husband’s behalf, male or female, incredibly it made no difference at all, either was acceptable. Schulman had even heard of a case in which a woman acting as the shaliach for the husband delivered the get to a wife who turned out to be herself, a feat of acrobatics too twisted to imagine, a mockery. It was a sordid business, he had not expected this. It had never been explicitly stated in the job description that he could be put in the position of impersonating the woman, acting as the woman’s understudy receiving the document from another woman playing the man, who more and more now when he ventured to look had Basha’s face. On the deepest level, Schulman felt himself to be defiled and ridiculed by his participation in the whole process, the butt of a joke perpetrated by the too-clever Talmudists seeking to one-up each other with preposterous possibilities, having their fun at Schulman’s expense. Yet even in that dark hour at least there was Hatzolah, and it was there that Schulman sought refuge. Spiritually, the rescue service now was rescuing him, delivering him from the mire, not letting him sink—deep down Schulman recognized this truth. He dedicated himself to Hatzolah with even greater ardor than before, never failing to remind the dispatchers of his complete full-time availability, nothing was more important than coming to the rescue of the sick, the wounded, the victims of water, fire, sword, wild beasts, pogroms, and so on, he craved the jolt of the radio summons to an emergency day or night, it was a reprieve from the confusion of his life. And even though such a call inevitably heralded the suffering of another human being or, in drawing him away from the court, prolonged the torment of a marriage by interrupting or even postponing a divorce procedure already scheduled or in progress, it nevertheless goes without saying that saving a life—and how much more so the life of a fellow Jew—always takes precedence, as everyone knows, trumping even the Sabbath. Indeed, the Sabbath was usually one of Hatzolah’s busiest times, possibly due to the overeating that was among the highlights of the day—heart attacks, strokes, ulcer flare-ups, complete prostration due to the cholent and the kugel. Babies were also known to be born on the Sabbath, they were not always so considerate as to wait for a weekday when it is permissible to drive or be driven to the hospital, women in their capricious way went into labor on the Sabbath and holidays too, even Yom Kippur. Regardless what day, he, Schulman, and his partner, Kaplan from the hardware store, always got the job done, in the worst-case scenario, with as much modesty and discretion as was humanly possible, especially when dealing with those ladies from the community who were giving birth to their eighth or twelfth or to their number-who’s-counting, which always came fast and faster, they practically spit them out—only not, as Kaplan liked to remind him, you should excuse me, not from the mouth. Schulman and Kaplan were a team. For their dedication and overall excellence they had been rewarded with the distinction of being assigned their own ambulance, their own designated gleaming red-and-white chariot of healing with the shield on each door, donated by professor dr. mendy pfeffer, phd and family. There was nothing better than riding to the rescue together in the Pfeffer ambulance, bonding in their sealed vehicle, men only (not counting now and then the patient who of course by definition was a nonparticipant), their response time was unmatched, they knew their territory cold. In their day-to-day life they might be treated like losers, but in the ambulance they were heroes whom everyone in trouble awaited, like the messiah, yet unlike the messiah, they actually arrived. Schulman’s territory encompassed the Williamsburg of his childhood, the very area in which he had lived his entire life and where he still resided as a married man with Basha his wife. He knew this territory like the back of his hand, backward and forward, every street and alley, every apartment and hole in the wall. His partner Kaplan was sensitive enough never to risk insulting him unforgivably by turning on the GPS when racing together to a call, sirens blaring—GPSchulman, he called him. Directed by Schulman they never failed to pull up to the exact destination in record time. Schulman also knew his clientele inside out, mostly Satmar Hasidim who kept themselves so apart except by necessity when it came to business and money, reaching in rather than reaching out, his own people, their aches and pains, which one was a chronic complainer and which a real case demanding extreme alertness, the subtleties and nuances of handling them professionally yet respectfully. It’s true of course that Hatzolah was committed to transporting not only Jews, generously it answered the cry of all, whoever was in need or distress, the mixed mob, free emergency ambulance service for all as stated in the Declaration of Independence. But as it happened Schulman’s Williamsburg territory was almost entirely Jewish, even on the other side of Broadway that the kids had taken over, the hipsters and the artistes with their cafés and clubs who were such a dangerous influence on the pious youth on the good side still following the correct path—even those spoiled brats in their ironic black clothing and thrift shop rags were almost all Jewish, with Jewish papas who paid top dollar for the wrecked apartments and broken-down storefronts they bought and redecorated so outrageously without even wall-to-wall carpeting, almost one hundred percent of this now wildly overpriced real estate owned as it happened by the Satmars from the other God-fearing side. In any case, most of these hipsters were still young and in general did not require the service of an ambulance; in their pride and arrogance they weren’t yet afflicted with the ailments that would inevitably catch up with them in time as Schulman knew very well, the kinds of urgent breakdowns that made up the bulk of his business from the side where he and the faithful dwelt. There was the occasional bicycle accident on the hipster side, more often a substance abuse issue such as a drug reaction or overdose. Most of the time these kids didn’t know better and dialed 9-1-1, but if by chance they called Hatzolah, which usually occurred when the victim was a former Satmar seduced by these sinners now rightfully getting what he or maybe even she deserved, certainly Schulman and Kaplan swung into action at once and got the job done. So when a call came that summer after midnight from one of the fabulously high-priced boutique hotels that had sprung up on the hipster side that a kid had fallen into the swimming pool at some kind of party on the roof and they were having problems getting his breathing going, Schulman and Kaplan grabbed their gear and set out at once. “Probably from all that junk they stick up their noses or into their you-know-whats,” Kaplan was saying in the car when the phone rang. It was Srulik, the owner of the hotel, who sat in the front row in Schulman’s shul, one of the wealthiest members of their community. “What’s taking you so long?” Srulik was yelling in Yiddish. “Do you realize who this kid’s father is in the mayor’s office? We’re gonna lose all our benefits if you don’t get here this minute, and I’m gonna be sued right out of my gatkes.” They arrived at the hotel in almost no time and ran up the stairs, maybe ten flights, lugging all their equipment, including the oxygen, which Kaplan as a paramedic had been trained to administer. With the lights flashing, the music blasting almost as loud as at a Jewish wedding, the DJ on the mic pulsating nonstop, kids naked and almost naked dancing in what looked like an ecstatic trance, like Hasidim in the aura of their rebbe, writhing and jerking in the pool and out, their eyeballs rolled back in their heads, it was difficult at first to identify the injured party. The bouncer at the entrance, bigger even than Schulman, a giant like an unmovable boulder, finally detached from his guard position and led them to the casualty—a skinny kid with a Star of David tattoo on the side of his neck retching between two lounge chairs, surrounded by some misfits unable to grasp the party spirit, one of them trying perfunctorily to administer a version of CPR or some other type of lifesaving technique, maybe Chinese or holistic. Schulman and Kaplan cleared the area and went to work at once as the music kept on pounding. The kid would make it. Thank God, he’ll live, Kaplan muttered grimly. Even so, Kaplan intubated him through the nose as a precaution, maybe simply because he could, or maybe just to teach the kid a lesson. They lashed him to a stretcher to transport him to the hospital to be checked out and triaged into the detox system most probably, paying no attention at all to the crowd amassing around them as always happened when they worked—humans were drawn to disasters like flies to fresh dung—until one of these bystanders raised her female voice and cried out, “Stop the music, I need to say something!” By some miracle, silence descended, and Schulman looked up. It was the voice of a young woman standing arm in arm with another girl, both of them wearing only what looked like their underwear, wet patches almost transparent barely covering their essential power points. For some reason, as would happen to him in the divorce court, she morphed before his eyes into the image of his wife Basha, but of course this could not have been Basha because Basha was at her occupational therapy on-call internship, and anyway he had never seen Basha standing up in or out of her underwear wet or dry, and certainly he had never seen her standing up outside in the open air practically naked, which no good Jewish woman would ever do except when being rounded up and shot by Nazis. “Listen up, guys,” she was articulating slowly, as if dredging up an entirely new thought, never before brought to light. “This is so wow. Unbelievable. This big guy here with the cool beard and cute ear curls? He’s my guy, it’s Schulman, like, I’m like married to him. Yeah, this dude is my husband according to the laws of Moses and Israel.” She passed a little giggle. “And for your information, Schulman here doesn’t just rescue assholes stoned out of their minds flipping into pools, no way,” she went on, one word dragging after another. “He’s my rescuer too. For sure. He rescued me from my house of bondage, the house of my mother and father. He was my ticket out. Marrying Schulman, that was the first step out the door. And guess what? He’s also a divorce guru. So next step he gives me my divorce and—walla!—I’m gone, totally, one hundred percent. Free at last! Thank God Almighty—and thank you, Schulman! Schulman, you’re my hero. Stand up and take a bow, Schulman. Let everyone see you, man.” As if from behind a screen, like a cataract clouding his vision, they were all smiling at him, applauding. Schulman wondered if it was because he had actually taken a bow. Could he really have been swayed to do such a thing? Jews do not bow down to humans or idols, only to God is it permissible. The divorce took place within the month at the Modern Orthodox rabbinic court. Neither Schulman nor Basha made a personal appearance. Each was represented by a proxy, both women. To Schulman it seemed as if forces beyond his control were more and more conspiring to assign to him the role of a woman, reducing him for his sins to a woman, sending him a message. In such a debased form it was no longer possible for him to remain in his holy community. There is only one place a Jew can go when everywhere else he turns he is degraded, even a Satmar Jew who rejects the existence of the Zionist state as heresy and continues to faithfully await the coming of the messiah at the appointed hour. Schulman made his way to Israel as to a prison, to serve out his life sentence as a woman. As Schulman was sitting hunched on a bench in Nachlaot one morning some years later beside the plaid shopping wagon, reading over and over again from the miniature Book of Psalms the verse “God will help her at the approach of morning,” two women approached, one of them with a baby harnessed to her breast. Boldly the mother with her baby approached and said, “Schulman, you’ve transitioned. Mazel tov!” What is this “transitioned”? Schulman was thinking, but Basha did not elaborate, she only went on to introduce her girlfriend as her wife, another incomprehensible revelation, and the baby trussed to her chest as their daughter, Menachem Nachum, named for her famous ancestor, the Chernobyl Rebbe. Then Basha looked at Schulman, not without tenderness, and said, “Well, maybe you’re just gender-fluid, Schulman. That’s also okay. Whatever your choice—male, female, all or none of the above—it’s all good.” Schulman did not know what gender-fluid was, maybe some kind of liquid having to do with matters decent people do not discuss except with a licensed practitioner. Schulman also did not think it was all good. From the earliest years of her life she had sat among the men and boys reciting the morning blessings, thanking God for not having made her a woman—so how could it be all good? Women were God’s afterthought. She wanted to explain this to Basha but did not know if it was permissible to prolong the conversation as they no longer were married. But then she remembered that now they both were women in the eyes of the world, it was only women’s talk, of no account, so she said, “Against my will I have been turned into a woman. It is my punishment, my penance. See what has become of me.” Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. is the author, most recently, ofThe House of Love and Prayer: and Other Stories. “An unexpectedly excellent magazine that stands out amid a homogenized media landscape.” —the New York Times"

        "story": "She didn’t believe in ghosts until her mother started talking to her on Mount Archer in the Pleasant Valley Preserve in southeastern Connecticut. She was stretching her calves in the little parking lot by the trailhead when she heard, clear as day, “Come on, Jessie. Enough now.” Clear as day? She hated the clichés that crowded her mind when she thought of her mother. Clear as her mother’s voice, gone three years, buried five states away, at the top of no mountain. The second time it happened she had just started her hike and was thinking about bears. She’d heard that one had been spotted in New London County, and she was trying to remember the protocol for encountering different wildlife. Were you supposed to make yourself big or small? Loud or quiet? Back away or—no, she didn’t think you were ever supposed to stand your ground. Then her mother said, “I never wanted you to be this sad.” That stopped her in her tracks (cliché). Was this happening because the top of the mountain was closer to heaven? Her mother had believed in heaven. At least she had at one time. That was actually something Jessie wished she’d had a chance to clarify: whether at the time of her death her mother still believed in heaven. The trees surrounding the parking lot made a circle, their canopies framing a dome of sky. It felt vaguely church-like. The next time she went up Mount Archer she took a friend. This was a test, absolutely, but she was also worried about the bear. Her neighbor’s dog, Minty, had disappeared. There were posters all over town. The neighbor, whose property abutted the preserve, was offering a generous reward, but no one believed the little terrier was coming back. They arrived in Diana’s car, with water bottles and granola bars, though they intended to hike only a mile or two. What Jessie had told Diana was that she’d been exploring the Pleasant Valley trails lately and thinking of her mom. She had not mentioned ghosts. She walked over to the map board, but all she heard was the wind through the now bare trees. She touched her toes. One of her knees cracked, but otherwise, silence. Diana looked over. “You okay?” What could she say? Do I seem haunted? “Did you and your mother like to hike?” Diana asked. Jessie and Diana had been friends for twenty years. They’d celebrated baby and marriage milestones, shared vacations, and helped each other raise three girls and one boy between them. Diana’s youngest, Thomas, was the last one at home. But Diana had never met Jessie’s mother. Diana’s father had died a few years ago and Jessie had never met him. They each had people inside their heads whom the other would never know. “Oh. No,” Jessie said. “Not really.” Tip of the iceberg. Jessie read that it takes ten years for a body to decompose in a coffin. Ten years! She and her husband had ten years left on their mortgage. In ten years, all the snow leopards and polar bears might be gone. Part of the problem was that she thought her parents had planned to be cremated, but in the final weeks of her mother’s grim decline, grief-stricken, trying to think of everything, her father asked her mother what she wanted and her mother changed her mind. He went to the town cemetery and bought two plots the next day and now there were two headstones, side by side, one with the dates complete, the other still waiting. Jessie thought about all of this far too much. Also, her mother’s lips. When she last saw them they were not right. The mortician had arranged them into an expression she didn’t recognize, which was a shame for an enormous number of reasons, not least because her mother had had a beautiful mouth. She did remember thinking, Oh, but she’s not here. She’s gone. Her spirit was so obviously gone. At the time, it was almost a comfort. But why had her spirit come to the top of Mount Archer? Jessie resumed her solo walks and didn’t hear anything for some time. Then, on a cold December Sunday, her mother said, “I always loved my birthday.” Jessie closed her eyes. It was indeed her mother’s birthday and she had forgotten. Her mother did love her birthday. And flowers. And children’s books. She’d been very good at reading them aloud, perhaps because of some theatrical training she’d had in her youth. She could make you feel the pathos of an empty cupboard, a rainy day, a child turned cruel because she was hurt. “Happy Birthday, Mom,” Jessie wrote with a stick in the snow. Wildlife that Jessie spotted on Mount Archer: Squirrels, always so surprisingly loud in the dry leaves. Deer, rabbit, chipmunks. Many birds: chickadees, cardinals, the occasional red-winged blackbird although the river was not near. On the wilder end: a coyote, twice, and possibly a bobcat—she wasn’t sure. Never the bear, though several people were reporting missing chickens. In her last years, Jessie’s mother had been preoccupied with the plight of a series of endangered species. First whales, then snow leopards, and finally gray wolves. She donated to various wildlife charities, and soon it became all but impossible for her to watch a nature documentary; all the hunting, and the abandoning of cubs, was too upsetting. Jessie’s last gift to her mother had been a donation to a wildlife fund that came with a plush snow leopard. But in her final days her mother clutched a candy-orange stuffed tiger that a nurse had given her instead. In the spring Jessie was again stretching before a walk, touching her toes, her eyes closed against the tightness in her hamstrings, when she heard a twig snap. She jumped straight up, but it was only a small woman, dressed in an oversize sweatshirt and flip-flops, coming up the trail. “Sorry to startle you!” the woman called. She held her arms up in apology so that she looked like a flying squirrel. “I thought you were the bear,” Jessie said. “Oh, is that real?” “I heard there was one.” “I saw some scat on the trail. But I couldn’t identify it. I don’t know that sort of thing.” Jessie resumed stretching. The disparity in their footwear embarrassed her. The woman’s toes were all chapped and red. “Enjoy your walk,” the woman said. She waved and went to her car, her flip-flops thwacking. Then it was summer and the Minty posters were still up, though now faded and torn. Minty had never been found. There was a new notice predicting a bad tick season and an official one cautioning hikers to watch out for bears. Some evidence suggested that one bear, perhaps more than one, had crossed to the east side of the Connecticut River for the first time. The notice recommended carrying a bell. Jessie did not have a bell, but just then she heard one. “Oh, come on,” she said. “What?” said her mother. “Don’t overreact.” “No, don’t say that. Say something else.” “What do you mean?” “Say something you don’t always say. We can’t just keep going over the same material.” “A lot of people think that’s easy, but it’s not.” “A lot of people.” “What?” “Who? Where are they? Do you know a lot of people?” “I don’t know why you’re so upset.” “I’m not upset.” “I never know what will upset you.” “Nope.” “Fine. I won’t say anything.” “Well, that would be preferable. Is it an option?” Jessie had heard other people say about their loved ones, We said all we had to say. Or, There was nothing left unsaid between us. How marvelous. Jessie was well aware that she and her mother had not said enough. She joined groups. Read books. Tried meditation and yoga. She wished she could be like the writer who planted white pine seedlings around her cabin when her mother died and believed she heard her voice in the wind through the branches. That seemed nice. She felt more affinity with the man who believed his mother had come back as a cardinal, which was fine until the bird killed itself fighting its own reflection in his kitchen window. All that summer Jessie hiked Mount Archer. She saw dogs on leads, dogs off leads. Once, a cat in a backpack. Never a bear. She saw the flip-flop woman again in August. “Hi!” she called as she came up the trail into the parking area. “I’m Bobby.” Jessie waved. She checked the noticeboard. Another dog was lost, though at least it wasn’t her neighbor’s new one, Honey, who looked just like Minty. Bobby came over. “Do you usually walk far?” she asked. Jessie looked at her feet. “I guess so. A few miles.” Bobby lifted a flip-flop. “I don’t really come to walk. I go to a place near that big boulder on the blue trail? I just . . . it sounds crazy.” She picked a piece of mulch off her toe. “My sister died last year and I feel close to her up here. That’s crazy, right?” “Oh, well.” Jessie chose her next words carefully. “I lost my mom a few years ago and I would say Mount Archer has been playing a unique role in my own grieving.” “Really?” Bobby said with enthusiasm. “I’m sorry. I mean I’m sorry for your loss. But can I ask you—do you talk to her here?” “Actually, she does most of the talking.” “Oh, god! Same!” Bobby said that she wasn’t religious, nor did she have any other “woo-woo beliefs,” but she thought Mount Archer was a place where souls paused before whatever came next. “I mean, I just feel like I have the evidence,” she said. “This is the only place where Joy talks to me.” She said someone had told her about Mount Osore in northern Japan and she knew right away that Mount Archer was the same kind of place. “It’s much taller, isn’t it?” Jessie asked. “Mount Osore?” Bobby frowned. “I don’t think that matters.” When Jessie told Diana she’d met a woman who talked to her dead sister on Mount Archer, Diana told her a story she hadn’t shared before. A few days after her father died, she’d been in the car with Thomas when they heard—both of them heard—a few measures of Mozart’s Agnus Dei, which her father had loved. Thomas reached over to turn the volume up, only to realize the radio wasn’t on. They were stopped at a light, but there were no other cars around. They were nowhere near a church. “I mean, there has to be an explanation,” Diana said. “But we’ve never been able to figure it out.” The following week, Jessie and Bobby pulled into the parking lot at the same time. “I wondered if I’d see you again. Hi!” “Here I am,” Jessie said. “So, what’s your mother’s name?” Jessie winced, partly because of the present tense and partly because she knew what was coming. “Grace,” she said. Bobby’s eyes widened. “No way! Joy and Grace! What are the chances?” She rubbed the back of her neck. “I used to tell Joy she had the wrong name because she had none. Ha. Sisters. Do you have any?” Jessie shook her head. She couldn’t figure out how to convincingly delay at the car, so they started up the blue trail together. At the boulder, she said goodbye. “Have a good talk, I mean walk,” Bobby said. Jessie didn’t smile. “They’re just keeping us company for a bit before they leave for good, is the way I see it,” Bobby added. Jessie’s mother was quiet until the summit. “You told your friend I didn’t like to hike. Not this new friend, the other one.” Jessie waited. “I don’t know about hike. I never liked that word. I loved to walk and you know it. Remember New York? Remember that summer near the Champ de Mars?” She did. “We walked around it every night, sometimes three times.” Jessie’s knees went weak and she sunk to the ground in a crouch. Weak in the knees. Maybe clichés were there to rescue us from the strongest emotions. “Is this a haunting or are you just remembering?” her mother asked. “Is there a difference?” Jessie said to the forest floor. Mount Archer was hardly a mountain. It was called that simply because at 450 feet above sea level, it was the highest point of elevation for miles around. Mountain or molehill, Jessie suspected there was not a lot that she and Bobby had in common off of it. Her mother seemed to agree. “She’s a lot younger than you,” she said one day. “And you saw the bumper sticker?” “I did. It’s disappointing. But I don’t mind her.” “Neither do I.” Bobby seemed too thin, almost undernourished, as though she might not have enough money for groceries. She never wore anything other than the same giant gray sweatshirt, she had a discolored tooth on the upper right of her mouth, and her hair was poorly cut in layers that looked like they had once been dyed pink and purple. Her sister was a suicide. That’s the way she said it one day, a suicide, not that she had committed suicide, which is how Jessie might have said it. “Shot herself,” Bobby said. “Oh, god. I’m sorry.” “In the chest. The coroner told me that some people who try it that way miss and just end up with a collapsed lung.” “How was Mount Osore today?” Jessie’s husband asked. She put her forehead in her hands. “Please don’t call it that.” “Sorry. Mount Olympus?” “There are no gods up there. Just two women and their ghosts.” He came over and rubbed her back. “I’ve lost track,” he said. “Is this a fairy tale or a ghost story?” “I wish I knew. Both?” Was there once an archer of Mount Archer? A Diana, goddess of the hunt, of Pleasant Valley? Was there a story that could explain what was going on? Jessie went to the town archive to look. From the town’s founding in the seventeenth century, the land had been part of a farm that was owned by three families before it was given to the trust. No story of a heroic local archer; no part of the mountain shaped like a bow. A dead end. Afterward, she went to a café in town and while waiting in line, she noticed Bobby and another woman having coffee. She grabbed her cup and went over. “Hi,” Bobby said, not smiling. “How are you?” Jessie had never seen her so quiet and formal. “Oh, good. I just wanted to say hi.” “Hi,” Bobby said again, then looked nervously at the woman she was with. It was clear she didn’t know how to introduce Jessie. “We walk together sometimes,” Bobby finally explained. Jessie smiled. “Yes, actually it’s good to see you somewhere else. I was starting to doubt you were real.” The woman looked down and Bobby made a face. “This is my sister Amanda. She doesn’t think I should walk on Mount Archer anymore.” “Do you also talk to ghosts?” Amanda asked. “Yes,” Jessie said, at the same time that Bobby said no. “How great that you have each other,” Amanda said. “Oh, dear. I’m sorry.” Jessie waved goodbye and backed away. The next time she ran into Bobby, Bobby had bear bells, two of them, one red and one blue. She gave the red one to Jessie. “We should be more careful,” she said. She’d also gotten herself a pair of sneakers. They were white and scuffed, certainly not new, possibly not her size, but better than the flip-flops. This time when they got to the boulder she stayed by Jessie’s side. “Do you mind?” she asked. Jessie shook her head. “Sorry about the coffee shop. I shouldn’t have said anything.” Bobby laughed. “Yeah, that was awkward. But no worries, we’ll figure it out. How’s Grace?” “Oh, fine. And your sister?” “We’re still going over some stuff. One good thing about talking to ghosts, though,” she said. “You can’t misread each other’s faces! Joy and I did that a lot.” “Sounds familiar,” Jessie’s mother said. “What about you and Grace?” Bobby asked. “Go ahead,” her mother said. “Tell her we argue all the time. Tell her you’re still trying to solve the mystery—answer the riddle, find the fleece, plant the magic beans, anything!—that will fix us.” “She’s been quieter lately,” Jessie said. At the end of the walk she and Bobby exchanged numbers and started planning to meet on Mount Archer instead of leaving it to fate. It’s a cliché that bad things happen in threes, and yet that fall Diana lost her son. Thomas collapsed at basketball practice, taken by a heart defect no one had known was there. A week after the funeral, Diana told Jessie that she wanted to come to Mount Archer. Just to try. Just because maybe. Just because she would do anything to hear his voice again. Jessie texted Bobby and Bobby was waiting in the parking lot when they arrived. The two had never met, but Bobby opened her sweatshirt arms and wrapped Diana in her flying-squirrel hug. They took the blue trail, Bobby in the lead, then Diana, Jessie bringing up the rear. There was an unusual number of red-winged blackbirds that day, their calls piercing the air. Jessie’s mother was quiet and, from the expression on Bobby’s face, it seemed Joy was, too. Near the summit, Jessie stopped. “Did you hear that?” “What?” said Diana. “Where?” “Is it the bear?” Bobby said. The three women reached for one another, not to make themselves bigger or smaller, not to stand their ground or retreat. But because it was instinct.

        "story": "In recollection it seems less memory than dream, how transformed the stricken city was. For years I’d been disheartened by its growing defacement: the brutal high-rises, the piled-up trash and hellish din, the garish advertising no matter where you looked. But now I couldn’t help feeling guilty about the pleasure I took in the lifeless streets. To be the only pedestrian for blocks, to have an acre of Central Park to yourself. (And oh, the red-tailed hawks, the bald eagle landing almost at your feet.) If in the past I’d often found myself wishing to be elsewhere, grateful for any reason that took me away from New York, once the pandemic began I had no wish to leave. I didn’t share the widespread resentment toward those who’d fled to their country homes, but I understood the fantasy that the many departed residents—along with the millions of missing tourists—would not return. Things a person with a cell phone might have been tempted to snap and share: Young lovers huddled on a stoop, passionately making out through their face masks. A standard black poodle wearing a matching leopard-print raincoat, booties, and mask. (Is there nothing dogs won’t put up with from us?) In the window of a shuttered florist’s, left over from Before: help wanted. must have a clue. Movie house marquee: see you on the other side. There is a foolproof cure for writer’s block, according to a teacher I know: start with the words I remember. It’s true that when I see those words—wherever they might appear—I want to read on. And one of my favorite books is I Remember by Joe Brainard. A question writers are sometimes asked: What’s a book you’ve read that you wish you’d written? The miracle of Brainard’s book is that you can write it. You simply do what he did: put down one memory after another as it comes to mind (arranging them all later however you might wish), always beginning with the phrase I remember. (Actually, Brainard wrote more than one memoir of this kind over the years, but in time they were collected into a single volume, usually referred to as a work of autobiographical non-fiction but by some as a work of poetry.) Miraculous: a book in which just about every sentence begins with “I” but whose author cannot be called a narcissist. Except if you share the popular view that all writers are narcissists and that those who write about themselves are so to an extreme degree. (I like this clarification by the narrator of a book by Stendhal: “It is not out of egotism that I say I, it is because there is no other way to tell things quickly.”) Brainard, who was also a visual artist, was born in 1942, and I Remember is largely about growing up queer in midcentury Tulsa, Oklahoma. Among the many things he remembers are: poodle skirts and Perry Como shirts, people dancing the swing, the chicken, and the bop, grade school classmates sending each other valentines, Davy Crockett hats, blue suede shoes, “bouffants” and “beehives,” roller skate keys, raccoon tails dangling from car antennas, milkmen, jeweled bottle openers, the Campbell’s soup kids, Dick and Jane and Sally and Spot, pedal pushers, and pillbox hats. From which it can be seen that I Remember is also an enduring piece of Americana. Also remembered: coming-of-age anxieties, wonders, pleasures, shames. Erotic yearnings and bewilderments. Questions. Why doesn’t God just end polio and wars? How can a baby come out of such a small hole? Do goats really eat tin cans? Some memories are so common that many other people will remember them, too. The day John F.Kennedy was shot. And lots of “firsts”: cigarette, erection, hand job, time getting drunk. For most readers I know, this is one of the joys of reading I Remember: a memoir of one person’s life that is also about a collective past. But I have also known some who’ve been irritated: I remember pillbox hats, too. So what? Imitations of Brainard are abundant, and “I remember” exercises have been used in writing classes for people of all ages as well as in various clinical settings, such as therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. © Jim Goldberg/Magnum. Courtesy the artist and MACK Georges Perec started writing sentences beginning Je me souviens as an exercise and, like Brainard, ended up with a book. It delighted him that anyone at all could do what he and Brainard had done—here was literature that you didn’t have to be a writer to create—and he requested that, at the end of his book, a few pages be left blank “for readers to write their own ‘I remembers’ which the reading of these ones will hopefully have inspired.” About a century and a half before Brainard’s memoir, an English poet named Thomas Hood wrote “I Remember, I Remember,” in which, as the feverish and despondent speaker looks back, he remembers, he remembers the house where he was born and several lovely images, such as a flower-filled garden, from what seems to have been an idyllic childhood. Hood’s piercingly nostalgic lyric inspired another English poet, Philip Larkin, to write his own “I Remember, I Remember,” in which the speaker finds himself stopped at a train station in Coventry, which happens to be where he was born, a place “where my childhood was unspent,” he quips: a void recalled in bleakly sardonic verses. I like Günter Grass’s definition of a writer as “a professional rememberer.” When I wanted to assign students an exercise based on Brainard’s book, I was concerned that some of them might feel inhibited: What I remember is none of your business. So I suggested that they make two sets, one in which they wrote down true reminiscences, another in which they made things up, and interleave them. It was always easy, though, to tell true from false. I could tell by the wording. And it was a revelation how many of the true ones were about abuse. “I remember how my mother would make her girlfriends laugh by pinching me till I started to cry.” Most often remembered: a grandparent dying, an absent father, parents divorcing. Conspicuously missing: academic accomplishments of any kind, first love. “I remember after I had my appendix out, I cried when I had to go home, because in the hospital everyone was nice to me.” Now and then an arresting detail, such as this, from a daughter of Eastern European immigrants: “I remember the loaf of white bread under the Christmas tree.” The inevitable—and invariably male—smart-ass: “I remember when I shot Mom between the eyes. She looked surprised, but she shouldn’t have been.” “I remember the time Kim Kardashian begged me for a date.” And once, that rare thing in student writing: a good joke. “I remember how hard my thirtieth birthday was for me. I was thirty-four at the time.” I remember how enthusiastic most of my students were about the assignment, and how it was the best work that many of them did all semester. I remember thinking, Wouldn’t it be great to have written something as useful as Joe Brainard’s book? (Like the feeling I had when I saw that someone whose work I greatly admired had published a book of her collected stories. To have your complete oeuvre all in one place—how I envied that. One thick handsome volume. A plain cover—no image, just the author’s name and the book’s title. Reminding me of the first French books I owned, those serious-looking paperbacks: Gallimard’s Collection Blanche, the white collection, so called for the books’ cream-colored covers—though it might just as well have been for the authors’ skin. Against the pale background, the titles standing out in red: L’Étranger, La Nausée. All your work fitting neatly into just one book—how elegant. How dignified. Not taking up too much space in the world. Not asking for too much attention. What writer wants to look back and think, I wrote too much? But it’s probably true of most. How often while reading the latest offering by some well-established novelist have I thought, It’s terrible what happens to writers. And, of course, in the time since the publication of that volume of stories by the person I was telling you about, she has already produced a book of new ones.) I remember the end of childhood. It was June. I had finished sixth grade, and it was the day of my graduation from elementary school. In September I’d be starting junior high. No more walking to school. I’d be taking the bus—not the yellow school bus I’d taken in kindergarten and first grade, but the city bus. I’d be commuting like any grown-up, but instead of paying the fare I’d have a pass. Cause for anxiety: What happened if you lost your pass and didn’t have any money? How would you get home? Then you’d just have to walk (my mother). And in fact it was only about a mile and a half, not too far a walk, even in a storm—as I learned that winter when a blizzard cut the school day short. And I’d be taking a language class—French—for the first time. I’d be taking instrumental music. I’d be taking art. The world was opening up to me. It was all a bit overwhelming. I remember the wistful feeling that sometimes came over me in the days leading up to graduation and lent the day itself such poignancy. The only school I’d ever known, that I’d attended all those years—as far back as I could recall—everything that had happened there, years of life and learning, work and play, and now I’d never see elementary school again! I remember an assignment from that first year of junior high: Write an essay describing an important day in your life. Explain the day’s importance to you then and how you feel about it now. It was a happy day, it was a sad day, it was a beginning, it was an end, it was a new world beckoning, it was an old world lost to time. It was me, obviously under the giddy spell of Dickens. Not all of us would be going to the same junior high. I knew I’d never see some of my classmates again. Or my teachers, or the principal, or the cafeteria ladies, or the janitor, a humble, kindly Sicilian immigrant whose love of children was so intense that it illumined her like an aureole. I remember how I popped awake that morning, hours before it was time to get up. Saw the sun rise for the first time in my life. Saw the pale light on the dress that my mother had made me—the prettiest dress I’d ever owned—now hanging on the back of the bedroom door: light-blue cotton voile, full skirt, cap sleeves, white midriff embroidered with flowers. To be worn with a new pair of white ankle socks and new white patent-leather Mary Janes. (A look that, only a year later, when I was twelve, would have been greeted with nothing but derision.) I remember how my excitement grew with each fitting. Standing on a chair, my mother talking through the pins she held in her mouth—somehow she could do that without dropping or swallowing them. Another image of her: evenings in a rocking chair, bent over her embroidery like a scene from a hundred years before. And really, it was from her, wasn’t it, that I took in, early on, how much of life is shaped by sadness for what’s left behind. Hers was the abiding nostalgia of the immigrant, of one who’d come of age in wartime and for whom leaving home had been experienced as a mortal injury. I remember sitting on a rock in the middle of a stream one hot summer day. Girl Scout camp. We had stopped to rest during a hike. I remember dipping a hand in the cold water and how it came to me—I don’t know whether it was something I’d heard before or something I’d arrived at just then on my own—that this was a way of describing time: a stream flowing swiftly along; it goes in one direction, it cannot be seized or stopped. And I remember finally getting why people (grown-ups) were forever pointing out how quickly time passed—which had until then seemed so plainly false to me (always happier at school than when stuck at home, I found summers endless)—and why my mother often said things like Sunday already! and I can’t believe it’s 1964! And this I connected with something else she said all the time, whenever we ran into someone we hadn’t seen in a while. No sooner was that person out of earshot than she’d say, My God, he (or she) got so old! On the rock that day, my hand started to ache from the cold water. But I left it there because of the feeling I had, of being on the brink of some Idea, not wanting to lose focus. Time passing was life passing, I thought. It was life that flowed swiftly along in one direction and could not be seized or stopped. And this was something that weighed on grown-ups, an inexorable force that they feared. My life, like everyone else’s, was passing, too—I got that. But I was still a child, I knew nothing of that fear. I knew only the excitement of my own mind turning over. I’m going to be a poet. I remember how much I wanted to share this startling revelation—to tell all about the very strange thing that had just happened to me sitting there on the rock in the stream—but with whom? Not the girls sunning themselves on other rocks or on the grassy banks, who, at someone’s suggestion, had just launched into “Go Tell It on the Mountain,” a favorite troop song. I knew that if I tried to explain to them what had happened I would only sound weird. It wasn’t a scout thing. It was a thing that belonged to Introvert Me. Scout Me was Extrovert Me. I knew the distinction, if not yet the words. Our leaders were forever hammering us about the need to look outside ourselves. Do a good turn daily was our slogan; our promise, To help people at all times. Self-reliance was encouraged, but not introspection (navel-gazing, ugh). Not self-expression. I pulled my numb hand from the water and joined in the song. I remember earning Girl Scout badges in first aid, horseback riding, weather watching, and camping. There was no such thing as a scribe badge, for writing, as there is now. Good God, there’s even a badge for novel writing: Purpose: When I’ve earned this badge, I’ll know what it takes to write a great novel and I’ll have written at least twenty pages of my own. Step 1: Deconstruct a novel. Step 2: Create great characters. Step 3: Develop a plot. Step 4: Write at least twenty pages. Step 5: Edit your pages. Easy peasy. I remember how we marched into the auditorium, just as we always did for assembly, single file through two separate doors, boys on the left, girls on the right, Mr. Quin playing “Pomp and Circumstance” on the piano. We had to line up according to height. Ahead of me was Emma, ahead of Emma was Diane, and first in line was a girl whose name I forget, along with what country she was from, though I can still see her so well. A tiny thing—stunted, it was said, from early-childhood illness or malnutrition. Tiny cross at her throat, tiny rings in her tiny pierced ears. In her pink organza dress with its giant bow at the back, a doll come to life. Half the size of those toward the end of the line. I remember the last girl of all—the distinction most likely an agony to her—as big as the last boy, as big as some of the mothers and fathers watching us from their seats in the auditorium. Here are the most recent statistics I could find for my elementary school, from the National Center for Education Statistics and the New York City Department of Education: Gender: 51percent male, 49percent female Minority enrollment: 96percent Overall New York State test ranking: 4,157 out of 4,228 schools Math test scores proficiency: 14percent Reading/language arts test scores proficiency: 14percent Eligible for free lunch: 93percent I didn’t become a poet after all. I remember, I remember. O beautiful refrain. I saw the notebook as soon as I entered the park. Someone had left it behind, on a bench, where its bright-red cover caught my eye: a medium-size leather-bound Moleskine (I happened to have one just like it). Surely not on purpose, I thought. Someone must have been sitting there, probably writing in the book, then had put it aside and forgotten about it. It was the kind of mistake people everywhere were reporting those days, mistakes owing to unusual absent-mindedness: a symptom of pandemic brain fog. (Twice so far I had forgotten to pull out my bank card at the ATM.) I looked around but saw no one except a Parks & Rec worker up ahead, collecting trash. I picked up the book and opened it to the flyleaf, where I knew I’d find details on how to return it—even a blank for the size of the reward. But no such information had been filled in. Just then she appeared, walking rapidly in my direction. She wore a coat that was the same scarlet as the notebook, and a felt beret that was also red, though a shade lighter. I could read her anxiety from where I stood; it was in her gait and, as she neared, in her expression. She must have realized she’d forgotten the notebook and rushed back to retrieve it; she must have worried that it would be gone. But when she saw me standing there, the notebook in my hand, she froze and, rather than happiness or gratitude or relief, the look on her face was one of dismay. Confused, but with what I hoped was a reassuring look of my own, I held the book out to her: Is this yours? She shook her head—once—avoiding my eyes before hurrying past, walking ever more quickly until she was almost jogging away. What had just happened? I was certain that the notebook belonged to her. Why wouldn’t she take it? She must have suspected that I’d opened it—and not just to the flyleaf. Say it was her private journal, a place for recording intimate thoughts, for baring heart and soul. That a stranger could have invaded this privacy, could have seen something that was never meant to be shared, was distressing to her. It was humiliating. She would rather lose the book for good than face that embarrassment. After all, she had chosen not to provide instructions “In case of loss...” Not knowing what else to do, I laid the notebook down where I’d found it. At once a squirrel hopped from the ground to sit squarely on it, like a storybook creature whose task was to guard it. But when he begged for food and I turned up empty palms, he took off. I told myself there was at least a chance that the woman would come back later to look for the notebook again. And after I’d taken my usual long walk, I circled back to see if it was where I’d left it. It was not. I tried to convince myself that it was now safely in its owner’s possession but, remembering the trash collector who’d been there before, I knew it had more likely landed in his cart. The whole episode had an exaggerated effect on me. Whenever it came to mind—as it did frequently—I felt a wave of regret. If only I had delayed my arrival in the park by five minutes! Rationally, of course, I knew I’d done nothing wrong. But it is possible—it is common, in fact—to feel guilty for something for which you were not at fault. With the exception of psychopaths, humans are made this way. There are those who’ve destroyed themselves because they were unable to prevent others from being destroyed. There is the phenomenon of survivor’s guilt. I kept seeing the woman as she hurried away from me, her head down, her shoulders hunched: that look of defeat. I thought about her matching coat and notebook and her almost-matching beret, and how red must have been her favorite color. Red is my favorite color. Returning home, she climbs the stairs to her apartment, where she lives alone. She climbs slowly, step by weary step. Inside she removes her hat but not her coat. The coat she unbuttons, and without taking it off she drops onto a chair at the kitchen table. She sits at the table in her winter coat and stares out the window. Her view is of other windows—there is an apartment building opposite—and because it is late many windows are lit, several of them showing television screens, some tuned to the same channel. The daily coronavirus press briefing. Dr. Birx. President Trump. She should turn on her own TV, she thinks—in a time of crisis, stay informed—but she makes no move to. She sits staring across the way as if hypnotized by the screens’ flicker-flicker, not bothering to remove her coat or get up to turn on a light. She sits in the gloaming and the silence—that silence broken only by the sirens that have become so familiar, that will always haunt the memories of those who were at the pandemic’s epicenter.

        "story": "I’m going to take a minute now to see if I can get my dates straight. Peter and I were married in June 1962. In early December, Peter told me we were going to Saigon. We left for the West Coast in February 1963, and arrived in Saigon right after Tet. I recall how disappointed I had been that morning to find I was not yet pregnant. Another month before I began to hope. A few more weeks, then, when I dared say a word to Peter. My first doctor’s appointment was in May, after my second missed period—a doctor at the Navy clinic most of the female dependents used. Peter ha d gotten his name. I was too superstitious to ask any of the women I knew for recommendations. Not yet. The doctor assured me we’d hit the mark. “The rabbit died,” is what we said in those days, although I don’t think any rabbits were actually involved. It was, the doctor pointed out, the year of the rabbit. A good omen, he said. And I recall Peter asking later, “How is a dead rabbit a good omen?” We had a laugh over that. Peter’s assignment was meant to be for nine months to a year, so chances were good I’d be home for the delivery, but Dr. Navy (cannot recall his name, no doubt I’ve suppressed it) said he was perfectly capable of delivering our child for us should our plans change. And, he added, nursemaids were so cheap over here, why go back to the States where you’ll have to do all the care and feeding yourself? And think of it, he added, all his life your baby will have an intriguing tale to tell about the exotic place where he was born. All his girlfriends will be checking their atlases. I had the sense that he’d said this to other women, that it was one of his standard, avuncular attempts at a charming bedside manner, but still the words gave me, for the first time, permission to exhale, to begin to imagine our child’s long life. Early June and I was dressing for another party. A reception at the American Embassy, then dinner with three other couples at My Canh, a floating restaurant on the river. A popular place for families. Maybe because it was a popular place for families, it was bombed by the Viet Cong only a few years later. There was a photograph, as I recall, not as well-known as the little girl fleeing the napalm, but the kind that sears your memory nevertheless: an impossibly bloodied child—impossible because her body was so small—in the arms of an American man—the eyes of both, man and child, blank, somehow, utterly expressionless. Shock, I suppose. You can only imagine what those eyes had seen. But that was some time later, as I said. We were still keeping the news of my pregnancy to ourselves, but I was sure knowing glances would be exchanged among the other women when I refused a cocktail. I recall I’d just had a new dress delivered from Maison Rouge. A silk floral with a full skirt. I was looking forward to wearing it, wondered how long before I outgrew the fitted waist. I was in the bathroom just off the master. It was a fairly large Western-style bathroom with a lovely soaking tub. I was in my slip, waiting until the last minute to put on my new dress. A sudden sense of vertigo, and then a small cramp. Nothing dramatic. No more than the bottoming-out sensation of an elevator dip, followed by a brief stab, like a runner’s stitch, in my center. Followed immediately by an utter sense of devastation: the collapse of something precious and irreplaceable, that gale of disbelief that follows the news of any loss, that follows the sudden, slipped-from-your-fingers loss of something invaluable. But that was brief as well. I shook it off, finished doing my makeup. Sprayed my hair. Used the toilet one more time and saw the spot of blood. It seems strange to say now, it even seemed strange to me at the time, but my first thought was that I did not want to be the sort of woman who had a miscarriage. Didn’t want to be a part of that simpering sorority, a keeper of that shameful secret (for so it was considered at the time), that failure. Until that moment, I was on the side of healthy, fertile women who gave birth easily to robust and beautiful children. Now, with the small circle of blood, I was on the side of the stumblers, the weak, those sick, troublesome, bedridden women in pin curls and satin bed jackets who gave their long-suffering husbands nothing but grief and disappointment. I wanted to put on the new dress, pretend this wasn’t happening, carry on regardless, but I had a vision of blood staining the seat of my skirt, soaking through the gorgeous silk while solicitous but subtly scornful women came to my aid with linen napkins sympathetically placed. When Peter called to me from downstairs to say we were really running late, I asked him to come up. His particular expression of husbandly indulgence and impatience—he was, I could tell, prepared to tell me I looked fine, any dress was as good as another, we’re late—fell away as soon as he saw me, now in my dressing gown, stretched out on our bed. “What’s wrong?” I said I’d had a wave of nausea. Said perhaps the morning sickness I had so far avoided had finally found me here in the late afternoon—maybe it was confused by the time zone. He took my hand. Said we’d cancel our plans. But I told him to go. Told him I only wanted to sleep and he’d be here all night with nothing to do. We’d already sent the cook and the yard boy home, as we usually did on the nights we dined out, and Minh-Linh, our housekeeper, would return to her quarters out back as soon as she’d prepared our bedroom for the night. I told Peter to ask her to stay, maybe she could bring up some tea once I’d had a snooze. I remember he was wearing a new suit—I’d gotten the name of the tailor from Helen Bickford, whose husband was always impeccably dressed. He was freshly shaven, I could smell his signature bay rum. Behind it, a touch of the gin and tonic he always had as he waited for me to get ready. He seemed so boyish sitting on the side of the bed like that, and I was so in love with him that I whispered, without thinking, “I’ve had a little blood.” And then wished I hadn’t. He flushed. “Is that bad?’ he asked. “Not really,” I said, with an authority I completely lacked. “It happens.” I saw him glance, surreptitiously, from my face to my breasts, hips, legs. And then he quickly looked back again, as if everything below my neck—that territory he had so expertly explored over these many months—had suddenly become alien to him, somewhat disconcerting. We came up with a compromise: he would go to the cocktail gathering, then come back to see how I was doing. We would decide then whether or not we would go out to dinner. I suppose I slept heavily for a while. When I woke—the cramps were now full-blown menstrual style—the lights in the room had been lowered, the air conditioner was humming, and a joss stick burned on the dresser. I went to the bathroom, more blood, but nothing copious, and when I crawled back into bed Minh-Linh appeared with a tray: a teapot, a delicate cup and saucer, a plate of rice crackers. I hadn’t known until that moment that she knew I was expecting. She was middle-aged, thin, with a quiet industriousness about her. She looked humorless on first encounter, but we’d quickly learned that she laughed easily. Peter claimed that she understood English very well and was also fluent in French, but I hadn’t had much occasion to speak with her at length. She’d been taking care of whoever occupied this house for years, and my impulse had always been to accede to what I thought must have been her well-established routine. She placed the tray on my bedside table and poured a cup. I sat up to take it from her. Then she went to the window to turn off the air conditioner, and then turned on the overhead fan. She knew this was how I preferred the room when I napped. She came back to the bed and asked, “Feeling better?” I only shrugged, too exhausted and worried to be perky. She patted her flat stomach. “Much pain?” she asked. I nodded. And then raised the teacup to my lips to keep from blubbering. But the tears came anyway. Gently, she took the cup from me. She ran a comforting hand over my hair, still stiff with going-out hair spray. I suppose it felt odd to her. She went into the bathroom and found my brush. Then she nodded that I should move over. She sat beside me and slowly brushed my hair until the hair spray was combed out and I’d cried all I could cry. And then she gently pulled my hair back over my ears and braided it neatly. When she was finished, she returned the cup to me. I drank the now tepid tea, ate a tasteless cracker. She fixed the pillows behind me and said, “Sleep, please.” As I slept again, I imagined that my sincere affection for Minh-Linh was surely purer, less condescending, less self-satisfied, less colonial, certainly, than that of the other female dependents for their housekeepers here in Saigon. Another kind of American hubris, I suppose.  Iwoke when Peter came in, my Navy doctor just behind him. They both had their jackets off. Peter wore a white short-sleeved dress shirt, his collar open and his tie unknotted. The doctor was in his military beige. They both filled the room with the smell of cigarette smoke and sweat. Peter said, cautiously, “How are you feeling, honey?” He stood at the foot of the bed. He seemed a little shy, maybe embarrassed, and I suddenly touched my hair—Minh-Linh’s French braid coming undone. Not a look he was accustomed to. I suppose it made me look weaker than I felt. I struggled to sit up. I knew I was bleeding heavily now. Dr. Navy moved into our bedroom with more authority than my husband had, tossing his jacket on the bed, coming toward me as if to make some small adjustment to my head and neck that would restore proper order. He felt my forehead. His hand was large and soft, the backs of his fingers covered with manly fur. I felt a rough callous or two. A golfer or tennis player, I thought. He wore a handsome wristwatch. “No fever,” he said, and then sat heavily on the side of the bed. “Any pain?” he asked. Reluctantly, I told him I was a little uncomfortable. Not much. “You can take some aspirin,” he said. “It won’t hurt the baby.” I knew he was drunk. I could see how he struggled to keep his eyes properly focused, and yet his words filled me with hope. If he believed the baby would not be harmed by an aspirin, then he believed the baby was still there, still headed for his birth in this exotic place. “There was some blood,” I whispered, and glanced at Peter, who glanced away. “It happens,” the doctor said. “My wife was always springing leaks when she was expecting—we’ve got five.” He showed me his palm, fingers spread and wiggling, as if to illustrate five plump children with hair on their backs. “Nothing unusual. You first-timers fret about everything.” He patted my thigh. “Get yourself some rest, little mother,” he said. “Take an aspirin if the pain gets bad.” He gestured toward Peter. “I’m going to take this man of yours out for a good meal. Things will look better in the morning.” Peter asked, “Do you want me to stay?” I waved him on. He’d probably had a few too many himself. “No, go,” I said. In truth, I wanted them both gone so I could get to the bathroom and see the extent of the blood. I wanted to take that little bit of assurance this drunken doctor had given me and hold it up against the fact of whatever it was my body was determined to do. They lingered a bit longer. Discussed bringing something back for me to eat, some soup or some pho. Peter told me he had already asked Minh-Linh to stay close. She’d spend the night in the second bedroom. She’d offered to cook some eggs. I said, perhaps impatiently, that I was fine. Rest was what I needed. “Absolutely,” the Navy doctor said. “R and R. The best medicine.” As they left the room, my husband asked the good doctor, “Is that a Rolex?” I waited until I heard them go out through the gate, until I heard the car—it might have been waiting—take them away. In the bathroom, I saw the blood was copious. And then I saw, in the midst of it, the small sac of the embryo. I reached into the toilet, into the water and the blood, and scooped the tiny thing out. Held it in my cupped hands. It was so small, but still I recognized the pale seahorse shape from college biology textbooks. The curve of it, the dark indication of an eye. I slid it from my palm to a folded towel on the side of the sink, washed the blood from my hands, changed into another nightgown, and went back to bed. So now I was a woman who had had a miscarriage. So now we would begin again, the monthly hope and disappointment, now with a little more caution, a little more fear. Now the easy, fertile future—my part in our successful life together—was no longer so easy. Or so assuredly mine. I heard from downstairs the buzzer at our gate. Heard Minh-Linh go out. Heard her voice as she returned, intertwined with—I felt another elevator drop—Charlene’s. I heard Charlene come up the stairs. She wore a sleeveless cocktail dress of deep-green shantung, with a slim skirt, a V-neck in front, and a raised collar in the back, regal. Her hair was up in a French twist, her diamond earrings sparkled. Her hazel eyes appeared green. She really was, in that dim light, remarkably attractive. Some cross between Grace Kelly and Maleficent. I was braced for her reflexive sneeze of a laugh, but all she said as she came into the dim room was “kiddo.” It was neither maternal nor condescending. It was—for lack of a better word—businesslike, efficient, authoritative even. Queenly. “What’s going on?” I told her, without weeping, that I had miscarried. That I’d been almost three months along. She said, “Shit.” In those days, I was not—I dare say most of us were not—accustomed to hearing women like Charlene curse like that. It startled me, but also made me want to laugh. She frowned. “You’re sure?” I nodded toward the bathroom and she went right in—she was wearing strappy black heels—businesslike, as I said. When she returned, she had the towel that held the embryo folded in her hands. She sat beside me on the bed. I sat up, leaned forward. With hardly a thought, hardly a doubt, I put my cheek to her tanned and freckled arm, which was surprisingly cool. There was the metallic tang of perspiration just beneath her lovely perfume. Charlene placed the towel on her lap, over the gorgeous green silk, and unwrapped the little thing, barely distinguishable now against the blood-soaked cloth. We looked at it together, silently, for what seemed a long while. I was aware of the click of the fan above our heads, the encroaching heat, some distant sound of traffic and voices in the street, Charlene’s flesh against my own. The joss stick had nearly burned down, but the scent of it was still in the air. And I suppose it was this scent that made me aware of both how far from home I was, how strange this place was, and yet how confined and familiar everything now felt, as if, with my own small failure, my own small grief, the world had shrunk, distance had lost its meaning. Nothing was foreign. No one was a stranger. I mean, here was Charlene, beside me in my own bedroom, my cheek to her bare arm. Gently, she placed the towel in my hands. She reached for the half bottle of Vichy water on my bedside table and poured a drop into her palm. She wet the fingertips of her right hand and made the sign of the cross over the tiny thing. Softly, she said, “I baptize thee, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Then she bent her head and whispered an Our Father. I joined her, pausing awkwardly as she spoke the final, Protestants-only (as I thought of it) phrase, “For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, forever and ever.” They seemed very grand words for such a small gathering of cells. She took the towel from me, folded it over again. “What should I do?” I asked her, not wanting to say, “What should I do with it?” But I knew she knew this was what I meant. Charlene said, “Let’s think for a minute.” She carried the towel back into the bathroom, rested it again on the edge of the sink. When she returned, she emptied the bottle of water into a glass. Then went to her purse and found a small prescription box. She slid it open and shook out a pill, which she handed to me, with the water. “You might as well,” she said when I hesitated. I swallowed the Librium and some water. She seemed satisfied. Took the glass from me and then bent down to whisper in my ear. “I hate this,” she said, hissing the words. “I just hate it.” There was a small bamboo chair in the corner of the room, and she carried it one-handed over to the side of the bed. She sat down, kicked off her heels, rubbed her stockinged toes. Casually, casually gossiping, she mentioned who had been at the party that night. The usual suspects, she said. I think it was at this time that the American ambassador was off to the Aegean on a family vacation and the deputy chief of mission was acting ambassador. Charlene couldn’t say his name, Trueheart, without some venomous irony coloring her voice. “Like something out of Ivanhoe,” she said. The gossip in those days was about a new ambassador—there was an American delegation in town, perhaps related to this. I remember Charlene telling me that they couldn’t stop perspiring. What else did she say during that long night? I recall how she leaned across her lap and spoke in the tone you might use (I myself had used it) to distract a small child from a chicken pox itch, a scraped knee, a fever. She’d caught a glimpse of Madame Nhu somewhere: beautiful, tiny. Maybe a bit heavy-handed with the eyebrow pencil. “The Dragon Lady,” I said, to show I was grateful for her efforts to distract. Charlene gave me her cool, assessing green eyes. “Don’t fall for it,” she said. “She’s a woman with spunk. Which is why men want to hate her.” She went on: a higher-up at one of the U.S.agencies—USIS, USOM, I can’t recall—had been at the party with his unhappy wife. Apparently, he’d been off in the countryside for six weeks, something to do with the rural hamlet program, and the wife had been left alone in Saigon. Charlene insisted I’d met the woman somewhere—she’d introduced us, she was certain. “She’s a clotheshorse,” Charlene offered. “Tonight she was wearing Guy Laroche, two pieces, coral-pink. Would have been lovely if it fit her right.” She shook her head—what to do with these women? “Girl spends a fortune on clothes,” Charlene said. “But not successfully. It’s all higgledy-piggledy. She doesn’t want the clothes. She just wants her husband to pay for them.” At one point during the party, Charlene said, this woman’s husband took her elbow to turn her toward an introduction, and “the poor girl” pulled away from him as if she’d been scorched. He cursed her under his breath. Everyone heard it. Everyone saw it. Awkward for all. And Helen Bickford had a tale to share. Charlene leaned over her skirt. “This is just between us.” Apparently, Charlene said, Helen had a friend back home, who had a friend at the Pentagon, who was the friend of a woman there who projected the draft call numbers for the Joint Chiefs. Five years out. “It’s quite complex,” Charlene said. “She takes all kinds of things into consideration. Retirements, reenlistments, men who’ll be drafted and then rejected, all overseas deployments, of course. And she needs to project five years out. Across all the services. She needs to be extremely accurate. It’s quite a job.” I tried to attend. I know I asked, “A woman does this?” But as she spoke I was listening, too, for Peter’s return, hoping this time he would not bring the doctor with him. I was considering whether I should show him the little embryo. I decided no, I should not. I was thinking of how naïve we had been, he and I, over these many months, believing that all our fun, our passion and delight, would lead only—joy upon joy—to a healthy child in our arms, our own. Charlene was saying that Helen Bickford told her tonight that last month this woman at the Pentagon was asked to go back and recalculate her projections for next year, 1964. This never happens, Helen said. These are careful numbers, carefully calculated five years out, there’s never a need to reassess. Pretty clear the order had to have come from the White House. This friend told Helen Bickford that this woman at the Pentagon was ordered to recalculate next year’s draft projections based on a full withdrawal from Vietnam. Everyone. All the brass, all the GIs, pilots, MPs—all. All out of here by the end of next year. “Picking up our marbles and going home,” Charlene said. “Not just the troop reduction JFK’s been talking about. Total withdrawal.” I moved uncomfortably in the bed; a cramp was cresting. “What about the communists?” I asked, hoping to prove I was listening. Charlene stood, walked around the room until she found an ashtray. She took a cigarette from her purse. “What about the peasants?” she asked, lighting it. And then, with a laugh, “What about Brown & Root? What about Esso? What about the porcelain-faced Madame Nhu?” She came back to the chair, shrugged, went on talking. She said she’d looked for me at the reception. Found Peter, who told her I was under the weather. And then, of course, she saw him leave with Dr.Navy. “Don’t go back to that guy,” she said. “Next time around. The last thing you want is a Navy doctor. They hardly know what they’re looking at. They get your feet in those stirrups and their ears between your knees and suddenly it’s all Up Periscope. They spend the rest of the exam trying to figure out what’s port and what’s starboard. Wondering where the hell the penis is.” I smiled. Still shocked, but growing less so, by Charlene’s language. “I went to a Frenchman for little Roger. He’s had a practice here for years. All the elites see him. He came right to the house for the delivery. Kent wanted me to go to Hong Kong, but I wouldn’t hear of it. Leave the twins alone here?” She brushed the suggestion away with a wave of her cigarette. “Go to my guy. He’s getting on in years, but he has a deep and abiding love for women. It’s delightful. I’m thinking of getting pregnant again just to see his brown eyes above my belly. You’ll swoon.” When Minh-Linh came in with her tray, more tea for us both, she asked me if I would like some eggs, and Charlene replied, “Good God, no.” Which was my sentiment exactly. I was happy to let her speak for me. Minh-Linh poured the tea and handed us each a cup. I saw her glance into the bathroom; she seemed about to go in to tidy up when Charlene said something to her in quick French. Minh-Linh paused, then glanced at me. Then nodded. She said, softly, “I understand.” She went out with her tray but returned later with another joss stick and what looked to me at first like a small gray stone. She lit the stick and placed it in the little sand-filled pail where we burned our incense. And then she placed the stone before it. It was in fact a small, smiling Buddha. Sharp-eyed Charlene, smarter than everyone, said, “Jizo?” And Minh-Linh shook her head. “Dizang,” she whispered. Charlene nodded. “Very sweet,” she said. “Thank you.” When Minh-Linh left again, Charlene looked at me and frowned. She did not like to be corrected. “Same difference,” she said. “It’s Jizo in Japan. Dizang here. A bodhisattva. Protector of travelers, but also of stillborn or miscarried children. Very sweet of her.” She told me then that she and Kent were in Tokyo when she miscarried after the twins. A Japanese friend had given her a similar little statue. She was five months along. “I’m sorry,” I said, but Charlene shrugged and sipped her tea. “Poor little thing was a mess,” she said. “Hadn’t developed right at all. She looked like a glove turned inside out. A little monstrous.” She tossed off a small laugh. “Although I guess that’s true of us all. Inside out, we’re all monsters.” I was strangely comforted by this news. I had not yet taken into consideration that there had been an imperfection in Charlene’s life. “Apparently, Jizo, or Dizang,” she was saying, “watches out for the little souls that have not lived long enough to accumulate good deeds. Who can’t cross over into the spirit world—permanently neither here nor there. Left only to pile stones endlessly on the edge of the riverbank. Just this side of the River Styx, I guess you could say. What you Catholics call limbo. Not exactly purgatory because there’s no hope for change.” “How sad,” I said. Charlene squinted at me through the smoke. “It gets worse. It’s a limbo without mercy. Apparently, there are demons in this place, this place on the riverbank. I guess so the little ones don’t get deluded into thinking they’re in heaven. The demons torment these lost souls, scatter their piled stones. Jizo, Dizang, protects them, hides them under his robes. A hint of benevolence in a place of eternal stasis.” She paused, picked some tobacco from her tongue. “Or some such,” she added. “As I understand it, Jizo is a bodhisattva rather than a Buddha because he’s elected to serve the underworld before reaching enlightenment himself. A kind of martyr, I guess. Assigned to the saddest and most futile of projects. Doing whatever good he can for these hopeless ones. What inconsequential good.” I saw her rub her thumb and ring finger together under her cigarette. A sign, I was beginning to learn, of her own quick thoughts. “Or something like that,” she went on, suddenly dismissive. “Buddhism is charming but I can’t say I truly get it.” “Minh-Linh’s a Catholic,” I told her. Charlene shook her head. “So’s Madame Nhu. But she was a Buddhist first.” She squinted again. “Or maybe Minh-Linh finds it politically expedient these days to call herself a Catholic. With all that’s going on.” I knew this was possible, but still I said, “I’ve seen her at Mass.” Charlene laughed her laugh. “Well then, you’ve been given your first little Buddha by a Roman Catholic.” And then she added, softening, “But that’s Vietnam. A mishmash.” She stood, plucked the little figure from the dresser, and examined it carefully. Then she padded over in her stockinged feet and handed it to me. It was plump and sweet-faced, of course, smiling, eyes closed. The outlines of small children were carved shallowly into the stone hem of his robe. There was something comforting about the way this happy little bit of cool rock fit into my palm. I hefted it and felt another wave of tears. Charlene reached for her purse again, induced me to take another Librium with my tea. She took a few as well. Knocking them back with the dregs of hers. At some point that night, our conversation led us to Charlene’s night terrors. They’d plagued her since the twins were born. Not nightmares, exactly, because she knew when they were happening that they weren’t dreams, and, moreover, she knew she was not asleep. And yet, she said, whenever she tried to explain them—to her husband, to the doctors he’d sent her to—she always reached first for some description of darkness. These terrors were, she said, infused with a terrible sense of waking darkness. Something like what the newly blind must feel. Or the newly buried. Impenetrable darkness with its attendant disorientation, missteps, clutches at the air. And yet there was also this tremendous certainty on her part that something truly worthy of her fear, something as solid as it was horrific, was there, in this darkness. Something terrible within it, or maybe just beyond it. It was not sleep, not dream, not nightmare, and she always felt afterward that if she had just managed to pursue it, terrified but resolved, she would have discovered a glitch in that dark veil, a tear in it. She would have glimpsed... she couldn’t say what. “It sounds awful,” I told her. We were both speaking drowsily by now. The hour, I suppose, or the Librium. “Yes,” Charlene said. “Absolutely awful.” She was on the little chair beside my bed, one leg pulled up under the lovely green silk of her skirt, the other swinging childishly. She said she only sometimes cried out during these episodes. Mostly, she sat up suddenly in bed, or—and this disturbed poor Kent even more—quietly rose, eyes wide open but utterly without sight—and stood stiffly in the dark, or sometimes with a hand held out before her, barely breathing, although when he touched her, he said, he could feel her pulse racing in every part of her body. And when she woke, her heart, too, would be racing. She would have to struggle to catch her breath. Like a third-rate actress in a two-bit horror movie, she said. “Our doctor at home prescribed the Librium. Recommended a psychiatrist. Anxiety, he says, something to do with childbirth. Although I suspect he told Kent I’m completely batty.” She paused. “I know it sounds ridiculous. No one likes waking up soaked in sweat. But I’m not sure I want to be rid of them. They’re telling me something. About myself, I suppose. Who I am. They’re telling me what my little old mind is capable of.” And then she laughed. “I’m not a fool,” she added, suddenly sober. “And I won’t be patronized.” She paused, looked into the air, but this time I knew her impatient, green-eyed appraisal was not directed at me. “I mean to see what I’m meant to see.” “Like what?” I asked her. She ran her eyes over the four walls of our bedroom. There was a bright gecko in the shadowed far corner of the ceiling that suddenly scrambled away, as if her gaze pursued it. “Demons,” she said. “Demons who want to topple the little stones I’m piling up here.” “In Vietnam?” I asked. Her cool gaze fell on me again. “In limbo,” she said. Later, well before Peter came home from dinner—he was very drunk—we did something, Charlene and Minh-Linh and I, something I’ve never told anyone about. We took that bloody little embryo and slipped it into the emptied prescription box. Charlene cleared a space in the pail of sand on the dresser and placed the box there. We added a few tissues and some broken-up pieces of another joss stick. We said another prayer. I said a Hail Mary in English while Minh-Linh said the same in Vietnamese. (I recall glancing at Charlene, as if to say, See? She’s a Catholic.) Charlene knew the prayer, but only in French. Together, we lit the tiny pyre and watched it burn. The smell of sandalwood overtook the room, and the brief flare of the flame caught the sweet stone face of Dizang, protector of my little sufferer, companion of my brief and ill-formed hope of a child.

        "story": "The atelier was located in what had once been a small castle. Over centuries, the outer walls had fallen and the main hall had softened into a stone residence flanked by two low barns and bordered by narrow, grassy moats, dug long ago to keep a handful of people safe against marauders seeking—what?, Jacob Jiang wondered on the day of his arrival. It was a drab afternoon in early April 2007. The high fields on either side of the road were splintered with old stalks and stems, the reddish soil lay pale in the severe light. Who would want this place? What treasure had been sought? Jacob approached the complex carrying his easel and a heavy suitcase. A man peered out from beneath an archway of withered vines. Jacob knew from photographs the goblin face, the aureole of whitening hair. Thomas Gaugnot’s hand was dry and thin, his handshake brief. He led Jacob across a courtyard and into the front room of the stone residence, where the painters lived. It was a cramped, dark room that smelled of burnt chestnuts. The massive fireplace was blackened to the ceiling, as if time itself had once turned there on an enormous spit. “You have traveled a long way,” Gaugnot said, gesturing toward a chair. “The reason, you say, is to learn from me.” Jacob struggled to unravel the man’s thick accent. “You say, to learn to paint in what you call ‘a naturalistic style,’?” Gaugnot continued. “For this, you left New York. And yet I sense that you have, what do they say, a hidden motive, another reason for coming to my atelier.” Jacob shifted in the too-small wooden chair. He felt within himself a clear, sustaining pilot flame of dislike. Gaugnot must be accustomed to receiving Americans of Jacob’s age—youngish but no longer young, casting away scraped-up savings to escape from a first set of bad choices. He forced himself to meet the unanticipated clarity of Gaugnot’s blue eyes. “What do you mean?” “They say my technique is obsolete,” Gaugnot said. “That is true. It is secret. It became a secret because no one cared. The attention of the world turned away from this kind of painting, what you call naturalism. You—” His gaze pushed Jacob back; the chair creaked. “You are here to learn the techniques of this secret.” He smiled a small, triumphant smile. “You think it is romantic.” Three of the front barn’s walls were built of stone. High along the north wall, a rectangular window let a muted but entirely consistent light fall over the dozen students at their easels. Jacob let his pupils adjust, feeling soothed and stimulated by this light. He set up his easel in the only empty space. It was, of course, in a spot he did not like, at the least favorable angle to the seated model. He searched his pockets for a dime to tighten a screw that had undone itself with travel—no European coins were thin enough—and set up his paints slowly, taking pleasure in the moment of anticipation. At last, holding a pencil, he turned to examine the model. Even in the sunless room, her hair came alive. It was a dark mass of waves and curlicues, untethered to gravity. In shape and in value, impossible to paint. He resented Gaugnot for presenting the challenge. He heard suddenly, as if from a warped nursery record on an old turntable, the crabbed voice of the wizened dwarf: If you can spin this straw into gold, I will let you have your child. Looking below the dark cloud of hair, he found the lovely face, as delicate and as gentle as the medieval Italian master’s sepia sketch. The downcast gaze arrested at a point on the floor before his easel. The mouth tender and resigned, lips closed, but only just. Below the face, the body, flagrant in its sensual appeal. It was supple, brown, naked. Again, in its own way, impossible to paint; and yet it would be least discouraging to start with the body. Jacob raised his pencil. His mother had taught him to draw in early childhood, without realizing how he would be gripped by the practice. He had picked up her habit of working quickly, making rapid impressions, usually good ones; but there was something in this space, in the seriousness of the other students, that seemed to demand a different approach. He looked more closely. The hip swelled out in a tulip curve, closing in at the bent knee as cleanly as a tulip bud; but it was difficult to put to paper. Perhaps it was the north light that made her line so perfectly smooth. His pencil wavered. Just one stroke, one curve. Slowly. But the line was too hard. He erased it, leaving a mark, and glanced back at the model. Nothing had changed; her eyes remained on the floor, allowing him to look. He stood, his pencil at his side, looking. The room grew warmer. Doves cooed and fluttered under the eaves. The creaking door opened and closed as students left to use the bathroom or to smoke, then returned to their easels. Gradually, Jacob became aware of Thomas Gaugnot behind him. Gaugnot’s breath smelled of sour coffee and an almost imperceptible decay. Jacob imagined the breath away, but Gaugnot did not leave. Now he hovered at Jacob’s shoulder—in his peripheral vision, Jacob could just glimpse a tuft of white hair. He began to sweat. Presumably, Gaugnot was sensing, in the remnants of his erased line, the truth: that Jacob was a talented draftsman who had never tried particularly hard, that he did not actually know how to draw. He heard a rustle as if a wind had passed through the room. The others put down their charcoal and their brushes. It was time for a break. But he could not stop looking at the model. It was a numb stare of failure; and yet there was something he felt he might see if he tried hard enough. He did not turn away from the model and the model did not move. It was as if she knew he needed her to stay where she was. Then Gaugnot stood next to her, touching the small of her back. “Hannah,” he said, and Jacob understood. Gaugnot draped a white robe over her shoulders. Together he and Hannah walked to the corner, where most of the other students were already pouring hot water into cups. Only Beth, Jacob’s neighbor, remained behind, straightening her brushes. She was a shy woman with sandy hair cut short, exposing her small ears. “She likes you.” There was a beat before he realized that Beth had spoken, for she had put into words a thought that had been in the back of his own mind. “I’m behind. She waited because she can see that I’m new and I’m behind.” He was behind; he had been summoned as an alternate. Almost everyone had finished their first figure drawings, and they were now going over the charcoal with turpentine and brush. This slow technique had fallen out of favor a hundred and fifty years ago, as fashion turned to the more free-flowing process of impressionism. Somehow the practice had survived, passed on from painter to pupil. Still Jacob could not resist adding, “How would you know?” Beth kept her gaze trained on the model’s empty chair. “I know.” “Hope you’re right.” He caught her eye, risked a crooked grin. “If I were you,” she said, “I wouldn’t even think about Hannah, unless I were drawing or painting her.”  On Jacob’s second full day, Gaugnot brought the class on a walk “to see the light.” It was a clear, warm day: the sun had regained dominion over the countryside after a long winter. They came to an old stone windmill whose blades had been removed, a mute and flightless monolith. At its base, a wooden door opened into a chill, black space smelling of mildew. They followed the watery orb of Gaugnot’s flashlight up a flight of circular stairs: once around, twice around, the orb bobbed faintly on the rough inner wall. At last, they heard the scrape of a latch, the creak of heavy shutters. A narrow, brilliant shaft of sunlight pierced the darkness. “Come here. Your turn. Stand at the window.” Gaugnot spoke to the student closest to him. There was a long silence. Jacob heard a few muttered words. Then, feeling his way, the student stepped carefully back down the stairs, past Jacob, out the door. “Come here,” Gaugnot said to someone else. “Your turn.” One by one, they took turns at the window. Jacob could hear Gaugnot speaking what sounded like the same words to each. Impatiently, he wondered at the purpose of this field trip. At last, Gaugnot said to him, “Come here.” Jacob stepped up to the window, eyes shut against the dazzling sun. “Open your eyes,” Gaugnot said, over his shoulder. “So you could see this light, I brought you here.” Stubbornly, Jacob looked away, waited for his pupils to adjust, then at last returned his gaze out the window. From a glowing field of wheat, a flock of blackbirds rose into the lucent sky. But they were strange blackbirds with white patches on their wings. Silent and disorienting in a sunny ditch stood something like a great blue heron, only smaller. From further up the road there came the sound of buzzing insects. He bent his head out of the narrow window to look more closely. The vibrations came from what appeared to be a pile of melting leaves in the middle of the road. It was the carcass of a small animal of some kind. Jacob held his gaze as the carcass swayed and moved, flapping with what looked like red-black butterflies. The vivid colors and shapes appeared familiar, but entirely strange under the light. It was as if he had traveled into another point in history. “Well, Jacob,” said a dry voice at his shoulder. “What do you see?” He wondered if the question were a kind of test. He struggled for an answer. “What do you see?” He swallowed. “It’s—mysterious.” Gaugnot said nothing. He had offered the wrong answer. After waiting for a long moment, the teacher spoke, scornfully. “Perhaps you have not really looked at it before.” He turned away and said to someone else, “Come here. Your turn.” The interior of the windmill was impenetrably black as Jacob stumbled, stung, back down the stairs. That same light filtered through the barn’s high north window in a perfect, luminous blue rectangle, casting its radiance, though more dimly, upon the few objects that appeared in everybody’s still-life sketches: a bird’s nest, a cracked white pitcher, a loaf of bread. On Jacob’s third morning at the atelier, he woke early, determined to make a private search of the second barn. He wanted an original object for his own composition. As he passed by the studio, he saw a few of the others already there, talking. He entered and pretended to set up his materials, straining to listen, to comprehend the knowledge of Gaugnot, the master who had studied with Rennes, and, through him, Renoir, and, through him, all the way back to Leonardo. They were discussing Gaugnot’s instructions for the color wash—the next, exacting stage of the figure painting after the turpentine brushwork. “Turpentine and pigment,” said George Carney, the class monitor. “It’ll take weeks,” objected Lloyd, who worked in front of Jacob. “He says,” Carney spoke with reverence, “that pre-painting is a required step.” Lloyd fell silent. At five minutes to nine, Gaugnot and Hannah drove into the courtyard in a little green Citroën. Nobody spoke as Gaugnot approached the barn, Hannah behind him. Carney jumped up and opened the door. Gaugnot entered, drawing the gaze of the entire class. Only Beth nodded at Hannah. “Good morning.” Hannah smiled. “Good morning.” Jacob also watched Hannah, although the others ignored her as she undressed and took her seat. Instead, they gathered around Gaugnot, their eyes fixed upon the small man with the goblin face who began to talk about “pathways.” Jacob struggled to understand. Gaugnot’s accent seemed especially strong today. After a time, Jacob made out that there were visible pathways in the surface of the body. You could trace them, Gaugnot said. He pointed to Hannah’s arm. “Here, and here.” Jacob squinted but saw only the dark luminosity of Hannah’s perfect skin. Gaugnot spoke of “structures” that one could see along the pathways. All things appeared mysterious, but the human body was comprehensible, its mysteries visible, through the existence of pathways, structures. No one argued, no one even asked questions. Jacob leaned toward Beth. “You getting this?” She held a finger to her lips. At morning break, Lloyd offered Gaugnot a cup of hot water, but the master painter shook his head. He let Hannah make his tea, let her slice a wedge of lemon that smelled faintly of roses. The others turned away, envious. Jacob left the studio and made his way across the yard, to the back barn. He was determined to impress Gaugnot by finding a special object for his still life. Surely Gaugnot would see and appreciate the effort; must he not be longing to look at something new? But the back barn was filled with ancient and unpaintable things: enormous metal hooks with handles; knotted horsetails made of odds and ends of twine; a blacksmith’s anvil; oozing cans marked faites attention; sticks, snowshoes, harnesses; large rocks; rusted metal in innumerable scalloped and pierced and spoked and notched shapes; and, in the center of it all, a perfectly polished, red, pre–World WarII John Deere tractor. Jacob left the barn, discouraged. It would be better to find something simple. Two months passed. No one moved quickly—not even those who’d been at the atelier for years—but in this group of perfectionists, Jacob became the standout of slowness. When he had set himself the goal of learning Gaugnot’s method in half a year, he had not expected the method to be so complex, so filled with elaborate and possibly superfluous stages. In the daytime, he worked through lunch at his easel. At night, when it was impossible to work, he lay in his cramped French bed under a matted, scratchy blanket, his feet against the solid wooden baseboard, and he questioned himself. It was a hair shirt of a bed, and yet he kept under the covers because there were no window screens. The pressing darkness quivered with the whine of mosquitoes. Everyone ignored the insects; a local farmer’s wife might spend hours creating an elaborate, glazed tart and serve it en plein air, crawling with flies. He could not separate his frustration with the atelier from his frustration with the French countryside itself, and with Gaugnot—himself so very French—pointlessly exacting in some ways, yet theatrically oblivious in others: Gaugnot, whose little smile verged on smugness as he pointed at the beguiling curve of Hannah’s breast; Gaugnot who one afternoon, when he became annoyed, spat—accidentally or no—on a student’s canvas. Was this the classical education he had imagined? He had been deluded; he was a romantic. Sweating under his blanket, Jacob pushed away the thought that the position of his easel was unlucky, even cursed. Its former occupant, Bart Weiss, had quit the class, banished, perhaps, by Gaugnot, or defeated by the dreary, idle country winter. Perhaps it was the ghost of Bart that made his hand shake, his turpentine spill, a stray barn swallow mark his canvas. He could ask Beth what had become of Bart, or he could ask Carney. But Carney rarely gossiped, rarely noticed anyone save during the daily positioning of Hannah, whose limbs he treated as if they were red-hot pokers and he were wearing oven mitts. It would have to be Beth. She typically took an extra ten minutes after class to clean her brushes and meticulously rearrange her easel, so one morning Jacob stayed behind and asked her to lunch. She put on her floppy hat, and they set off on the brief walk to the village restaurant. As they passed the moats, he asked about Bart Weiss. Beth didn’t answer for a minute. “What I mean is,” he persisted, “am I laboring under a cloud or something? Is my spot cursed?” “You’re doing well,” she said. “To be frank, you seemed a bit at sea those first couple of weeks, but I’ve begun to notice a change. You really seem to have—” He waited hopefully for her to explain the change. But she returned to the subject of Bart Weiss. “He was here longer than any of us. Seven years.” She frowned, clearly deciding how much to tell him. “Then Thomas told him he had to go.” “Kicked him out of the atelier?” “I suppose so.” Jacob made a guess. “He slept with Hannah?” Beth winced, but when she spoke, her voice was calm. “Thomas said that Bart had stopped learning.” They approached the small restaurant in the center of the village. Jacob had already visited the place to view its collection of still lifes by former students. The painters, it was said, had revitalized the area. Certainly they had bought property; they frequented the restaurant; they drank the local wine. They purchased used cars and bicycles and microwave ovens and fans; they bought toilet paper and bottles of vegetable oil and bars of soap and left all of it barely used or half-finished with the locals, who kept things faithfully unused, or resold them, or finished them and recycled the containers. All of this activity, this consumption, the provenance of Thomas Gaugnot. Even outside the studio, Gaugnot was a force; he had created a local economy based almost solely on the idea that it was possible to give up one’s concerns, move to rural France, and dedicate one’s life to recovering the great age of painting. It was a cult, Jacob decided—and, as in a cult, the students abandoned their former lives, they tried not to trouble themselves with material concerns, they put all of their energy into following their leader. Jacob did not share these observations with Beth; from what he could tell, she was one of the cult’s most devoted members. Now she switched easily to French, explaining to the proprietor that they wanted a table inside. She took every opportunity, Jacob noticed, to avoid bright light of any kind. Her easel was far from the window. Her old sun hat was lined with black under the brim. After they were seated and both had ordered the lunch special, she went on quietly, in English: “Thomas told Bart that in the development of every artist, there’s a turning point. A moment after which it becomes clear he has reached the end of his talent. He’s done as well as he can. And in the aftermath of this moment, every new work he does—everything he sees—becomes derivative of the work he was doing then.” “And I suppose Thomas can see this moment as it’s happening?” Jacob could not control the sarcasm in his voice. “Nobody can. Most often, the painter doesn’t know himself. And generally it comes after he’s made progress, done some of his best work. It can take years to see. But Thomas can usually see it before others can. Last summer, Bart painted a still life of red poppies. They’re not blooming yet; you’ll see them soon. But if you pick them right when they bloom, they last three days. Bart managed somehow to paint them in that time. Oh.” With a childlike movement, Beth set her fingertips against her cheek. “It was a glorious painting. What I wouldn’t give to have the ability to capture the poppies in three days. Although I hope I don’t stop there... Anyway, it became clear—clear to Thomas—that Bart would not continue past the poppies, so in the fall, when he posted the next year’s class—” “Where do you want to stop?” Jacob asked, speaking to ward off the ever-present fear and resentment of Gaugnot that had ambushed him as she spoke. “After you learn to paint the poppies—?” Suddenly he knew. “It’s Hannah, isn’t it?” A shadow of caution fell over the table. “What do you mean?” “Forget the still lifes. Secretly, everyone in class, everyone just wants to make a decent painting of Hannah.” When Beth spoke, her voice was prim. “Hannah is with Thomas. She’s his muse.” Even in this group—whose lack of irony flavored each conversation with unintentional nostalgia, who tossed around the word “beautiful” as if beauty was still of vital concern to visual art—he would not have believed it possible that any flesh-and-blood woman could be thought of as a muse, not without a snicker. And even more unsavory to imagine Hannah as Gaugnot’s muse, from Gaugnot’s private Tahiti. Not for the first time, Jacob felt the knock of his own desire. The server stood above them, waiting for their attention. She placed before each of them an avocado half, pitted masterfully to reveal the graduated shades of green, its center a perfect puddle of quivering green olive oil. That Sunday, Gaugnot opened his house for tea. Beth described the annual event to Jacob as they rode the atelier’s rickety bicycles to the neighboring village where Gaugnot lived, “for privacy,” she said. There would be the sputtering electric kettle from the studio, lugged over by Carney for the occasion. There would be a decorative tin filled with biscuits that seemed always the same, and, if they were lucky, there might be a perfect tarte aux fraises made by a neighbor. The point was not to have tea, Beth said, but to page gingerly through Gaugnot’s sketches and notes, and to gaze upon the million dollars’ worth of Gaugnot’s paintings. His agent could get sixty thousand for a commissioned portrait. Most of the work that Gaugnot did these days was by commission; in the winter months, with the atelier out of session, he flew to the States, where clients posed for him. She led Jacob to an imposing stone house near the center of the village. In the hall, she immediately became engrossed in conversation with Carney about the position of Hannah’s head. Beth told Carney he had turned her head slightly to the left, and Carney, uncharacteristically bridled, insisted this was not the case. Hannah stood with them. Occasionally she spoke a few words in accented but fluent English; she had grown up in Nigeria. Jacob noticed that although Beth looked at Carney with forthright insistence, she lowered her eyes when appealing to Hannah. Curious to see the art, Jacob made his way into the sitting room. From floor to ceiling, the walls were hung with Gaugnot’s paintings. Most were portraits and figure studies, displayed simply, although a few were in elaborate old frames that reminded Jacob of those in the Louvre. How had Gaugnot, a penny-pincher, procured them? Yet the paintings deserved the costly frames. They were richly colored, imaginative, beautifully lit. He poured a cup of tea and sat down opposite a large, fanciful still life of peonies, crockery, and what looked like a human rib cage on a table. He could almost see the ribs trembling with phantom breaths. After some time, he recognized the cracked white pitcher from the studio, made unfamiliar by the painter’s touch. “May I sit here?” Hannah stood before the chair he had been saving for Beth. Jacob nodded. She took the seat easily, as if she knew that she could have whatever she wanted in this house, but shyly, as if this privilege did not mean anything to her. She wore jeans, a white blouse, and worn flat sandals. To have her sitting so close to him, however clothed, made him uncomfortable. He stared at the ground, breathing in her scent of local lavender. She was, he knew by now, thirty-six years old, although she looked ten years younger; her age was apparent only in her feet, in the thickened joints behind her big toes. He had never spoken to her. Had not needed to, as the months passed and he began to believe, with pride, that he had managed to evoke something of her radiance in his work. He cleared his throat. “How long have you been modeling for him?” “Eight years,” she said. When he said nothing, stunned by the length of time, she added, “I was in the States. I came to France after my mother died.” She spoke as if she were explaining it to herself as much as to him. “I’m sorry,” he said, automatically. “I was a student here.” Jacob tried to think. “That must be why you really know how to pose,” he said, finally. “You seem very serious.” He choked on a sip of tea. “I’m actually lost,” he said. Fighting down a flicker of pride, he heard himself say, “Where are the paintings of you?” “In another room.” “May I see them?” “It’s the bedroom.” “Oh.” “Do you want to see them?” She was already standing. Together they left the room. She led him up a flight of stairs. The staircase seemed forbidding, and narrow; he smelled a cold, damp smell, more ancient than mildew, emanating from the stones. At the top, she pushed open the dark, heavy-looking wooden door and entered, moving aside for him. “Here they are,” she said, gesturing. Jacob walked around the large room, trying to ignore the bed. Aside from several lamps, and a dresser, and a low seat upholstered with black-and-white toile, there was no other furniture in the room. The walls were covered with paintings, drawings, and sketches. They were undeniably erotic, all of them: the formal studio portrait featuring Hannah’s voluptuously lidded gaze; Hannah looking up from an uncomfortable settee; Hannah with a blue ceramic bowl of peaches; Hannah actually posed in the style of a Gauguin. On the wall opposite the bed was a large canvas. Hannah’s spreading thighs dominated the foreground. In the center of the painting, her vagina. Her torso was foreshortened, her head barely visible. While Jacob studied them, Hannah stood next to him in silence. The paintings were splendid, all of them: masterful in their use of light and shadow. He looked at every work at least twice, but he could not take his eyes away from the painting opposite the bed. It felt exploitative, and yet he could not stop looking at it. When the door creaked open, they turned quickly, as if they had been caught in an embrace. “So here you are,” Gaugnot said. “He asked to see them,” Hannah said, dropping her gaze. The old man’s heavy eyelids flickered, or Jacob would not have known that he had heard. “Wonderful paintings,” Jacob said. “I was admiring the light.” “Yes.” They had a brief technical conversation in which Gaugnot ignored Hannah, explaining to Jacob that warm, interior shadows might seem less pronounced on a winter’s day. Then he switched off abruptly. “We don’t usually allow students to see the room.” He turned to Hannah. “May I speak to you?” Jacob left the bedroom. The door closed firmly behind him. He descended the stone steps, his knees shaking from the shock of seeing the paintings, of being alone in a room with Hannah, of Gaugnot’s appearance. Beth stood at the foot of the stairs. “Come on, Jacob,” she said, grasping his elbow with unexpected force. She led him outside. She gestured with her chin, mounted her bike, and rode out into the lengthening, warm rays. Jacob followed her. “Beth. Hey, Beth.” Halfway to the atelier, he caught up to her. She pumped rapidly, her forehead faintly puckered, refusing to look at him. “C’mon. What is it?” “You shouldn’t have gone up there with her,” she said. “Have you seen that room?” “Once. He was out of town.” As they turned onto the long, uphill lane toward the atelier, Beth said, “He’s going to hold it against you.” “Nah, no way.”  Breathing hard, Beth did not answer. “He barely knows who I am. He’ll forget about it in a week.” “He won’t.” “He gets her wrong, you know,” Jacob blurted. The heat of truth rose into his throat. “There’s an elongation, a distortion in the shape of her body. And it’s more than that one distortion. There’s something missing in her face. He doesn’t see her.” Beth, pedaling determinedly, said nothing. High summer and they were living in a blaze of light. The wheat fields, the barley fields, the grazing fields, the hay fields with their stacks linked up like yellow beads. The sun was unbearable. You only had to stand in it for a few seconds to know it was dangerous. The sun was imperial; it was godly; yet, Jacob sensed the landscape and everything on it was like a slice of bread in a French toaster: scorched only on one side. The backside, the shadow side of everything, was moss and lichen, mold, deeply black. But the light! The light! If only they could paint the light—so fickle, so impossible! Only during their hours in the studio, lit faithfully by the cool light from the north, could they work peacefully, steadily; and yet even in the studio the light played its tricks on such ordinary objects as apples and ginger jars, revealing their utter strangeness. Hannah was, he slowly came to see, if not a muse, a superb model. There was a generosity, an understanding in her stillness. The light against her skin always patient and unmoving. Yet ultimately perplexing. Jacob complained to Beth, “I came here hoping that if only I could learn to paint the world as I see it, then this would transform my work. So far I’ve learned that I can’t paint, and now I’m starting to think that I can’t see.” But as the hot weeks crawled by, almost imperceptibly, things began to shift. He first noticed his progress as an increasing ability to pay attention. He forgot what he was doing for periods of time, and he forgot to worry. Gradually he stopped critiquing what he did, stopped noticing the other students: who was fast or slow, whose easel stood in a better spot. He arrived early in the morning, among the earliest, awaiting Hannah’s arrival with his paints ready. She was always on time; she had begun to say hello to him and sometimes to smile. In an effort to protect both her and himself, he had not spoken to her since the party. He worked hard all day. In the evenings, after supper, he rode his bike around the countryside, and upon returning, he showered and dropped off to sleep. Gaugnot rarely spoke to him now. He worked almost entirely without individual instruction; instead, he learned from listening to Gaugnot’s brief comments to Beth, on his right, and to Lloyd. Submerged as he was, he rarely thought of much other than painting. He did notice that Gaugnot and Hannah did not arrive together anymore, that Hannah was riding her bike in the mornings and not seated in Gaugnot’s little Citroën. There had been some kind of argument, he suspected. Working through the two-hour lunch break, he sometimes caught a murmuring thread of conversation between Hannah and Beth. They sat under the live oak tree, many yards from the window, but when the wind came in a certain direction he could hear them talking. “She painted that green bowl...” “He was afraid of chickens...” They seemed to talk almost entirely about former students. His visit to Gaugnot’s house had changed his canvas. So had seeing Gaugnot’s paintings—so vivid and skillfully done, so enviably finished. And yet, he told himself, somewhat fatuously in the middle of the night, that what he’d said to Beth was true: Gaugnot did not know Hannah. The paintings of her were not complete. As the summer burned toward its final days, he began to secretly believe that his own painting might rival, even surpass, his classmates’ paintings of Hannah. He had no way to know for sure. He didn’t ask Beth for her opinion. She kept her own easel turned away. He refused to ask Thomas. But he began to wonder if the man’s very silence was a sign of respect. Jacob had watched his teacher dab a loaded brush onto his classmates’ paintings with the contemptuous insouciance of a graffiti artist. But Gaugnot did not lay his brush upon Jacob’s painting of Hannah. He avoided it, and Jacob, as if he couldn’t bear the sight of either. Jacob had noticed as an undergraduate in art school that professors dismissed the students who had already failed; it was as if they could not bear the sight of their disappointment, their downward fortunes. But the professors saved their most virulent dislike for the students who rejected them: those who moved on, to another school, another teacher, another realm. Those who didn’t need them or their teaching. Each morning it was Carney’s responsibility to set Hannah’s pose. To aid both of them in this challenging task, Carney taped the places on the floor and the chair where her feet, her hip rested. He kept track of the position of the light on her body, marking the shadows on a sketch he had made of her. But it was impossible, even for Hannah, to sit in one position for months at a time. Gradually, subtly, the habits of her body surfaced. It was a month after the visit to Gaugnot’s house, yet Beth and Carney continued their argument over the pose. “Her head. Her head is in the wrong place.” Carney brought out his sketch and showed Beth: there was the point that the shadow had cast on Hannah’s cheek. “It’s not right,” Beth insisted. “Look,” Jacob said finally, holding up a drawing from his first week at the atelier. “Look at this sketch. The shadow on her cheek is here.” Gaugnot’s thickly accented voice broke into their conversation. “No, no,” he said, and there was something playful but malicious in his tone. “You are wrong.” He prodded Hannah into the more uncomfortable position. “It is here.” For a long moment, Hannah held still. Then, almost undetectably at first, she began to quiver. The painters stopped working, frozen at their easels, stricken by her irregular trembling, her fluttering breath, like the sound of the doves in the eaves. Hannah shook. She fought back sobs. She wrenched herself out of the pose and, snatching up the white robe, ran out of the studio. Jacob looked at Beth. She stood with her head averted and tears in her own eyes. He bounded out the door. Hannah had neared her bicycle beneath the oak; he had almost reached speaking distance when she placed one foot on the near pedal and swung her leg gracefully over the back wheel. Jacob turned and raced to the barn where he kept his bike. By the time he returned to the courtyard she was well ahead of him, her white robe fluttering behind her. He followed the vanishing speck of white. She took the south road out of town, past two cow pastures and a field of mown hay. The road was on an incline, and it was almost a kilometer before his voice reached her. “Go away,” she said. He thought of the stricken studio. “Hey,” he panted. “Give me a break.” Almost imperceptibly, she sped up. He was out of breath and did not try to speak again. She veered right after another cow pasture and rode down the long hill toward the stream, then up a short rise. There she turned down an unfamiliar road and Jacob, mystified, followed at a greater distance. She seemed to know exactly where she was going. They passed a house with chicken pens and a barking dog, then rode along the crest of a long hill, from which Jacob could see, to his right, a bluff and then a series of fields and trees, golden and dark green, gradually shading to the horizon. Before them, a small stone chapel appeared. Hannah dismounted. She leaned her bike against the chapel, climbed the two stone steps, tugged open one of the heavy wooden doors, entered, and shut the door behind her. When Jacob reached the little chapel, he leaned his bicycle against its wall. Above the door, a gilt sign read chapelle du st. francaire. He sat down on the steps. From this vantage point he could see, twisting among the trees below, a creek. Beyond it, a perfect field of yellow wheat, moving into the layers of green and gold. His breathing settled, things grew altogether silent. Beyond the field he glimpsed a pasture and cows, then the red-tiled roof of a dilapidated barn, and beyond that the turrets of a small chateau. The landscape held the still detachment of a dream. It was perhaps half an hour before the door behind him creaked open. Hannah sat down next to him. The white robe was pulled tight and knotted around her waist. She seemed chastened and calm; he wondered if she had been praying. “I’m in rural France,” he said. He had just now begun to believe it. She said, “The chapel was built for a local saint.” He nodded but could not think of a response. After a moment, she added, “It’s built over the site of a perpetual stream. I’ll show you.” She stood up and gestured to him. He got to his feet, his muscles protesting, and followed her behind the chapel and down a steep path that switched back and forth until they reached a cairn. The stones shielded a mossy, tiny trickle of water. For quite a while they stood before the little cairn. Jacob read the inscription in French, please respect this source. Hannah said, “The locals have always felt it was a holy site. The water from this stream never stops. About a hundred years ago they built the chapel, but sometimes they hold services here.” She pointed to candle drippings on the rocks. “How did you find it?” She shrugged. “I’ve had a lot of time to ride around, when Thomas is painting.” “How did you get involved with him?” She knelt to dip her fingers in the stream. “It’s hard to explain.” “What are you doing here?” Jacob persisted. “Why here? Why with him?” She shrugged again. After a moment, he knelt beside her. “It was eight years ago,” she said. “I was at loose ends. My dad was far away, my mother had died, and she was estranged from our family in Nigeria, I barely knew them. I had an undergraduate degree in painting—and I heard about Thomas. I had some savings, so I came to study with him.” “And then?” “After a couple of years, I ran out of money.” He turned to look at her. She had pulled her hair back into a thick braid, and he could see her features clearly. She looked out at the layers of green and gold, and he examined her familiar profile in the light. “He started paying me to pose after class. He was working on a figure drawing and then a painting. It took months. He never said a word to me, the whole time. During breaks, I would drink tea by myself. After a few hours he would bring his brushes to the sink, and I would leave without saying goodbye. There was another model at the time, Bianca. She was my friend, and we would talk in class, during the breaks. But he never asked for Bianca. I thought he must like me because I could hold a pose. I never asked him if I could see the painting. Of course, I was afraid of him. I could feel it—that thing people talk about, that kind of influence. Then one day, he took me by the shoulders and set me in front of the painting.” “The paintings don’t look like you,” Jacob interrupted her. “Even the formal portrait. It’s a good painting, but it doesn’t look like you. Doesn’t capture you—” He stopped, troubled by his choice of words. He had spoken as if she were a fugitive. “What happened then?” he asked, although he had a feeling that he knew. “I thought he would ask me whether I liked it, or whether I thought it looked like me, but he didn’t ask me anything. I wasn’t even sure why he wanted me to look at it. And then he said—” She paused and closed her eyes. Over the past month, Jacob’s desire for her had reached the point where the mere sight of her eyelids made him want ardently to kiss her, but he could not do it. “What did he say?” he asked. “He said that I could stay here, as the model, for as long as I wanted. And that he would give me room and board in exchange.” “You’re a—” Once more, Jacob struggled against the thought, “a captive.” “I tried to leave once,” she said. “I thought of writing to Bianca to borrow money for a plane ticket. She would understand. But when I talked to Thomas—” “He was upset?” “No, that’s the thing—he became so calm when I talked about leaving. He said he knew I wasn’t going to leave. He said that he had already seen it.” “What do you mean?” “He told me all of this has already happened.” Jacob waited a few seconds. “Do you mean,” he prompted, “in a former life? That you and Thomas are lovers reincarnate?” “No.” She frowned, touching her fingertips to the spot above the high bridge of her nose where, Jacob had noticed, faint vertical lines were visible only in the mornings. “He said that this whole world has already happened. That we had always been, and would always be, lovers, and that we would make love again and again; that everything we’ve done exists in a kind of continuous loop that replays itself, over and over. Somewhere, it already exists. The bedroom I had, in our old house, before my mother died—I had told him about my bedroom and our house—somewhere on the loop, it still exists, and I am still five, it’s still my room—” “That’s eternal recurrence,” Jacob interrupted her. “From Nietzsche. Among others.” “Well, I thought it was dopey,” she said, smiling ruefully. “It seemed all right, all of a sudden, to make him happy, to stay with him a little longer, silly man.” The line between her brows deepened. “But that happened before I knew I was no good,” she said. “I still thought I was going to be a painter.” She laid her long-fingered, graceful hands on the pointed stones of the cairn, touching each one gently. Jacob raised his eyes above the cairn and let the light blind them, splinter them with sunspots and sun devils and floaters and blue beams. “It’s Nietzsche,” he repeated into the blindness. “Eternal recurrence. But Thomas is ignoring the important part.” Nietzsche had made it into an ethical question: What kind of life do you live? If a demon came to you and asked, “Would you live your life again?” what would you decide? Jacob envisioned his mother hoarding her notebooks of small sketches, she who had been so set against his going to art school. “After everything that happened, it was too odd for me to stay in the class,” Hannah said. “Anyway, I wasn’t very good.” A silence followed her words. Jacob took his eyes away from the sun and looked toward her. He felt an overmastering impulse to reach for her, to feel her mouth press warmly through the fiery circle where the sun had been, her body against his. But something held him back. It was not fear of consequences or even caution. Instead, a confusing tenderness filled him. He gestured toward the chapel and their waiting bicycles. Every day, through the months of August and September, when the class broke for their long lunch, he got onto his bicycle and met with Hannah at the chapel. No one asked them what they did. They never saw anyone coming up the hill. Inside the chapel it was cool and dark. Someone did come by when they weren’t there, someone dusted the pots of plastic flowers that surrounded a statuette of the saint, someone placed glass vases of Peruvian lilies at the gated front of the chapel and at the statue’s feet. They blocked the door shut with their bicycles, and Hannah covered St.Francaire’s face with her sun hat so that the saint would not be offended by their using the chapel as a place to eat and talk. She was always chilly in the chapel, with its stone floor and thick walls. Jacob, in a fit of tenderness, brought one of his ragged sweaters for her. She spoke about her mother’s illness and about her father in Nigeria, whom she had not seen since childhood and felt she could not ask for money. He told her about his own parents, who had lost their shoe repair business, and whom he had disappointed so baldly and so thoughtlessly that he couldn’t bear to speak to them more than once every couple of months. He told her about his lack of early artistic training and his own struggle with painting, of how he, too, had known that sense of being no good; but he was too ashamed to speak of his ambition. Each day, he emerged from the chapel to a delicious feeling of distance, looking over the fields and trees and, far away, the tiny, flightless windmill. At night, when he woke fitfully to scratch his insect bites, their conversations preoccupied him. All of their long hours became one. The weather turned, and the painters began to wear fleeces and woolen socks. Jacob thought he might find a part-time job on a local farm, remain in France over the winter. He might somehow stretch his savings, stay at the atelier, for years. It seemed essential to be present, to make more paintings of Hannah. He felt as if he were on the brink of understanding. In his final weeks on the painting, he felt a growing sadness throughout his body. The mornings were still radiant and the light of the sun thinner but still golden. One morning in early October, the sky was leaden. Through the gray fog, an intense damp pervaded; the world had turned upside down again; coldness, wetness, darkness, had emerged. Jacob pulled on his overcoat before setting off across the scruffy courtyard for the studio. There he would make tea, get out his brushes. He arrived at the barn to find, posted on the door, a sheet of paper. It was the list of students Thomas had accepted for the following year. His name was not among them. “Are you in love with her?” Beth asked. They were alone in the studio. After a moment, Jacob missed the scraping sound of her palette knife. He waited until the sound began again before he replied. “Sure,” he said. “Sure, I’m in love with her.” Beth was making rich, luxurious piles of green paint. Dark green this time, the color of the magisterial, dry-leafed oaks against the bleached yellow fields. “What are you going to do about it?” But must one do something about an emotion, once it had been identified? “She’s older than me,” he said. This was true, although he felt that he was lying. “And there’s Thomas,” Beth added, mounding the dark heap with her knife. But they both knew that Jacob had no reason to try to please Thomas now. Beth piled half of the glossy dark green into a tube, then squeezed a dab of cadmium yellow into the remaining pile and began to scrape and mix again. Jacob bent to his work, relieved the conversation had ended. But presently, Beth spoke again. “Will you take her with you?” Was she pushing the palette knife a little harder than before? Jacob put down his brush. Beth’s lips were pressed in a line. There was a pink spot in her cheek. Cruelty rose, pushed away shame. “Why don’t you leave and take her with you?” Beth’s arm jerked across the paint. His friendship with Hannah had been possible only because of Gaugnot. Gaugnot commanded every circumstance, and Jacob was now banished; there was no point in seeing it any other way. He finished the painting two weeks later. In those final days, seeking light and warmth, they ate their lunches outside the chapel. The fields had faded to layers of brown and ash-blond. She was right there with him and he wasn’t afraid of what would happen next. In truth, he was invulnerable. Nothing—not Thomas, nor even Hannah—could touch him. He would return to New York, and this time he would succeed. He need never lose these seasons in France, these rides to the chapel. The conversation near the cairn, the eternal spring. He knew he could return to this, again and again. It would exist forever. Anyway, he had the painting. He told himself that he would always keep the painting. And he managed to hold on to it for years, although upon his return to New York he fell into a predictable and seemingly endless trough of financial desperation. He had been in France for only half a year, and yet many elements of his old life had changed or vanished. Charlotte lived upstate now; she had stopped teaching and was engaged to a neurologist. Their old building had been cleared out, to be redone as condominiums. Everyone was leaving Manhattan; it was becoming a clean, orderly space for new people and new businesses. Jacob got a job as a waiter at a new restaurant to pay the rent on a studio deep in Brooklyn; he fought against a terrible artistic emptiness for more than a year; finally he returned to his old abstract work. He threw himself into this effort to the point of exhaustion, and he didn’t phone his parents or give them his address. He made mistakes at the restaurant. He was fired from that job; he moved, again and again, from a one-room walk-up to a share, to a rooming house, and then into his unheated studio. Finally, he was obliged to leave his studio. On a bleak evening in late winter, while cleaning out his things, he came across, as if anew, the canvas. The image was breathtaking. Her hair, the light upon her dark skin, the shape of her body, appeared unreal, even mocking. It was all more lovely than what could be imagined or untrue. Examining the painting, he knew his pointless study of technique had met, in this one instance, a subject worthy of such faithful representation—knew it was only Thomas’s obsession with technique that had made it doable. He began to wonder whether his reimmersion in abstract work, in any art, would be merely a long and self-deluded aftermath of this one painting. The following autumn, when his new abstract work—which he understood to be empty, belabored, hard-edged, and lacking love—had unexpectedly found him a downtown Manhattan gallery, and then a one-man show, and suddenly an agent, he received a postcard from Beth. It had been forwarded twice, and after months had finally reached him at the gallery. He stood for an eternity on the street, deciphering and rereading her tiny script. In the spring, with the departure of Carney, she had moved her easel to the best spot in the studio. In June, she had finally learned to capture a red field poppy in its three days of life. “Also,” she wrote, “Hannah and Thomas have had a child, a daughter, Angevine.” In the dark time that followed the receipt of the postcard, Jacob shoved the painting of Hannah behind a stack of new canvases. Months later, forgetting what he had done, he showed the stack of canvases to his agent. When she came upon the painting of Hannah, she let it sit before them for a moment. Jacob saw a pulse twitch in her throat. Then she recovered herself. “What am I supposed to do with this?” She laughed, and added reluctantly, admiringly, “Although, it is beautiful.” “Do what you do,” he said. The agent brought the painting to an auction where none of the clients would know Jacob’s reputation as an abstract painter. It sold immediately, for sixty thousand dollars, to an anonymous buyer from Europe. In the years that followed, although Jacob tried repeatedly to buy back the painting, and as the auction value of his abstract canvases grew to match, and then surpass, that sum, he was unable to trace the buyer.

        "story": "Pen remembers it all. It was 1968. They took a family vacation to Sanibel. Pen’s father drove the station wagon. He held the wheel tightly and gritted his teeth and smoked cigarettes when he wasn’t gritting his teeth. Pen’s mother sat in the front seat. She wore a blue scarf and black sunglasses and kept saying, “Slow down, Cal. What’s the point in speeding? This is a vacation, right? You’re supposed to be relaxing. That’s what the doctor said. Relax.” Pen and her brother Thomas sat in the back seat. It was a big back seat; but Pen felt crowded, as if there were more people in the car than there actually were. Before they left for Sanibel, Pen and her mother had gone to the circus together, just the two of them, and Pen had watched in disbelief and horror as clown after clown climbed out of a very small car. “Infinity,” Thomas had explained to her once, “is where nothing ever ends. It’s where everything just goes on and on.” It was an infinity of clowns, and Pen was terrified. She had started to cry. Her mother said, “Jesus Christ, I’ve never seen a kid cry about the clown car. And I’ve seen everything.” This was something her mother said a lot: “I’ve seen everything! I’ve seen it all!” But at the same time, she kept having to say, “I’ve never seen anything like it.” It was confusing. Who knew what she had actually seen? In any case, Pen couldn’t stop thinking about all the clowns packed into that tiny car. It made her queasy-stomached to consider them—their white faces and sad mouths and big, round noses. “Pen looks funny,” said Thomas. “Be more specific,” said Pen’s father. “Her face is green,” said Thomas. Pen vomited. And then she vomited again. The seating in the car was rearranged. Thomas moved up front. Pen sat alone in the middle of the back seat with the windows rolled down. She forgot about the clowns for a while. When they arrived in Sanibel, invisible flies were waiting for them. The flies bit them as soon as they stepped out of the station wagon. Pen and Thomas and her mother and father all slapped at their faces, their arms and legs. “What the hell?” said Pen’s father as he twirled around, waving his hands. It was funny, watching him, but Pen knew not to laugh. The lady who was renting them the house came toward them smiling and slapping at her face. “You must be the famous judge,” she said, holding out her hand to Pen’s father. “What an honor to have you and your family here. I’m Mrs.Colwood.” Mrs.Colwood shook Pen’s father’s hand. She shook Pen’s mother’s hand. She patted Pen on the head. “You get used to the flies,” said Mrs.Colwood. “And it’s worth it! Oh my goodness, is it ever worth it! The views here are unparalleled. You’re right on the water, as you can see.” “Actually,” said Thomas later, when he and Pen were sitting together on the couch in the living room, “if you ask me, we’re too close to the water for comfort. There are enormous fish lurking out there. They’re man-eating fish and they’re just waiting for us to make a mistake.” Thomas was nine years old—three years older than Pen. He knew more than she did. Or he pretended like he knew more. Also, he made things up. They ate dinner together at a glass-top table in the dining room. Pen found it disconcerting to look down and see her feet. They looked so small, too small for the job of carrying her through the world. Pen and her father were on one side of the table and Thomas and her mother were on the other. From Pen’s side of the table, you could see the water. The sun was setting. It hung over the water in a thoughtful, reluctant way—as if there were something it had meant to do and hadn’t gotten done. “Everyone to bed,” said her father when dinner was over. “It’s been a long day.” “It’s been a long day is right,” said her mother as she laced a pair of boxing gloves onto Pen’s hands. “The days are always long around here.” It was a rule—her father’s rule—that Pen had to sleep in boxing gloves to keep her from sucking her fingers at night. The boxing gloves were orange. They had kangaroos printed on them. Which was supposed to make them fun somehow, but the gloves weren’t fun at all. In the middle of the night, Pen would wake up holding her boxing-gloved hands in front of her face and think: Who took my hands? How can I get them back? It was a relief each morning when Pen’s mother unlaced the gloves and Pen found that her hands still existed. “You’ll be grateful to me someday,” her father said at the breakfast table as Pen sat beside him facing the sea. “You don’t want to ruin the shape of your mouth, do you? You need to have a pretty mouth.” Thomas said, “But how can you ruin the shape of your mouth?” “By running it all the time,” said her father. “So why don’t you shut up for once? Learn to keep your own counsel.” Pen looked past Thomas. She stared at the Gulf of Mexico. The water was so blue it had become green. It looked like a painting. She saw a dolphin leap out of the water. “Can people ride dolphins?” said Pen. “No,” said Thomas. “But I saw a picture once of someone riding a dolphin,” said Pen. “It was made-up then,” said Thomas. “Dolphins aren’t as nice as they look. They have teeth. Everything out there is dangerous.” Pen’s father pushed his chair back from the table and lit a cigarette. “Stop smoking,” said Pen’s mother. “That was another thing the doctor suggested. Give up cigarettes.” Pen’s father blew a smoke ring above his head; when Pen looked up at it, he winked at her and smiled. “Yep,” he said. “Stop smoking. That will help with the stress for sure.” After breakfast, Pen went up to her room and crawled under the bed and sucked her fingers until she felt calmer. “Fee fi fo fum!” her father shouted from downstairs. “Let’s get out on that beach and have some fun!” Pen rolled out from under the bed. She got out of her pajamas and put on her bathing suit, but by the time she made it down the stairs and outside, Thomas had locked himself in the station wagon. Her father was standing very close to the windshield shouting, “Unlock the door, you little shit! Unlock the door now!” Her mother stood next to her father. She had on her blue scarf and her dark sunglasses. “Stop yelling,” she said. “It’s not doing any good.” Pen’s father had a cigarette in one hand. The other hand was curled into a fist that he was using to beat on the windshield. Sweat was pouring down his face. The invisible flies were biting. Pen’s father stopped pounding on the windshield so that he could spend some time slapping at his face and arms. Meanwhile, Thomas sat in the car, in the driver’s seat, with his arms folded, staring off into the distance. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Pen’s mother. After what seemed like a very long time, Thomas opened the door and climbed out of the station wagon. “What is your problem?” shouted Pen’s father as Thomas walked past him. “Tell me. What is it? Huh? What’s your problem?” “Let it go, Cal,” said Pen’s mother. “This is supposed to be a vacation. Remember?” “Yes,” said her father. “I remember.” “Why don’t you just do what he wants?” Pen said to Thomas later, when they were sitting on the seawall. “Look,” said her brother. “I’m working on a way to get us out of here, okay?” “How?” said Pen. Thomas turned and looked at her. “I think I can make the car fly,” he said. “You know. Like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.” “Oh,” said Pen. They had watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the Goldbergs’ house on the Goldbergs’ TV. Pen’s father didn’t believe in TV, and so they didn’t have one. Her mother didn’t believe in TV, either. Or that was what she said. But once, Pen and her mother were downtown together and they had walked by a store with a whole wall of TVs, and all of them were showing the same thing: a bunch of ladies standing in a row, dressed in spangly costumes, kicking their legs up in the air and smiling. Her mother had dropped Pen’s hand and stopped and stared at the TVs. She said, “That was me.” Pen looked up at the wall of dancing women. “I used to do that,” said her mother. “I was a chorus girl. A Darzy girl. This was a long time ago. Before your father showed up. He put a stop to all that, of course.” “Oh,” said Pen. “But my legs were made for it,” said her mother. “That was what Fred Darzy said. And he was the best there was.” Pen and her mother stood in front of the TVs for a long time. The smiling, kicking ladies kept smiling and kicking, kicking and smiling. They didn’t look like they ever intended to stop. “I had a real spark,” said her mother. “I’m going to start with the ignition,” said Thomas as he and Pen sat together on the seawall. “He hides the keys, so I need to figure out a way to start the car without them. I need a screwdriver, I guess. And some wires.” “And wings,” said Pen. “You need wings. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang had wings.” “One step at a time,” said her brother. That night, before she went to sleep, Pen held the boxing gloves up in front of her face and studied them. The gloves weren’t really to stop people from sucking their fingers. That wasn’t what they were made for. They were made for people to hit other people. The gloves were for hurting people. You wore them so that you could hit someone and hurt them without hurting them too much. One time, Pen’s father had gotten so mad at Thomas that he had picked him up by the hair. “I did it so that I wouldn’t really hurt him,” her father had explained to her mother afterward. “It was a reasoned, calculated move, a way to get my point across.” What had his point been? Pen couldn’t remember. But when she asked Thomas if it hurt to get picked up by the hair, he said, “Yes. It hurt a lot.” Pen studied the smiling kangaroos on the boxing gloves. The kangaroos had on boxing gloves, too. And the kangaroos’ boxing gloves had kangaroos printed on them. And even though she couldn’t see it, Pen thought that the kangaroos on the kangaroos’ gloves probably had kangaroos printed on them, too. It was an infinity of kangaroos and boxing gloves. Which was alarming. But not as alarming as an infinity of clowns. The next morning, they all went to the beach together. They sat on lawn chairs. It was cold. Little crabs went in and out of holes in the sand. The crabs were translucent, almost invisible. They looked like ghosts. “Why don’t you two make a sandcastle?” said Pen’s mother. “I’m reading,” said Thomas. He was dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans. “Where’s your swimsuit?” said Pen’s father. “Leave him alone, Cal,” said her mother. “I’m not bothering him,” said her father. “I’m asking him a question. A reasonable question. We’re at a beach. People wear swimsuits at the beach.” “Make a sandcastle, Pen,” said her mother. Pen got out of her chair and knelt in the sand. “Am I bothering you?” Pen’s father said to Thomas. Her brother looked up from his magazine. A ghost crab ducked into a hole. “Yes,” said Thomas. “You’re bothering me.” Pen’s father stood and lunged forward. He picked Thomas up by the ears and lifted him up out of his lawn chair. “Jesus Christ,” said her mother. “Put him down, Cal.” Her father gritted his teeth. He held on to Thomas’s ears. Thomas smiled a big, terrible smile. Tears rolled down the side of his face. “Stop it,” whispered Pen. Her father slowly lowered Thomas to the sand beside Pen. “Pick up your chairs,” said Pen’s mother when Thomas was back on the ground. “We’re leaving.” “Don’t worry,” Thomas said to Pen as they walked up to the house, “he can’t stop me. He won’t stop me.” Thomas’s ears were red. It looked as if someone had tried to set him on fire. Pen slipped her hand in his. Later that day, they all got in the station wagon to drive to town for ice cream cones. “What the hell?” said Pen’s father. “Look at this.” Pen’s mother leaned over and looked where her father was pointing. She lowered her sunglasses. “See that? There’s scratches all over the steering column! And something is stuck in the ignition. Somebody tried to steal this car!” Pen put her fingers in her mouth. Thomas started to hum. “I’m calling the cops,” said her father. “I can’t believe this.” Thomas leaned over and whispered in Pen’s ear, “I’m going to make a break for it. You should run, too. We should all run.” And then he opened the door and he was gone. Pen’s father turned his head slowly in the direction of Thomas. He turned his head back again and stared straight ahead. There were only three of them in the car now. For some reason, three seemed like a scarier number than infinity. After the circus, Pen had asked Thomas about the clowns—about how so many of them could fit in one small car. “They don’t,” said Thomas. “There’s a trapdoor under the car. And they climb up out of that.” “What’s a trapdoor?” Pen had asked. “It’s a hidden door,” said Thomas. “Hidden doors are everywhere. Hidden doors are all over the place but no one ever talks about them.” Pen knew that her brother made up a lot of things, but for some reason she felt as though he was telling the truth about trapdoors. “I’m going to kick the shit out of him,” said Pen’s father from the front seat. “Oh, calm down,” said Pen’s mother. “Isn’t that the whole point of this trip? For you to calm down?” Invisible flies came in through the open back door. They started biting Pen’s face and neck. Pen’s father beat his hands on the steering wheel and then he got out of the car and slammed the door. Pen and her mother sat and waited—one of them in the front seat and the other in the back. “I suppose I’ll have to go find your brother,” said her mother. She got out of the car and then Pen was alone. She sat there until the tow truck arrived, its yellow lights flashing. The man who drove the tow truck had a patch on his shirt that said gene in cursive letters. When he saw Pen sitting in the car, he said, “Hey there, cutie. You’re going to have to get out of the car now.” Gene gave her a yellow lollipop. “You don’t need that,” said her father. He took the lollipop from Pen. “It’ll just rot your teeth.” “Okay,” said Pen, and she stood beside her father and watched while the car got hooked up to the tow truck. “Your brother has some real problems,” said her father. He took hold of her hand. “He’s not like you and me, you know. He would never be able to appreciate a Picasso.” The Goldbergs, in addition to owning a TV, had a painting by Picasso. The Picasso hung on the wall in the dining room. The painting was called Weeping Woman, but the crying lady’s face was not put together right. It looked like a face, and also not like a face. Pen’s father had walked into the dining room once and seen Pen standing in front of the painting, staring up at it. He said, “That’s a famous painting you’re looking at, Pen. It’s called Weeping Woman. It’s by a man named Picasso.” “Oh,” said Pen. “What do you think the painting is about, huh? Any thoughts?” And Pen had said, “The lady is broken and she’s trying to put herself back together but she can’t figure out how to do it.” “You’ve got a good eye, Penelope,” her father said. “You’re like me. You see things.” He had taken hold of her hand. “You know that I’m the one who named you, right? Penelope. Because Penelope was the one who waited. Penelope was the one who was faithful. I looked at your face when you were born and I knew you would never betray me.” He squeezed her hand. Now, as the tow truck pulled away, dragging the station wagon behind it, Pen’s father kept hold of her hand. He squeezed it harder and harder. The mechanic was able to replace the ignition on the station wagon. He made shiny new keys for the car, and Thomas had to stand on one foot in a corner of the house, staring into nothing with his hands over his head, for a solid hour. That was his punishment. “Next time,” said Thomas to Pen as he stood in the corner. “I will succeed.” “No talking,” said Pen’s father. “Penelope, leave him alone. He deserves to be punished.” “But there’s no stopping me,” whispered Thomas over and over again, “there is no stopping, no stopping me, no stopping me at all.” The next morning, before anyone else was awake, Thomas took the new car keys from the table by the door. He went out to the station wagon. He opened all the doors so that they would act as wings. He got behind the wheel and cranked the ignition and stepped on the gas and drove the station wagon out of the driveway and through a hedge and over the seawall and down to the water. By the time Pen and her mother and father made it outside, Thomas was already out of the car and running down the beach. He was running very fast. “I will kill him,” said Pen’s father in a calm and decisive voice, the voice he used when he talked to his secretary, the voice of reason and judgment. He leapt over the seawall and chased after Thomas. When he caught him, he punched him in the stomach again and again. Pen looked up at her mother. She waited for her to say, “I’ve never seen anything like it.” Instead, her mother screamed a loud, terrible, long scream; and then she was running down the beach, too, her nightgown billowing around her. Pen stayed where she was. She was still wearing the boxing gloves. Her hands felt too heavy to lift. The next day, Pen and Thomas flew back home to Philadelphia with their mother. Before they left, they went down to the beach—this was after the car was towed, after Pen’s father had disappeared. They went down to the water, the three of them, so that Pen could get rid of her boxing gloves. It was her mother’s idea. “Do you hate these as much as I do?” she had said to Pen when she was packing their suitcases. Pen nodded. “Good,” said her mother. “We’ll get rid of them then.” Pen threw the gloves into the water. They floated, bobbing on the surface. “It will take a while,” said her mother. “But they’ll disappear.” It wasn’t as cold as the day before. They sat together on the beach, the three of them. Thomas read his magazine. Her mother held her face up to the sun. Pen worked on a sandcastle. She collected tiny pink shells that looked like butterfly wings. The shells were strewn everywhere on the beach. They were infinite, and Pen used them to decorate her castle. “That’s pretty,” her mother said to her. “That’s a very pretty castle, Pen.” It turned out that Pen’s father had checked himself into a mental institution. Later, they went to visit him. A nurse named Linda led the three of them through a series of locked doors and down a long hallway into a room with a TV and armchairs and folding chairs and tables with puzzles on them. Her father cried when he saw them. He pulled Thomas to him and hugged him. “Penelope,” said her father. “Come here. Let me hold you.” She went toward him. She let herself be held. Afterward, Linda the nurse gave Pen a striped piece of gum that tasted like fruit. Pen chewed the gum as she walked down the long hallway through the doors and out into the world. Her brother remembers none of this. Or he says he remembers none of it. “But you destroyed the car,” said Pen. “You tried to turn it into Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.” “Well, I remember Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” said Thomas. “And the Child Catcher.” “The Child Catcher,” said Pen. “Yeah,” said her brother. “Because kids were against the law, remember? They all had to hide in the grotto of the castle.” And suddenly, Pen was back on the beach in Sanibel, building a castle with a great hidden room beneath it, a place where the children could hide. She added pink shells to the exterior, making the castle as beautiful as she could—so beautiful that no one would ever think to look beneath it. “Does this shell have a name?” she had asked her mother. “It’s a rose tellin,” said her mother. Pen liked the way the words sounded. She had used them to make a song. “Rose tellin, rose tellin,” she sang to herself as she worked. “I am Rose Tellin, building a castle in the sand.” Each time she looked up from the castle, she saw that the boxing gloves had gone farther away. Soon, just as her mother had promised, she couldn’t see them at all. They had disappeared entirely.

        "story": "I was splitting wood at sunset when the cat jumped up on the chopping block in front of me, arched her back, and took a long piss. My axe hung in the sky. The cat stared at me, tail up. I put my axe down and squatted before her. I hitched my gown to my waist. I sent my own stream into the brown leaves. The cat narrowed and widened her yellow eyes at me, which is what cats do because they can’t blink. Our eyes locked as we added our nitrogen to the landmass. She broke first, streaking back into the woods. I’ve never seen a cat piss or shit, not once they are out of their resentful kittenhood. Cats are private about such things. I have kept cats all my life. I say kept because my neighbor in these woods reminds me that no one can own a cat, not really. He says I should be more careful about language. He says that words have power. My hope every day is that he will leave me in peace. I swung my axe, trying to beat the dusk. I am particular about firewood. Sometimes firewood can feel like my whole life. Tulip poplar wants to burn but it doesn’t give off much heat. I use it for kindling. It splits like a wooden xylophone. Listen for that muffled bell toll. White elm is scarce now and red elm leaves behind clinkers. It will do. Across the grain, it’s a rich color without being ornate, which some people appreciate. Hickory rots at the center so you can split it in a circle, like unmaking a barrel. If it’s summertime and you’re cutting live trees, you’re screwed. You’ll be burning green wood all winter. All those long dark days your wood will spit at you, refuse to catch, need constant tending, smoke you out of your place without keeping you warm, and that’s not the worst of it. The worst of it is that green wood will build up creosote in your chimney, and your chimney will catch fire, and the fire will spread to your house, and your house will burn down and what will you do then. My neighbor in these woods has already split, seasoned, and stacked all the wood he will burn this year. He did this last spring at the first thaw, as he has done every spring for the past twenty years. I don’t cut live trees anymore. When I need to warm myself, I look for standing dead. All winter, I stay one fire ahead of the cold. I’ve never been good at planning. I don’t know what’s going to happen and I don’t know why. I am, however, curious. Oak will burn all night. Persimmon is good hard wood but let it be. Wait for the first freeze and you’ll get fruit like deflated jewels. Ash was on the chopping block in front of me, soaked in the urine of the cat. The emerald ash borer, radiant and misplaced, has killed all the ash, so what to do but fell it and watch its bark fall off like meat from the bone. Green ash burns better than any other green wood, though it’s useless to learn this. You should not burn green wood and you will not find an ash tree left alive. Mid-swing, I saw it. Glistening in the piss. I bent to look. A drawing. A drawing in blue ink embedded in the tree rings. Nuanced borders, detailed topography, small as a badge. I had opened a tree and inside it found a map. My neighbor used to have a book called Seeing Through Maps, written in a teacherly way that set my teeth on edge. “There are no rules for making maps,” the book said, clearly a trick to get you to let down your guard. Of course there are rules. You’ll be likely to break them. A map, by definition, is limiting. As with a journal, or any cavalier use of text, a map may help you remember things, but also invent a way of remembering them that makes you forget everything important. Instead of a journal, I made lists so banal that they unleashed my imagination in revolt against the tiresome record of my life. Instead of maps, I stayed home. I am certain my neighbor still has that book. He never gets rid of a damn thing that makes him feel good about himself. There were two passages I could tolerate: “A map’s quality is the function of its purpose.” Also: “If you are making a map for your own purposes and do not care who else can read it—or do not want anyone else to be able to read it—the map need not even be intelligible to others.” I put my face close enough to smell the ammonia. The blue lines could be a stamp, a tattoo, an island, a spit, an isthmus, a lake, a mountain of two lopsided circles. As a map it was unintelligible to me. Which, according to Seeing Through Maps, meant that I was not meant to understand it. Is what I was thinking, leaning on my axe, when my neighbor appeared at the property line. I had marked those trees with orange blazes yet still I was not left alone. I could see him there, out of the corner of my eye, his patched coat that he’d made from three other coats, his tattered hood, his dirty scarf. “Permission to cross,” he said. “Do it, then,” I said, and then I saw that he held his left hand awkwardly with his right as if it were an object separate from his body, and I saw that his left thumb was hanging from his left hand and that all the darkness he was flinging around, darker than dusk, was blood. “I’m not sure I can drive myself to the emergency room,” he said, approaching. He had the pallor of someone in shock but still I could hear the recrimination in his voice. I waited to hear how his severed thumb was my fault. I was curious. My neighbor used to be my husband and neither of us has forgotten it. “I was splitting kindling and the hatchet slipped,” my neighbor said. “You know, the hatchet that you gave me because you gave my first hatchet away.” He slumped against a sycamore, a tree that can give you a cough. It’s true that I gave him a hatchet when we were first married, a beautiful curved instrument with a handle of striped walnut and a razor edge. It’s true that some years ago I reclaimed the hatchet so I could give it to our other neighbor, the younger one. When you give a gift, it’s important to give the best of what you have, not the least of what you have. My neighbor’s hatchet was the best thing I had. Of course I replaced it, but he remained angry. It’s easy to give the best of what you have when the best of what you have belongs to someone else, he said. Maybe so. But if you had seen our young neighbor, a radiant person, you too would have given him a beautiful hatchet. You would have given him everything you had. Before he was our neighbor, he was our son. But it had been so long since I’d seen him, so long since I’d heard his voice, I was no longer sure whether I should call him our neighbor or call him something else, or no longer refer to him at all. “That ash looks wet,” my neighbor said, squinting past me at the round as if it was his damn eyeballs that had been severed. “Don’t talk,” I said. “Conserve your strength.” I tore a strip of cloth from my undergarment. My neighbor grunted as I tied his thumb back on the best I could. The blood soaked through the undergarment. I tore another strip. I tried not to breathe him in. “Is it green?” he asked. “I don’t burn green wood,” I said. “Anymore,” he said. “You don’t burn green wood anymore. Let’s at least be accurate.” “It’s cat piss,” I said. I let him lean on me as I guided him to the truck. I buckled his seat belt because he could not do it himself. I told him about the cat leaping onto the log, the eye contact, the stream of urine. I did not mention the map. I could see that through his pain he’d found something to focus on. “The problem with you is that you have no respect for anything,” he said as I coaxed the engine. “When animals act like that, you should stop what you are doing. You should call it a day. You should go inside and shut the door tightly and stoke your fire.” “But I didn’t have any firewood,” I said. The shocks were shot. The struts were rusted. At the bottom of the hill, the forest ended, and we waited at the railroad tracks as the coal train crept past, hopper car after hopper car, though I always looked for a boxcar, curious to see if someone might be inside. “Chopping wood out of season,” he said, shaking his head. “Then the cat pees on the chopping block at dusk. Then you snub your nose at omens because you are desperate for warmth. Now you see what that leads to.” He held up his thumb, trailing my undergarment. Finally, the striped gate lifted. The light switched from red to green. I steered around the potholes, the ruts and deep ditches, to the highway. If my neighbor had bled out while waiting for the train to pass he would have found some way to reprimand me for that too. He wasn’t one to let a little thing like death stand in his way. It must be comforting to my neighbor to know with such certainty how one thing leads to another. Causality is one of the major world religions, one of the last great articles of faith. To me, it is one of the great mysteries. And what is causality but blame? The emergency room was full of all the people we tried to avoid, I mean any people at all, in various states of visible and invisible distress. “You should go now,” my neighbor said. “You’ve got no wood and it’s going to be a cold one.” “And how will you get home,” I said, “in the freezing middle of the night with blood loss? You can’t hitchhike with a thumb like that.”  The on-duty nurse, in her rolling chair, asked all the questions that my neighbor answered no to. No regular doctor. No phone number. No emergency contact. No insurance. No income, not this month at least. The nurse rolled her chair, rolled her mouth around. “The doctor will still see you of course,” the nurse said. “But you will be expected to make a payment at the end of your visit.” I lowered my neighbor into a chair like a blue plastic bucket so he could leave a grease stain, which, like I said, no longer had anything to do with me. “We should go,” he said, closing his eyes and forgetting to hold his hand up. “There’s no shame in resting for a minute,” I said. I took him by the elbow and guided his injured hand so that his uninjured hand could hold it. I certainly wasn’t going to. My undergarment grew crispy at the edges. I knew he wanted me to take him home and nurse him. I knew he wanted my entire damn undergarment, strip by strip. In the adjacent bucket seat, a woman bluely changed her baby’s diaper, and the baby was not grateful at all, in fact the opposite. “When my son was a baby,” I told her, “I told him I was going to change him. I meant his diaper. But my husband at the time said, Don’t tell him you’re going to change him because then he’ll believe we don’t accept him as he is. He’ll wonder if the universe fashioned him wrong.” The mother was about to respond, I swear she was, but her baby then kicked orange poop at her so I will never know what she was going to say. “We hope you change,” I said to her baby, watching its mother wipe away the creamy shit while the baby screamed. “Because right now you are less than two feet long and you can’t focus your eyes. You are entirely unreasonable and you are too loud for mixed company.” Words have power, my husband had said to me and to our similarly kicking soiled son. After that I stopped taking him seriously or I started taking him too seriously. Either one is the death of a marriage. “There’s no way I can pay for this,” my neighbor said, grimacing. “We could call him,” I said. “Who,” he said, but I knew he knew. Before he left the woods, our young neighbor had told us both to get health insurance, an easy thing to tell people to do. He told us many things, most of which I can’t remember because I thought he’d be there to remind me. He wanted us to stop replying to Do Not Reply text messages from collection agencies with sentences in all caps such as, YOU WILL NEVER GET A RED CENT FROM ME. It had been our health care strategy while raising him but apparently it was no longer good enough. He had called me exactly one time after I found his lean-to empty. Just to tell you I’m safe, he said. And to tell you I want you and Dad to take care of yourselves. He told me he had a job. A paying one. Something more real than being a consultant but less real than being a carpenter. Something in the middle. I can’t remember. But I remember that he made more in a year than I had made in my whole life. I remember when he told me, how gentle it was. I could hear the whole forest around me, wondering what the hell money was, what the word salary meant, was it close to the word salad or maybe salal. I want to be happy, he said. I want you and Dad to be happy, too. Stupid forest, I said. Doesn’t understand what’s really important. That’s my idea of a joke. That’s irony, which is like ironwood but easier for an axe to go through. My son has not called again. My text messages do not begin with Do Not Reply, but he does not reply. A nurse called my neighbor’s name. He tried to get to his feet but sat back down hard. I hauled him up and went with him into the back and the nurse put us behind a curtain, through which we could hear all the clamor and beeping, the frequencies and trouble and off-color jokes, the tapping and sighing and coughing that filled up that building, which is why we tried to avoid buildings, and each other. But here we were. The nurse took my neighbor’s vitals and asked him why he had filleted his hand. My neighbor looked at me as if I should be the one to answer. “You’re making me hungry with talk like that,” I told her, because unlike my neighbor I understand humor. I understand that people who work in emergency rooms might want to use cooking or food metaphors to approach the horror that is human flesh. Unlike my neighbor I know that sometimes words have so much power that you can’t talk about what you’re talking about. You have to talk about something else. The nurse left us alone, and my neighbor told me to reach into his pocket. “Certainly not,” I said. “It’s on my bad side,” he said. “Help me out.” In his foul pocket were six tiny persimmons. He used his good hand to take three of them. “The persimmon tree is on my side of the line,” I said. “The fruit fell on my side of the line,” he said. We ate the persimmons. They revived my neighbor and they inspired in me a dastardly euphoria, unreplicable. They were exquisite. When the young doctor came in, he tried to shake my neighbor’s hand, then remembered, so he shook hands with me instead. “I’m Dr.Rahim,” he said. “You must be the one making cannibal jokes. We love that kind of thing around here.” Dr.Rahim and I shared a hearty laugh. He read my neighbor’s name off a screen he held in his hand. “Any relation to Duncan?” he asked, sitting down on his own rolling stool and unwrapping my blood-crusted undergarment. Neither my neighbor nor I said anything. “Had to ask,” he said. “Same last name. Small town.” My neighbor closed his eyes, as if it wasn’t his damn last name spilled over onto Duncan and me. “We are Duncan’s parents,” I said. “How about that? I love Duncan,” Dr.Rahim said, inspecting my neighbor’s wound. “Jesus, I’ve seen bratwurst more alive than this.” He winked at me. “Let’s see what we can do.” “I also love Duncan,” I said. “We were buddies in high school,” Dr. Rahim said. “Duncan’s much better at staying in touch than I am. Some people are so good at keeping up old relationships. Those high school days, though. When I think about how much trouble we used to get in.” He laughed. My neighbor opened his eyes. “What kind of trouble,” he asked. Dr.Rahim stopped laughing. “It was a long time ago,” he said. “Still,” my neighbor said. “We are his parents. If he gets into trouble we need to know about it.” “Just teenager stuff,” Dr.Rahim said. He looked at me, as if for assistance. But what did he think I should do? That man was only my neighbor. Only a distant pain. My relationship with my axe meant more to me than my relationship with him. Petting the cat was more interesting to me than my neighbor was. I had worked to edit our relationship back and back so that I barely knew him. Strictly speaking, he was none of my business. Once, when my neighbor was still my husband, he caught me Velcroing Duncan’s tiny shoes, which Duncan could do himself by then but which I preferred to do for him when I could get away with it. My husband explained to me that Velcroing Duncan’s tiny shoes would lead to Duncan becoming prone to vices unimaginable and irreversible. Velcroing Duncan’s tiny shoes was in fact one of the primary ills facing our dying culture. My husband asked several questions, including what was wrong with me. Where to begin. Mean mom, distant father, doesn’t know which colors flatter me, bad at dancing, bad baker, can only sing on key when no one is listening, only apologizes in order to get an apology in return, sad when it rains, can’t shake the childish sentiment that rain is God’s tears, doesn’t believe in God, inattentive pet escort. But by that time he had taken his hatchet and slammed out of the house. He was intuitive, imaginative, generous in his ability to link causes to events in the most expansive and unlikely ways. Yes, sometimes that could be difficult. You can do hard things, he told Duncan, refusing to Velcro his tiny shoes. No one could ever accuse my husband of shrinking before difficulties. Dr.Rahim touched each one of my neighbor’s fingertips, in a way I had never done even when he was my husband. “You’ll need stitches, of course,” Dr.Rahim said. “Likely surgery too if you don’t want the nerve damage to be permanent.” “I can’t afford that,” my neighbor said. “Which,” Dr.Rahim said. “Either,” my neighbor said. “There’s a charity thing the hospital does for indigent or uninsured patients. You can grab the paperwork on the way out.” “I don’t need charity,” my neighbor said. Dr.Rahim frowned. “I understand the two of you may need to talk this over. Why don’t I give you a few minutes.” He once again gave me that significant look, which I had rejected my claim to years ago and did not in any way want back. Dr.Rahim left, and my neighbor and I ate more persimmons. They were like if you never had to eat again. They were anti-patriotic, anti-abundance. They were surrounded by blame but blameless. They were mostly pit, but all around the pit they were perfect. “We should call him,” I said. “I did,” he said. “You did?” I asked. “When?” “Before I came to find you,” he said. “He was the first person I called.” “What did he say?” “I left a message,” he said. “Do you think we were too hard on him?” I asked. “No,” he said. “At least, I wasn’t.” “I actually meant you,” I said. “I didn’t mean me. What about when he climbed the persimmon tree and shook them all down before they were ready and as punishment you made him eat all the unripe fruit until he vomited? What about snapping him into his snowsuit and forcing him to play outside alone in a blizzard?” “You call that a blizzard,” my neighbor said. “What about the nap tent? Knotting the zipper closed and letting him scream and cry sometimes for hours? Do you remember when he was too scared to hike with us in white fur coats along the ridge on a full moon and you made him do it anyway and he wet his pants? What about when you whipped him for insisting that everything was either a dog or a cat?” Maple: cat. Elm: dog. Persimmon: dog. Dogwood: cat. Axe: dog. Hatchet: cat. Truck: dog. Creek: cat. Train: dog. Cat: cat. Squirrel: dog. Raccoon: dog. Spider: cat. It was a small thing, but it enraged my neighbor. Malingering, he called it. It was not honest, nor was it accurate. The one thing that stumped Duncan was a fox. To his father, he’d say that a fox was a dog. But to me he’d say a fox was a cat, because he knew I loved cats and he knew I loved foxes, although it’s been so long since I’ve seen one that I think they might not live in our woods anymore, and Duncan doesn’t live in our woods anymore either. “The research shows it’s not actually people’s parents that make them who they are,” my neighbor said. “It’s other aspects of their environment.” “But what were the other aspects of Duncan’s environment?” I asked. “You mean ash? Hickory? Oak?” “His friends at school, for example,” my neighbor said. “Dr.Rahim. You heard him, they used to get in trouble together, and we’re only finding out about it now.” Dr.Rahim came back. He was looking at his phone. “I have some good news,” he said. “How much does it cost to amputate?” my neighbor asked. “Duncan called,” Dr.Rahim said. “No, he didn’t,” I said. “He texted me,” Dr.Rahim said. “He said, I hope you’re taking good care of my folks. Let them know I’ll pay for it. Don’t let them try to stitch it themselves. Hahaha. But seriously. I told him to contact billing, of course. I don’t take care of all that. But I thought you’d want to know.” “He texted you?” I said. “Yes,” Dr.Rahim said. “That’s gratitude,” my neighbor said. “Imagine that. The people who gave him life.” “He’s paying your medical bill,” I said. “Money means nothing to me,” my neighbor said. “If you don’t mind, I’m going to sew that up for you,” Dr.Rahim said, taking his stool. The nurse brought in a stainless steel tray. “From the cafeteria,” she said, looking at me, but I was no longer in the mood. Dr.Rahim readied the suture. The needle went in and out of my neighbor like he was a burlap sack filled with potatoes or sand. I could not believe such a bloodless man had blood beneath his cracked skin. He watched the suture, chewing on his filthy beard.  My neighbor and I never exchanged rings. Instead, I gave him the hatchet and he gave me the axe I swing to this day. It has some magic in it. I consider it the only other woman around because it’s the only instrument that will do the work the way I want the work done. It’s my only companion, now that Duncan is gone. When I gave Duncan the hatchet, he almost didn’t take it. It’s Dad’s prized possession, he said. How did you even get it from him? I took it back, I said. Does he know you have it? Duncan asked. It belongs to you now, I said. But the hatchet did not make Duncan stay. He took it with him when he left. My neighbor believes that blame, properly assigned, will bring our young neighbor home. What I wouldn’t give to hold such a belief, or any belief at all. If I could rekindle my faith in causality, then what I would like is a map showing me how I got here. I would like a map directing me to Duncan. But no such map exists, or if it does, it’s not a map I am meant to read. I stack wood for our young neighbor that is just the size for the woodstove in his lean-to. I keep his lean-to swept. I feed the cat, even though the cat is really Duncan’s, even though no one can really own a cat. I wait. I’m punky on the inside, fungus-filled. I’m eaten away, barely standing. I’m dead, and I’m burning, burning all the time. “You’re going to have to stay off this hand for a bit,” the doctor said. “Hope you weren’t depending on it for anything.” He chuckled. “Just kindling,” my neighbor said. “My wood’s all in.” “That’s right,” Dr.Rahim said. “I remember Duncan used to talk about how his family heated with wood. I was always a little envious. To me it seemed quite adventurous. But didn’t he say your house burned down? Or someone’s house? Before he was born?” “He was born,” I said. “I built that house,” my neighbor said. “Duncan was three when it happened,” I said. “Passive voice,” my neighbor said. “A hell of a thing to go through,” Dr.Rahim said. To my neighbor he said, “Until the stitches come out, your wife’s going to have to take care of your kindling.” “I’ll split his kindling for him,” I said. “But I’m not his wife.” My neighbor laughed. “Forgive me,” Dr.Rahim said. “There’s nothing to forgive,” I said. “Then I hope you won’t mind me saying it’s inspiring to see you two still have such a strong relationship, even after your divorce,” Dr.Rahim said. My neighbor and I stared at him. Divorce. What a powerful word. Listen, we were like any other family. After the house burned, we took words apart and when we put them back together our relationship had changed. Our relationship to the word house. To the word together, to the word live, the word son, neighbor, family, to the word because, the word before and the word after. Eventually we lived on opposite sides of the forest. We drew Duncan a map so he could travel between us. As soon as he could, he constructed a lean-to. Please, he said, consider me as you would any other neighbor. “Maybe this is too much information,” Dr.Rahim said. “But my wife and I are considering that right now. Conscious uncoupling.” It was too much information. We were simple people. The words we had already didn’t work and there was no indication that new ones with more syllables would work any better. “Please give Duncan my best,” Dr.Rahim said, depositing his latex gloves and his suturing materials into the biohazard container. I drove my neighbor and his rotten hand home. He wolfed a pill prescribed by Dr.Rahim. For once he didn’t speak. What was there to say? It’s hard to do what other people want you to do. It’s hard to give someone your best. It’s hard to give someone the best of what you have. It’s hard to live with someone and also love them. I can do hard things. I can say things like, How was your day, which is effusive enough for some people. I can even say, When do you think this cold snap will end, or, Hey are we doing Christmas this year, or no just skip it, either way is fine with me. But words have power and mine were never powerful enough. Or they were too powerful. Either one is the death of a marriage. Before the trees began, I steered the truck over the rise and dip of the railroad tracks, which made my neighbor curse. The striped gate was raised. The coal train was long gone. The animals hid in the dark of the forest, or they didn’t. When I gave him the hatchet, Duncan told me, You ignored what Dad did to me. You went along with it. Never once, he said. Never once did you stand up for me. But just because you don’t remember something doesn’t mean that it never happened. I do remember. Duncan was three. He was in the nap tent. He was meant to be napping. My husband had split and stacked two cords of wood. He’d told me which cord was seasoned and which cord was green. Burn the seasoned wood, he said. Let the green wood season, and I agreed. But in those days I had no relationship with the words cord, ash, hickory, oak, cherry, maple, let alone the word green or the word seasoned. To me those words were decoration, pleasant and folksy, with no real power. I must have been burning green wood all that winter, and into the spring. That day, after my husband went out, I packed the stove. While the creosote built and bubbled in the chimney, I made a list: Cat food\nLysol\nDish soap\nLaundry\nPropane\nDiapers I tried to remember what it took for me to get here and I wondered if I would ever leave. I burned with curiosity. After a while it became difficult to concentrate. I tried to stay curious, but my curiosity was interrupted by a noise. It was a noise that had been there all along. It was Duncan. Duncan screaming in the nap tent. Duncan growing claws. Duncan clawing to get out. Duncan speaking and speaking, speaking powerfully but without words. That time, I heard. I looked once more at my list. I opened the stove. I tossed my banal list inside and watched it burst. Then I undid the nap tent knot and I gathered my red and sweating boy, my panicked boy, my soiled boy. He doesn’t remember. He doesn’t remember that I stripped him of his diaper, and I cleaned him, and I changed him, and I wrapped him up and snugged him to my back. He doesn’t remember that we left. That we walked down the hill, out of the woods, that we came to the tracks and a train was passing. Dog, Duncan said. Dog. I watched a hopper car, a hopper car, a hopper car, then a boxcar. The train slowed so that we could walk alongside it. I climbed with Duncan into the boxcar and the boxcar picked up speed. We were leaving, we were leaving, and with that wonder inside me, I watched our forest stay behind. Cat, Duncan said, waving his hand, and there was a fox. The fox was trotting from the forest as if she had somewhere to go, but she stopped at the tracks. She waited for the train to pass, but the train lurched. Stopped. Started. Stopped again. The fox, waiting, spread her hind legs, put her ass down, and prepared to shit. Poo, Duncan cried, and the fox looked up and saw us. The fox saw us see her shitting. I saw her see us see her. She flattened her ears. The way she looked at us, angry, embarrassed, shocked, we knew it was wrong that we watched her deposit her black logs packed with feathers and bones, insects and fruit and seeds. High above her a column of black smoke plumed over the trees. I may have no respect for anything, even the universe, but for twenty years I have wondered and wondered how one thing leads to another. I have wondered where my story begins. The fox is where I return. Everyone knows that if by some misfortune you see a dog shitting, you should hook your index fingers together or else there will be a consequence. Some say a wart will sprout. Some say it will be worse. But a fox is not a dog. A fox is not a cat. Should we have hooked our fingers? Duncan’s fingers were too small, and mine were wrapped around my baby boy. The fox shit and then she dashed up the bank into the woods. The trees stood still. The boxcar stood still. Away down the tracks, I could still see the striped gate, beyond it our path home. We hadn’t made it very far. The train didn’t move. The temperature dropped. The sun went down. The wind picked up. Duncan said to me, Hungry. The boxcar said to me, Are you actually leaving? Do you know where you’re going? Do you know what you’ll do once you get there? Do you even have a map? I smelled the smoke. I burned with curiosity. But curiosity is something quite apart from the desire to know. All I want is for you to be happy, I whispered to Duncan as I carried him back up the hill, toward the smoke and the man who would be my neighbor. My boy slept against me heavy as a river rock. I told him to be happy, but what did that mean? Only that amid the terror of such attachment, words don’t work. Now Duncan is out there somewhere, another happiness-pursuer, another person who may believe he deserves something, anything besides blame. For that and for nothing else I will apologize. I parked the truck at the edge of the forest. I put the emergency brake on. I chocked the wheel. I helped my helpless neighbor out onto the forest floor. He used his good hand to switch on his headlamp and we wound through the trees we had marked with orange blazes to define a home. My woman axe waited faithfully against the ash I had felled and bucked into rounds and wheelbarrowed to the chopping block so that the cat could piss on it, so that the urine could turn to crystals, which after long-term exposure can be mysteriously bad for your health. This is the type of causality you can watch. You can see it crystallizing. You may forget about it, but years later Dr.Rahim, or some other doctor who was a baby when your baby was a baby but who is now the one you trust your only body to, will look at you and break the bad news. The cat slunk from the hut I built of particleboard and Tyvek near the burned-out foundation. Needily, she butted against my neighbor, who kicked her toward me. She put her rough tongue to my torn undergarment, curious. My neighbor’s beam caught the map in the ash. “Spalting,” he said. “Spalting?” “Those blue lines in the ash,” he said. “Spalting. It’s a process by which hard wood is eaten by fungi, requiring nitrogen, micronutrients, water, warmth, and air. It compromises the grain of the wood, but it’s much sought-after by woodworkers, not for structure but for beauty.” “And for firewood,” I said. “You wouldn’t catch me burning wood eaten up by fungus,” he said. “To me, it looks like a map,” I said. My neighbor bent closer, his thumb hovering upward. “You’re right,” he said. “It does look like a map.” What was I to do? And don’t say be softened by the first words of affirmation he’d said to me in twenty years. Don’t say invite him in. What looked like a map was not a map. What looked like a map was spalting, which is a word like sparrow, like salt, like salary. Just a word that could be grown over and enveloped, repurposed and subsumed like all the others. “Do you need help with your fire?” I asked. “I’ll manage,” he said. “Are you happy?” I asked. “I mean, living the way we do?” “I’m not the happiness type,” he said. On that single affinity we had built a life.

        "story": "April said that when she got healthy—if she did, she said, if—she wanted to have Julia’s body. It was the ideal, April said, curvy but still thin enough, I should know from that time I had to draw you. She had leaned over Julia and traced her outline. It was one of the activities, along with closing your eyes and picking your anchor, the place where you can go in your mind when you get triggered. For Julia this was a place in Maine, on a lake cliffed by rocks, where her grandparents had once owned a home. Each day Julia watched for the postman to deliver the mail, his hand on the outboard motor steering him toward the dock. April hovered over Julia, who lay prone on the large strip of yellow paper, and Julia felt April’s empty rotten breath on her face, breath that has only breathed and tasted its own breath. The pencil moved along her sides. When it had traced her entirety, Julia rose to standing. April’s outlines were shaky outlines. April shook, always. The outline revealed itself to be far smaller than Julia had expected. As was the hope; the point of the exercise was to reveal the women’s body dysmorphia. Other than being young, Julia was no different. Now, the art therapist said, let’s color us in. Here is: magazines sparkles paint crayons buttons charcoal cotton balls. Now: one side is your good side, the front; this is your best self. This is your body. What do you think of it? What does it look like? Bright colors for your good self: white buttons sparkles sugar spice glitter good things good good girl things. On the back, where our negative feelings lie: newsprint black X’s Band-Aids pencil shavings magazine photographs of women’s bodies heads ripped off all our self-loathing. Julia cried when April said that about her body. She had held her hands to her face and cried because just then she realized that they all—Ariel and Sally and April—saw her as the Other, as the fat one. She wished she’d been anorexic, in control, clean, dry, baby-powder fresh. She cried for what they thought of her and for what she thought of herself. When the women were recovered or their insurance ran out, they left. And new women replaced them. One particular replacement who would stay with Julia long after she’d left the ward herself was a woman who came in late at night. It was as if she’d been dragged in. She was not in her right mind. Perhaps she’d been drinking or had taken drugs. Julia was interested in her because, although she was older than Julia—all the women were; her position as the youngest had somehow become important to her, vital even—still this woman was cool, the way Julia saw cool, and no one else on the ward was cool to Julia. The woman wore combat boots and her hair was dyed black and she had several safety pins in her ears, a leather jacket, broken in. She sat down in the lounge and held court. Bulimic, she said, running her hand across her chest, gesturing toward an invisible sign. Favorite food is ice cream because you get to taste it twice. She stomped her feet. Several hours later, in the middle of the night, this girl screamed out in pain. A caffeine headache, they were told the next morning. The story went that even though there was no caffeine allowed, they had a Coke brought in for her, to ease her off it. She had been forced to choose between a regular Coke and the headache, because they wouldn’t give her Diet. The story went that she had given the nurses the finger and refused the Coke. That was the news that traveled through the ward at breakfast, where the bulimics could barely hear for the horrible sound of their mastication, and the anorexics couldn’t listen, so focused were they on their fear. But Julia heard it, through her own chewing, and subsequently she would try to model herself after this girl. She wanted to be able to go against something. Anything. She feared her disease was a disease of complicity. She would become hard and she would change many times and then one day she would soften, but not until she had a child and she had been disarmed and forced into the care of another. A child would soften her. Loving animals would also soften her but not like a child would. On the ward Julia was not yet tough and not yet soft because she was not yet formed. She did not yet know, for example, what it meant on those nights when she would hear the moans of the women on the ward making love to one another. She did not know there was pleasure to be found there. Often the moans of satisfaction around her were what woke her from her dreams of fishermen. Her psychiatrist was named Dr. Fisher. Julia’s main complaint to him was how she still had to do her homework while on the ward. She was reading Hamlet; she had to call her teachers to discuss the play. Which she did, in the little cluttered office saved for nurses. It was unfair, the psychiatrist agreed. Getting healthy takes time. Dr. Fisher was short and fat and redheaded and what Julia would remember most about him was the way fishermen appeared in so many of her dreams. The drawings they did on the ward were meant as keepsakes, evidence. Discharged in time to apply to college, as her parents had insisted, Julia would bring hers home and secure it with gray putty to the back of her closet. It would hang there as evidence, even when she left for college five months later and turned to more socially acceptable forms of obliteration. Her mother cleared out most of the other things in that closet—a cut-up soccer sweatshirt, lace-up Joan & David leather boots, a field hockey stick, a yellow lion won at Kings Dominion—all to the Goodwill. She left the drawing of her daughter’s body though. She was afraid to touch it. Other items replaced what had been Julia’s—her dead grandmother’s silver, bulging scrapbooks, hanging closets within the closet filled with mothballs—and Julia only sees the drawing years later when she returns. She is with her child. Her husband will no longer join her on these holiday trips to her parents’ house because she is divorced now. Nothing was enough for her, he said. She was never satisfied. They even quarreled on their honeymoon. This was in Paris, a city so beautiful she had felt she was always in the wrong place, that she should be eating elsewhere, walking elsewhere, seeing something better than whatever was before her. Also, she had wanted the baby with such fervency she could see little else. She had stopped at nothing. Marriage was one of life’s innumerable expectations that would teach her how nothing is behind a person. As she trudges up the attic stairs—she grew up in the attic, smoking at the window seat for most of her young adulthood—she is out of breath, even though she has remained fit all these years, has not let herself go, never given in because that, she knows, would be the straw that breaks it. She feels it sometimes, the way she can’t stop with the cookies and sometimes the ice cream that her husband would keep in the house and then scold her for eating when he found the pint empty. I wonder why you chose him, Dr.Fisher might once have said. What do you think that’s about? On docks or boats or in huts on frozen lakes, there were so many fishermen in her dreams then. Her husband did not have a name she could dream into. That faraway time when Julia was on the ward was as distant to her husband as his first love, his first kiss, and so, he thought, should that time be for her. Julia never found the words to tell him that his were such sweet things. Such sweet memories. All beginnings. Winded, she reaches her room in the attic and as she opens the door to hang the dress she intends to wear for the new memory she has returned to her childhood home to make, she sees it: the young shape of her body folded in half, bowing to the weight of its own pins and buttons and burnt matches. It is impossible not to remember, not to be that girl again, the youngest girl in a room full of women—the discharges and the admitted, where are they? Where is April? Once not long ago, Julia saw a woman on the street with black stringy hair and steel-toed boots and a ripped biker jacket—but of course, she realized, that could be any young woman, and the woman Julia searched for, were she alive, would be middle-aged by now. Here is the evidence: April’s shaky drawing, her worst self bowed toward her. What would it be like to stop wanting, Julia wonders in much the same way she wondered then. To just be able to eat it and see it and spend it and keep it and fuck it and love it. What she had done to herself as a teenager was a way around this issue, she knows. To have what she wanted and rid herself of it. It is impossible to shake that. Want is deep and big and horrible and it cannot be chased down. She wonders, shutting the closet door, as she had wondered on the ward of grim women, how she would ever manage to keep it all down, to keep it all in. Of course, that had not been want. None of this is want. She hadn’t wanted any of it. Where, Julia wonders, is her heart’s desire.

        "story": "In an effort to replenish its anemic membership with younger blood, the New Amsterdam Club has, among other measures, relaxed its dress code, allowed the use of cell phones, and added a mezcal cocktail to the menu. Yet one unspoken rule remains unchallenged: no business talk on the premises. Unless, maybe, in what’s known as “the little bar.” No one would dream of discussing work in the big bar or the dining room, but the little bar is a territory with a diplomatic status and a legislation of its own. Conversations are kept brief and drinks left unfinished out of consideration for those who pretend not to be waiting outside: according to yet another tacit law, each party is given total privacy in the narrow, seatless bar. Perhaps because its regulars don’t tend to be among the club’s most aesthetically minded members, the issue with the Sargent hanging in a dusky corner by the little bar’s entrance wasn’t immediately noticed. In 1885, John Singer Sargent painted a portrait of his friend Martin Graham, a minor watercolorist with whom he traveled Scotland that summer. It may have been as an homage to Graham that the oil on Sargent’s brush becomes less viscous toward the painting’s edges. Light strokes, faded colors, and dissolving shapes merge into one another, somewhat resembling a watercolor—a medium that Sargent, of course, also mastered. The subtlety of this conversation between friends through different materials and forms was utterly lost in the pixelated reproduction of the portrait that had been printed on canvas and mounted in a frame that closely resembled the real thing. Eventually someone noticed the crude forgery, but no one could say how long the original had been gone. Like the New Amsterdam Club, the Spanish Association is grand and underattended. Unlike the club, however, the association is overendowed. At the dawn of the twentieth century, Charles Dunlap was caught up in the “Spanish craze” that swept the United States. But for him the fad developed into a lifelong obsession. Without making a significant dent in the shipping fortune inherited from his father, he bought almost two millenniums’ worth of Spanish history—from Roman artifacts, Nasrid textiles, and Hebrew Bibles to paintings by El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya—and erected an imposing building on West 152nd Street to house his collection. For the rest of the country, the Iberian fervor turned out to be briefer than a snap of castanets, and interest in Dunlap’s objects faded soon after his early death. Nevertheless, the association endured, embalmed in money. With virtually unlimited funding, it has never needed to attract the general public or high-profile donors. Its mere existence is the only condition for its continued existence. The few scholars who regularly consult the archives have long ago stopped looking at the masterpieces in the galleries leading to the library. This is why it wasn’t immediately obvious that Zurbarán’s still life Quince, Apple, and Lemon had been replaced with a printout. In this case, however, it wasn’t a reproduction of the painting but a photo of an actual quince, an actual apple, and an actual lemon, eclipsing one another in orbiting chiaroscuros, very much in the same way Francisco de Zurbarán had laid out and painted the fruit he had gathered from an Andalusian orchard. Academics and conceptual artists quivered with excitement after the news broke—referent, context, appropriation, etc. The police didn’t immediately connect the Zurbarán to the Sargent. No one could establish when the still life had been stolen (or “improved,” according to a wisecracking criticaster), but the forgery was discovered toward the end of the American Booksellers’ Conference, held every fall in New York City. The main extracurricular event of the ABC has always been the party at the offices of the Parallel Press. It is widely accepted that editorial audacity and exquisite taste have kept the publishing house a bastion of literary prestige for over half a century, even if its halo of almost religious mystique has lately faded a bit. Overcrowded, sweaty, and often smelling of autumnally damp wool, the Parallel parties were unintentionally glamorous. There was something quaint about those evenings, with their indoor smoking and lighthearted, unconcealed bumps of cocaine in the kitchen. It was loud; everyone yelled; nobody cared. The books lining the walls were pushed back on their shelves to make room for plastic cups with bourbon or generic Côtes du Rhône. The autographed first editions and galleys marked up by prominent authors were kept in a locked room. But all the art—the pieces that the late Mindy Hall, the press’s founder and first publisher, had received or bought from her artist friends throughout her life—remained on display. Or, as it turned out during this year’s party, not quite all the art. Because the first thing Matthew Robbins, Hall’s successor, noticed the following morning as the cleaning crew stuffed Solo cups into garbage bags was that the relatively small Twombly above the bricked-up fireplace had been substituted with a fake. Instead of Cy Twombly’s traces, which had tended toward meaning while calmly refusing to become writing, there were now grotesque doodles. This caricature of the original, taped to the frame, had been executed in quick puerile strokes, using the box of twelve Crayola crayons left on the mantel—most likely as a provocation, according to Robbins’s press release. The police are now treating the three incidents in connection with one another, but they seem uninterested in the increasingly personal, essayistic nature of the forgeries, which is all the press and the art world are talking about. Walter Benjamin, Elizabeth Harland, William Gaddis, Patricia Highsmith, Orson Welles, and Jean Baudrillard are referenced in articles that take these thefts as an opportunity to reflect, always with a touch of irony, on the true meaning of aesthetic value. Two famous critics published pieces on the affair, swapping their signatures, columns, and writing styles. Commentators pored over an elaborate manifesto that someone claiming to be the perpetrator posted online, though it turned out to be the work of a graduate student in Ann Arbor, who plans to include it (and the whole scandal) in her doctoral dissertation. While theories proliferate, the detectives on the case remain unmoved. Given the almost complete lack of security at all scenes, they say, any amateur could have pulled off these stunts. Neither the officers half-heartedly investigating the case nor the intellectual pranksters are entirely wrong. © Srijon Chowdhury. Courtesy Foxy Production, New York City The Sargent was stolen because it was easy to steal. Michael Lyles is a second-generation member of the New Amsterdam, which at first made it hard for him to accept that he would soon have to leave the club. After years of diligent, misdirected work and enthusiastic, ill-advised investments, Michael had finally wiped out his inheritance. Someone had once remarked that his adult life could be summarized in three sartorial incarnations: if at the auspicious beginnings of his career he favored spread-collar shirts and double Windsor knots, at the moderate height of his success he cultivated the meticulous shabbiness that was the ultimate token of affluence in the new circles in which he traveled, although as his business declined and he began frequenting people younger than him, he developed a taste for designers from Antwerp and limited-edition sneakers, which he proudly started wearing at the New Amsterdam when this was still somewhat of a provocation. That he had never evolved beyond this last stage probably indicated that his professional life was stagnant. There was, however, more objective evidence of this standstill: the point had come when he could no longer afford to have guests over at the club, and he well knew that the looming annual dues would be beyond his reach. He ended up concluding that it was all for the best. Who wanted to be around dinosaurs and parvenus anyway? His newly acquired disdain for the club was, in fact, what made him consider the Sargent. Michael had never cared for art, and he understood that if Sargent’s reputation had managed to get through his impermeable disinterest, the portrait hanging by the little bar must be worth something—an intuition he later confirmed by looking up other works by this artist on Christie’s and Sotheby’s. Black-market prices would be significantly lower, but he might still get enough for the painting to appease his more aggressive creditors. Even Michael could see how insulting his printout was to Sargent’s original. But he was rather proud of the replica a young couple at a shop upstate had made of the ebony ripple frame in the seventeenth-century Dutch style, which is how they described it when they saw the photographs Michael showed them on his phone. He mounted the picture himself, and the final result was passable enough, though it didn’t really matter. It only had to hold up for the few hours between his departure and the club’s closure that night—anything beyond would be a gift. The painting was small (roughly 17 by 15 inches) and could easily be carried in an inconspicuous bag. Having had countless failed business meetings in the little bar, Michael knew which nights were slow, when patrons dwindled away, and what the view was from every angle of the room. His hands were shaking as he removed the portrait, although he was sure he had nothing to worry about. Because the art world was absolutely foreign to him, Michael resorted to an ex-girlfriend who had gone, in her own words, from failed photographer to successful-enough gallerist. Marianne Simpson was talented at almost anything she set her mind to. In college, cognitive neuroscience, German studies, applied mathematics, and architecture seemed equally viable options. All possibilities were open—which, in the end, filled her with a paradoxical sense of claustrophobia. Her restless intellect found peace in concrete objects, and to the dismay of her advisers she concentrated on art. She started out as a sculptor with an interest in strict literality. Her pieces were realist to the point of intentional redundancy. She took countless photos in preparation for these sculptures, until she realized that everything she wanted was all there, in the pictures, and that any further steps were unnecessary. None of her teachers or friends denied the rigor and quality of her work, but for the first time she could sense everyone doubting her talent. This doubt became her ultimate motivation. The critics dismissed her first major show of photographic still lifes, but she survived the blow and stayed the course for as long as she could. As grants and funding became scarcer, she took a few graphic design jobs and then, tired of working for others, opened a gallery on the Lower East Side. Photography faded away. It was Marianne whose wit had reduced Michael’s adult life to those three stages of attire. She had met him right before he gave up spread collars and silk ties for frayed button-downs and merino cardigans, and she had initially thought herself responsible for this transition. One of their first fights (their relationship was based on conflict; they only truly met in battle) was over his “fascistoid” outfits, which she took as acts of aggression and her friends found hilarious. A gradual change followed that skirmish, and when Michael started showing up in corduroy and tattered tweeds, she believed she had won the war. Shortly thereafter he introduced her to his new acquaintances—all wearing some version of that shabby uniform—and she understood he was a chameleon with no taste of his own. She never brought it up, but this was a not minor cause leading to their breakup a few months later. Meeting him again after so many years, in his outmoded Belgian avant-garde costume, she deduced that he must have left his previous scene for a younger set. Marianne also deduced immediately that the painting was stolen, despite Michael’s protestations and a convoluted story involving friends of friends of friends. She wanted nothing to do with the transaction, but she did know a shady dealer who could help. All she asked in return was that he tell her the truth about the Sargent. After a long preface describing his fall and the extent of his despair, Michael told Marianne how he had pulled off the theft. (For moral context, he described the decline of the club and even managed to mention his once-scandalous sneakers in the process.) She was far more interested in the logistical details than in her friend’s woes—or even in the prize itself, which lay neglected on the sofa until Michael, having been promised an introduction to the dealer, wrapped it up and left. As she listened to Michael’s story, Marianne felt “time twisting into a helix,” as she would later put it. She remembered preparing for her first important show of photographic still lifes years before. She remembered the unattended Zurbarán at the Spanish Association, how much she had loved the painting, how closely she had studied it looking for inspiration for her own work, how indifferent the few others who passed it seemed to be. She also remembered the reviews of her last show (“accomplished yet ultimately irrelevant exercises in referential accuracy,” according to Art Agora). By looking back she found herself looking into the future: her memories morphed into a flawless scheme. She would re-create the still life (Quince, Apple, and Lemon) in real life, take a picture that not only reproduced the original with absolute precision but also captured its feeling—a photograph of Zurbarán’s gaze rather than merely one of the fruit—and replace the painting with the photo. Then she would wait to get caught. Of course, she wouldn’t be so inelegant as to plant clues for ham-fisted detectives; someone in the art community would have to recognize her style. Her photograph would be up at the Spanish Association for weeks or, with some luck, months before anyone realized that art was imitating art imitating nature. Eventually a colleague or a critic would think of her work. When the police came knocking at her door, she would return the Zurbarán at once, explaining how the whole thing had obviously been a conceptual art project. She would be let off with a slap on the wrist—or, worst-case scenario, a short sentence at a low-security prison, which would only cement her reputation as a provocateur. But it was also possible that no one would ever find her out. And if, after a year or two, nobody came for her and the case went cold, well, then she would own a Zurbarán. She couldn’t lose. After so many years devoted exclusively to her gallery, Marianne had forgotten how much she enjoyed taking photographs. She understood that her real piece was the entire “event”—the photo replacing the painting, the discovery of her scheme, the coverage in the specialized press—but she took enormous pleasure in the shoot. Once she felt certain that she would be able to re-create the painting, she reached out to the shady dealer. With his slick hair, whitened teeth, and radiant skin, Brett was ubiquitous in the art world. He wasn’t a close friend, but Marianne knew she could count on his greed. Among his legitimate clients were hedge fund managers, oilmen, and oligarchs—but the real money, people said, was in his murky operations, regarding which everyone claimed to have heard a wild story. Brett never cared to deny this gossip, and Marianne was convinced he loved the outlandish rumors about himself, not only because he was vain but also because there is no better hiding place than hyperbole. Still, she knew from reliable sources that he was effective at laundering the reputation of purloined paintings, negotiating with insurance companies, and acting as the middleman for pieces stolen on commission. She also knew that many of his deals didn’t revolve around cash at all. The art was sometimes used as collateral in much larger transactions or as a political bargaining chip, all of which she found quite frightening. This is why she intended to keep their meeting—at the McDonald’s on Third Avenue at 58th Street, per his instructions—brief. She arrived early, but Brett was already there, having a soda and neglecting his fries. He was wearing gym clothes, a Lakers hat, and a watch the size of a McMuffin. After the usual pleasantries, she put her proposition bluntly: If he could find someone to execute a foolproof plan to steal a Zurbarán (it was unguarded; it would be replaced with a fake; months would go by until anyone noticed it was missing), she would pay him with a Sargent he could get for a song from a friend of hers. She knew that these two artists, although vastly different in almost every regard, had a similar market and a comparable price point, so it would be a fair transaction. Brett responded exactly how she had anticipated: Yes, those artists were more or less equivalent in a commercial sense, but why should he run all the risks and also foot the bill, however ludicrous, for the Sargent? Marianne had an answer ready: She could compensate for all that with a Twombly. A minor Twombly, perhaps, but surely enough to bridge the gap. When Brett tried to negotiate further, she said they both knew that while it was impossible to sell a painting stolen from a museum, like the Zurbarán, it ought to be fairly easy for him to place two pictures from private collections. After seeing photos of both the Sargent and the Twombly—and discussing all the steps and the timeline—Brett agreed. I hadn’t spoken with Marianne in over a year when she called, but no matter how long we go without talking, there’s always an immediate feeling of closeness when we reconnect. We first met some eight years ago, working at the Parallel Press while trying to get our careers going—she as an artist, I as a novelist. The desk that I shared with another copy editor was right beside the art department, where she drafted bold cover designs that were almost always rejected for blander options. It didn’t take long for us to become friends: Marianne introduced me to her favorite artists; I lent her my favorite books. Despite my yearnings, which I quickly learned to repress, I knew nothing was possible beyond our instantaneously profound friendship. This is why I didn’t hesitate when Marianne told me about her project and asked me to get the Twombly for her. Especially when she got to the part with the crayons. The details of the execution can interest no one—they involve remaining hidden in a bathroom after all the ABC guests had left, taking the Twombly from its frame and replacing it with a fake, returning to the bathroom until the morning, and finally walking out, thinly disguised, with a garbage bag, among the cleaning crew I had hired. Of course, we could easily have managed a better forgery—or at least a printout of the original, as with the Sargent. But it had to be crude. And it was all about the box of crayons. The perceived provocation and the hurried nature of the copy were of the essence: Matthew needed to believe that both the theft and the forgery had taken place during his party. This would lead him to the conclusion that several perpetrators must have been involved. Among his guests there had to have been a group of conspirators making a circle around the painting or distracting his attention in some way as the original was replaced with the doodles someone had made right there, on-site, while laughing at him. And he did believe this to be the case: He had invited a bunch of vipers into his office, only to be ridiculed. I copyedited the press release where this was implied. I heard him, through the walls, yelling unfounded accusations into his phone. I was forwarded some of his irate, threatening emails from the people who received them—all wondering whether Matthew had utterly lost his mind. Aside from the outbursts of rage, life at the office has grown rather quiet. All those futile, flamboyant projects have come to a halt. There are no more lunches. No jokes. Matthew distrusts all those who attended his party—which is essentially everyone in the book business. He has become the subject of widespread mockery and the butt of every joke in the literary world. It’s said that the board of directors will summon him any day now. Meanwhile, he remains obsessed with the theft and keeps focusing on small, trivial matters. A moment ago, he told me to find him a few posters and arrange them in a display so he could select one to cover up the pale rectangle where the Twombly once hung.

        "story": "Some of the guys joined back up for Korea, to be Marines once more, to sail back across the Pacific Ocean and kill different Asians. Bob considered the prospect, but then Kirkland got stabbed pretty bad in a fight up in Eugene and didn’t get out of the hospital until a lung specialist had operated on him four times. Bob, Butch, and Hal left him, riding on to Reno, where Hal took up with a waitress who was just two weeks short of being an ex-wife with four kids. After washing dishes at the Mapes Hotel and casino and stashing the bank, Bob and Butch rode south. They met up with some other guys—also former Marines—had some great days, got in trouble here and there, and moved on. In ’56 there was a big set-to in Needles. Some of the organized gangs were staking their turf, so it was not unusual to read headlines about war between rival biker gangs! When those power plays progressed from busted-bone fights to lethal shootouts, Butch seemed to come alive again, but Bob wanted no part of more brushes with the law and moved along, pronto. Good thing, as two highway patrolmen were shot dead in Riverside by some idiot on a Harley-Davidson. Ever since, anyone on motorcycle was a possible suspect. By 1958, Bob Falls was riding solo and drinking more than was good for him. He wrecked his motorcycle in Indio, fracturing his hip in the accident. His stride had a hitch in it after that, and he got a former police model Harley-Davidson Panhead cheap at an auction because its front fork had been damaged. He heard about a job in Gallup—something to do with a roofing company owned by a vet. Steady bank would not be a bad thing and he’d always liked New Mexico, so he decided to head that way. But he never got around to leaving the confines of Flagstaff. He took up with some guys at a place called the Fireside Lounge who all had regular jobs and would spring for endless pitchers of Hamm’s Golden Draft, so the folding money in Bob’s jeans (and the wad he kept in his boot) was rarely touched. One night, some cops walked into the lounge because a cab driver complained that someone inside had stiffed him. Bob slipped out, expertly, slept the night behind a Seventh-day Adventist church, and by 7am was sitting in a coffee shop, finishing his eggs, ketchup-smothered hash browns, and cinnamon toast before finally riding east on the 66 to Gallup, figuring to stop only for tanks of gas, a few cold beers, and the time it took to piss. The coffee shop was a modern place—red vinyl booths, each with a jukebox the size of a cookie jar—and the breakfast rush was in mid-swing. Bob sat alone at the counter, displaying a countenance that made other customers naturally leave an empty seat on either side of him. His waitress was old enough to be his mother, a woman serving this red-eyed hoodlum in the hope that he might tip her a dime. Or that if she served him enough coffee, he might stop smelling of beer. There was a sudden clatter in one of the booths. Every head in the place looked over to see a family—wife, husband, grandma, and three kids—suffering a spilled milkshake, which spread across their table in a frothy tide and dripped into a puddle on the floor. “Now I won’t get any!” cried the oldest kid, a boy not yet ten. A toddler stood on the seat beside him, laughing, while a quiet little girl—the middle child—sucked on her fingers. “Sure you will, Tiger,” the father said. When a Mexican busboy came over with rags to sop up the mess, the dad took over to let him get a mop. “We’ll take another malted,” he called out, knowing he’d be heard. “And three straws?” “She knocked it over,” the boy whined, pointing at his sister. “Every day an adventure,” the father said in an upper register to the coffee shop. He brought the dripping rags to the waitress at the counter, a seat away from where Bob, food done, had pushed off his plate to Zippo one of his remaining Chesterfield Kings. The dad gave Bob a smile and a nod—the men were about the same age, if not the same station. His wink said, If you want three kids, take mine. “Hey, could you spare a nail?” Bob tapped out a cigarette and flicked his Zippo. “Little early for milkshakes, isn’t it?” No reason not to be friendly. “Been driving since oh-four-hundred. This is lunchtime for us.” Dad exhaled a lung full of smoke. “Vernon Cloud.” No hand offered, just the name. Likewise, “Bob Falls.” Vernon showed his lit cigarette to his wife, a universal gesture: Permission to smoke, honey? Honey nodded with a slight eye roll just as the waitress delivered the replacement shake with three straws. “Vacation with the brood?” Bob asked, after a nod to his waitress for a refill of coffee and a fresh cup for Vernon Cloud. “Promised the kids Disneyland, so we’re going to make a week of it. Going to the whale show at Marineland, too. Swore I’d never see California again after the service. Was so happy to be home in one piece that I wouldn’t have left Wichita for Marilyn Monroe. Now I’m driving to see Mickey Mouse and Bubbles the Whale and get back before school starts. You don’t have any kids, do you?” Bob shook his head. “How’d you manage that?” Okay, Bob said to himself. This fellow needs to talk to another man. He’s been cooped up in a car with his kids and his women for a very long stretch of Route66. Bob decided to throw the domesticated dog a bone. “Well, none that I know of.” Vernon Cloud laughed like he needed the release. “Good to meet a fellow Marine. I noticed the globe and anchor on your flame.” Vernon meant Bob’s Zippo, which was also embossed with the word tarawa. For fifteen years now the lingua franca among men Vernon’s age—strangers, pals, business acquaintances, anyone who’d been in high school in 1941—was war talk. If you were able-bodied and about thirty-five, the war was how you reached common ground, began a relationship, or just blew time waiting in line at the post office. Vernon took a drag and let it out with the style of a former smoker who missed the effect. “I was in the First. Out of Oceanside.” “I heard of you guys,” Bob told him. “I was in the Fifth.” Adding Oceanside was not necessary. “Hell of an outfit.” Vernon let out a cloud of smoke. “Tarawa, eh?” “Among other garden spots.” “God must have looked out for us. When Peleliu settled down they took away my M1 and gave me a movie projector. Can you believe that? I showed the movies every night. Ask me about For Whom the Bell Tolls. I can recite every line. Tell me my wife isn’t a look-alike for Ingrid Bergman.” Bob checked—there was no resemblance. Same bony shoulders and the nose, maybe. “Yeah, God was steering my rudder,” Vernon said. “You land at Saipan?” “Yep.” Bob left it at that and drank his coffee. “Okinawa,” Vernon said about his own deployment, adding cream and two sugars to his coffee. “Guessing that’s your motorcycle out front?” he asked, not wanting to give up a few moments of conversation away from his family. “It is.” “Travel light, do you?” “For the open road. And maybe the lamentations of those in authority.” Vernon laughed. “I get it, brother. You and I were kids when they gave us our toys and shipped us off. A few years later, they give us back our civvies and say, ‘Home you go.’” Vernon glanced over to his non-Bergmanish wife, who was showing their youngest the “here is the church, here is the steeple” game with her hands. “Bob, do you have time for a little story?” How many times—in a bar, in a coffee shop, during a card game, on a job, in the drunk tank—had Bob been asked whether he wanted to hear a little story? A buddy got killed. A bullet just missed. A ship sank. The next plane disappeared in a ball of fire. A hungry girl gave a blow job for a Kration. A mangy dog just needed some scratching. An officer gave an imbecilic order that got a bunch of good men killed—no, wait, he ignored an imbecilic order, turned the tide, and that’s why I’m here talking to you today! Bob had heard these stories for years, and he’d never once started the conversation. “Isn’t Bubbles the Whale waiting?” “This will just take a minute.” Vernon Cloud was not to be stopped, not with this perfected act of his. He inched his body closer to Bob’s at the counter, leaning toward him in confidence. “A few years back, a fellow moved in to the house across the street. Owen Schmidt. Nice guy. Two little kids. His wife is friends with mine. He’s a CPA and tax guy. We give each other the wave, you know, when we see each other, but we aren’t pals. I’m a talkative guy, he’s not. Okay. To each his own, right?” Bob nodded. “You ever wake up at night, Bob? Like I do? I wake up with real bad dreams where nothing goes right. Can’t load my ammo clip. The breech of my M1 is jammed. I keep dropping everything. I can’t climb out of my foxhole and I hear the Tojos coming for me. I’m yelling in my sleep. I kick Linda. I get twisted in the sheets and feel like I’m trapped.” Bob did that. All the guys did that, kicking a wife or not. “All I can do is get up right out of bed and go turn on a light in the front room and ride it out. Used to have a beer, work a crossword puzzle. Smoke half a pack.” Vernon nodded at his Chesterfield. “Now one of the TV channels is on all night so I watch a movie with the sound on real low. This has been going on since, you know, V-J Day. When Owen moved in across the street, I start noticing that on some of those nights? After I have those dreams? A light comes on in his front room, too. Not every time, but many is the night when he’s up, I’m up, and both of us have been yelling in our sleep. Kicking our wives.” “This Owen a Marine?” Bob asked. “Army intelligence. In the ETO because he spoke German. Schmidt. His grandfolks had come over, so he grew up talking it. Never saw combat. I found that out one night, three in the morning. I’m watching the Late Late Late Show and I see his light come on. Then I see his front door open. I see him walk out into the middle of our street. And he looks up at the sky. I grab a couple of beers and, why not? Go out and join him. He doesn’t take the beer but we start talking, there in our pajamas. He points out some of the stars and the planet Mars. I don’t know anything astronomical, so seeing Mars was something else. Well, what do you know? Mars, I say. ‘Haunting us, chasing after us,’ Owen says. Who? ‘Mars. The god of war.’” Here it comes, Bob told himself. “We got to talking.” Vernon paused, inhaling the last of the Chesterfield into his body. He blew out a long stream of blue-gray smoke and ground the butt out in an ashtray on the counter. Then he spoke very quietly under the din of dishes and forks and chatter and “Running Bear” by Johnny Preston playing on the jukebox. “Owen interrogated Nazis. Local officials, higher-ups, SS types. They’d be handcuffed to chairs. He’d cut off little bits of their ears. Not right away, but after a while, to get them to talk. After a few cuts, then a few more, then a few more, they’d be covered in their own blood and they’d start talking. Some of the officers, after they told everything they knew—he’d take them outside and shoot them in the back of the head. He’d dug a slit trench himself for them to fall into. Seventeen. He’d kept count. Seventeen. He shot seventeen Nazis in the back of their heads and no one said a word to him. ‘They were the bad guys,’ he said. Can you spare another?” Bob supplied his Zippo and one of his last two Chesterfields. Vernon drew down on the smoke like a thirsty man drinking from a cup of cool spring water. “On Peleliu, a lot of the Tojos were hiding in caves after the island was supposed to have been secured. They’d come out at night and kill Marines and desecrate the bodies. So we’d blow up the caves or burn ’em out, you know, with a flamethrower.” Bob knew all about that method of clearing out caves. He’d carried the M2 portable flamethrower on his twenty-year-old shoulders. He nodded and Vernon continued. “We’d go into the cave for the count, cut off one ear of each Japanese, dead or not yet dead. If the body had an ear missing, it’d been counted. I kept track. Eighty-eight ears came in, some I’d gotten myself. We’d string them up on a clothesline like my wife does with the kids’ wet socks. ‘They were the bad guys,’ I said. Owen, he looked at me and asked, ‘So, were we the good guys, then?’” Bob had heard this story before—but worse. Had he been so inclined, he could tell Vernon his stories. Stories that weren’t about chopped-off ears. Ears were nothing. “Owen and I started talking that very night about putting our past behind us. There we were—good jobs, kids to raise, women who loved us—still screaming at Mars in our sleep. We decided, Owen and I, that we needed something in our lives bigger than our two selves, something more powerful than winning the war. I’d like to share with you what we found.” Bob Falls did not want to hear any of what was going to come out of Vernon Cloud’s mouth next. Prophets, preachers, and witnesses had shown up in every dark place Bob Falls had landed in the past twelve years. He laughed at them, loathed them, ignored them; Cloud was just another one. But Vernon Cloud said nothing more. He reached into the breast pocket of his shirt, where a pair of sunglasses were folded along with what looked to be notepads but turned out to be slim pamphlets. “My name is on the back here,” Vernon said, showing Bob the business card he’d stapled to each pamphlet with his name, address, and phone number back in Wichita. He ground out the Chesterfield in the ashtray. “If you choose to read this and want to talk any, give me a call. Collect. I’ll be home next month. Thanks for being open with your time and smokes. Remember the Raleighs they’d give us on the front lines? Ghastly. Be good to yourself, Bob Falls.” He left the pamphlet faceup on the counter and returned to his family, who had finished their meal and replacement milkshake. Bob watched Vernon collect the kids and wife and granny and head to the cashier at the entrance. Ingrid Bergman gave Bob a nice smile. Vernon, a nod. Through the coffee shop window, Bob saw the Clouds climb into a yellow-and-white Studebaker Champion station wagon and pull out, bound west for a Magic Kingdom and Marineland. Bob held up the pamphlet, with its drawing of a movie-handsome Jesus Christ and the questions: do you know god loves you? would you like to know his plan for your life? Bob didn’t read the tract, but he did give it a quick flip-through: illustrations of sunbeams, crosses, and small churches filled with well-dressed white people, all smiling because God was planning their lives. On the second to last page Jesus was surrounded by a heavenly chorus. Opposite him was a bible verse written in florid script. Bob finished his coffee and left a half-dollar tip. Twenty dollars and change would get him to Gallup. He picked up the pamphlet and paid for his breakfast at the cashier. Before leaving, he hit the cigarette machine in the entryway. He put in a quarter, pulled the knob, and fished the Chesterfield Kings from the tray at the bottom, still holding the tract from Vernon Cloud. Beside the machine was a bulletin board covered with business cards, postcards with funny sayings, personal messages, and for sale offerings. He took a thumbtack from a lost puppy notice that was a month old. He let the card drop to the floor—either the pooch had been found by now or was living with a farmer up in the mountains, aka dead—and he used the tack to post Vernon’s pamphlet to the board. Someone was sure to be open to pondering His plan for their life, and the pamphlet would be theirs for the taking. Before he turned away, a note card caught Bob’s eye: dishwasher wanted\ngood$\ncall angel\nmesa 2-1414 He thought of the roofing job waiting in Gallup, where he’d be working outdoors in the sun, banging nails, lifting shingles or tile, hot-mopping tar. In New Mexico. He suddenly felt so very tired. Even the idea of the long ride on 66 caused a throb in his cracked hip. Something in his head said an indoor job might be a nice thing for a while. Dishwashers got free meals. Maybe that night he’d be back at the Fireside drinking from pitchers of Hamm’s bought by someone else. A local call cost a nickel. Bob closed the booth door behind him, cleeng-cleenged the Indian-head coin into the phone’s slot and roto-dialed 632-1414. The phone rang and rang, so many times that Bob muttered Jesus Christ and was about to hang up when a woman answered. “This is Angel,” she said.

        "story": "A departure yard in Chicago (detail), December 1942, by Jack Delano. Courtesy Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Leave the two men stranded along the railroad tracks outside Chicago, not far from Michigan City, Indiana, during what would eventually be called the Great Depression, hunched together down in the weeds, resting their feet, smoking and looking out at the lake, which that day was as gray and roiling as the clouds, driven by wind from the north. It was close to Christmas and winter seemed eager to arrive. One of them, the tall one, wore a massive oversize grenadier-style coat—a chinchilla of dark blue, double-breasted with a number of missing buttons. The other, the shorter one, named Buster, a ridiculously long leather mackinaw with moth-eaten shearling lining over an old cossack jacket he’d picked up at a charity shelter on the South Side earlier that fall. The tall one was named Zaccheus and had a nose that had been broken a couple of times. The first break came from sparring with a kid named Jackie. There’s supposed to be a diplomatic aspect to sparring, he explained to Buster. Out of respect, two training boxers approach each other carefully when they spar and take care to avoid injuries. Closer to a fight date, it might get rough. But this kid Jackie was new—just starting off—and new kids can be stupid dangerous. He had something to prove and Dee, my trainer, was off answering a phone call, otherwise he would’ve kept the kid under control. I went easy and told him to toss me everything he had, and that’s when he broke my nose. I mean this kid had been soaking his knuckles in brine to toughen them up—rumor had it that Jack Dempsey soaked his knuckles—and he landed one of those lucky flash punches, quicker than expected, and it broke my nose so that I had to reset it myself in the gym bathroom, he explained. The second time I got it broke was in a pro fight up in Buffalo during a blizzard when I had to fight this lunkhead calling himself Irish Jack who had arms as big as hams and tossed punches the way you throw meat off a wagon. The arena that night was short on coal and our gloves were like blocks of ice, he told Buster back when they were getting to know each other, sharing bottles and stories. Your namesake, the original Zaccheus, was this knobby, ugly little tax collector fuck who climbed up into a tree to watch Jesus do his thing. Instead of kicking his ass, Jesus called him down, took him under his wing, and defied common sense and all that, Buster explained one night. Admit that Zac’s situation is similar to your own. Try to avoid the particulars. Or remember the wrong particulars, if that helps. Giving up can be a way of giving in. Letting go can be a way of getting. Quitting a story is like filling an aching tooth. The one named Buster was hefting his coat up and working to tighten the rope he was using as a belt. His stomach was grumbling. He had been halfway through telling a story he’d begun a few miles back about a bum kid named Lockjaw who had saved a train from collision at State Line junction near Hammond, Indiana, not far from where they were standing. That’s how my uncle told it, he said. He worked the junction and was there to see it. To strand them standing there forever would be nothing short of catastrophic, you tell yourself. Both men are quitters, and both of them are resigned to fate. Zac quit before a pro fight at the Marigold Gardens, on the way to the ring. The tinny roar of the crowd and thick cigar smoke siphoned down the brick corridor. He was wearing his wife’s satin red robe as a getup, his boots laced tight, while his opponent that night, Rocking Rudy, strode ahead of him. On an impulse he’d never be able to explain to himself, he turned right instead of left, took the back exit into the parking lot, and walked away from the ring for the rest of his life. To quit the story would be to let Buster have the final word. Look, Zac, the way I see it, we’re inside this tyranny no matter what, he’d say, scratching a match on the side of a hot slag car, lighting his smoke before launching into his theory that to want to win anything—as bad as Zac had wanted to win that title—put you into a tyranny of expectation, the same expectation that you, Means, were feeling as you watched Zac turn to his friend and say, You’re full of shit, Buster, with all of your fancy words, and then you listened as Buster said, What words? And you heard Zac say, Tyranny is a bullshit, big shot word, and you watched as Buster shook his head and spit off to the side before explaining that one word wasn’t any more highfalutin than any other. (You struggled to catch the right tone, his learnedness combined with the lingo he had picked up from Zac, who had picked up his own way of talking during his years at the boxing gym, where every ten minutes his manager and mentor, Dee, would check his stopwatch and shout time in, meaning time to begin a round of exercise—working the table or shadowboxing—and then time out when three minutes were up, so that it was time in, time out, time in, time out, time in, time out as they worked through the stations day after day, a rhythm broken only when Dee came over to impart wisdom, saying, Lower that side of your shoulder and keep your guard up, or, The only way to win a fight is not to think about winning it, or, You gotta be where you’re at to get where you’re going, or, most famously, The only way to get the prize is to stop wanting the prize and let the prize be wanting not to have the prize in the first place.) You watched early in the fall as a cop, Sergeant Pulaski, picked up Zac on a charge of vagrancy and then, in a fit of kindness, offered to pay him a little bit to stand in a lineup, shoulder to shoulder with others of his likeness—tall men with gaunt weathered faces and droopy eyelids—not because he was accused of the crime but because he looked the part. I was put up before judgment for a crime I didn’t commit, knowing I didn’t commit it, and aware that I was there as a token of others who looked like the one who did commit it, he said as he and Buster trudged through East Chicago, past the rows of tenements, street vendors crowding the sidewalks, and then up the hill at Ninety-fifth Street and onto the tracks that led to the Iroquois steel mill where the Calumet River fed into the lake—you’d make note of that bridge, the shack with the tender—and then, as they walked, he began explaining to Buster how his father had worked in steel and could read a mill by the smoke, tell you what was being cooked, or not cooked, or if the thing was heating up or down just by the type of smoke that was or wasn’t coming out. You work to solidify Zac and Buster inside this landscape. You push them to get a handle on their own destinies and, hopefully, in doing so, to become major characters. You urge them to head to upper Michigan. You imagine creaking floorboards in the entry to a saloon on a snowy night. The icy shore of Little Traverse Bay in wan winter light. A mansion on a hill surrounded by a spikenard fence. Such are the images you see ahead for these two figures you’ve conjured out of the past, out of the dim darkness of memory, until you see, clearly, that on his own and without your help, Zac has become hell-bent on making it to Petoskey where, he claims, he has an uncle with a mansion and a fortune who will stake him a part of his coal company or his shipping business which you know—in your heart of hearts—is most likely a MacGuffin he’s created to get himself up there so he can find the mansion empty and boarded up, and then, on a binge, he’ll be swept off the stone pier during a storm because that point on the map is lodged inside his delusional memory, and all memory is delusion surrounded by need. Buster understands all this as he listens to Zac saying, We’ll go see my uncle up in Petoskey and leave this fair but brutal city behind. (Nelson Algren once wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post about the police: “He doesn’t know he’s healthy. He thinks he’s sick. And from this dangerous illusion his life is pervaded by a conviction that he is inferior. Between the image the world approves and the fantasy he indulges, he drives to the hour when the approval is made official by the badge on his breast; and immunity is granted him to indulge such fantasy. Now at last those who have made him toe the mark are going to have to take their turn at toeing.” There are protests going on in the streets of Brooklyn, and that makes you want to quit the story, to abandon them there. You’re aware that to get them up to northern Michigan on the Pere Marquette railroad would involve sheer luck, catching the train that is heading to the Grand Rapids line, and avoiding the line you’ve taken a hundred times to Kalamazoo, feeling the lame yank and pull of the Amtrak as it passes the old mills. They’ll huddle in a boxcar. They’ll leap off into snowdrifts. They’ll spot the cozy lights of a small town. They’ll eat a slice of pie at a lunch counter. A kind woman. Darkness pressing the windows. When you were a teenager, spending the summer in northern Michigan, you and a kid named Bud Pickett hopped a train on the tracks that ran along the shore of Little Traverse Bay, catching it along the straightaway. You ended up face-to-face with a cop at a grade crossing. The cop chased the train and caught you and took you to the jail in Harbor Springs. Grandma Means arrived to bail you out. Stately and prim. Gnarled fingers clutching the handle of her cane. You’ll give Buster her locutions, her way of speaking.) Compress the trip north into a few sentences: inside the boxcar, a pile of packing hay in one corner, Zac sucking on the mouth of a bottle, asking Buster to keep talking, to finish the story he’d started about the bum named Lockjaw. A switchman demonstrating the stop signal with a fusee in Calumet City, Illinois, January 1943, by Jack Delano. Courtesy Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Lockjaw was a bum suffering from tetanus, staying in a flop in Pittsburgh. There’s a doctor in the story. His name was Williams. The flophouse cots were stained and rusted. Williams jabbed the antitoxin into the boy’s arm. Downstairs, he stopped in the lobby to speak with the manager, Bud, who sat behind a chicken wire cage. Bud said the kid wasn’t going to stick around long enough to get himself cured doctor-wise. Williams touched his cap and nodded. Bud stuck a receipt onto a pointed spindle. Williams left the building and stood in the street. He heard the sound of a train. It filled him with sadness. (What the fuck does this doctor have to do with the story, Zac might say in the boxcar. What are you getting into here?) It’s later and Dr. Williams is at the dinner table. His wife, who is unable to have children, is speaking to him about God. God doesn’t want you to tend to flophouse men, dear. You should focus on delivering babies. In another scene, Williams is getting up in the morning, heading out on a call, the light dim as it pushes through the coke smoke and morning inversion fog, alighting softly upon sullen clapboard houses along the hill, striking the church that looms at the top, hulkingly awkward and out of place. The sun draws itself along the keen edge of tracks down which a train runs, warning a grade crossing with two longs and one short, a sound so routine that most of the time Williams, leaving his house for an early call, wouldn’t hear it because, frankly, to hear it would be to become, Buster would say, seized up with an unbearable sadness. That particular morning, he heard the train and crossed Hamlet Street and mounted the hill, heading to yet another millhouse in which a patient was waiting, moaning while the men on the front stoop sat and smoked and looked absently out at the street, holding still around the fear—because the terror of it was immense in them—the way they became still when making a big pour. The old doctor felt the edge forming, Buster would explain. He was feeling that fucking edge that gave him the urge to quit. He felt his professional bearing in the stroke of his heel on the pavement. He would bark orders and some kid would get a pot of water boiling. The kitchen table would be cleared and covered with linen for the patient to lie on. Then he’d reach in and rotate, if necessary, to clear the cord because, for some reason, these early morning calls almost always involved a problem, rarely a good old cephalic presentation, most often a breech or a preeclamptic caesarean, he thought as he walked, feeling his attention split and turn, first to the train and then for a moment to the kid in the flophouse yesterday. The sun plunged down and the windows glinted and the birds chirped as he walked past the men on the stoop, tipping his hat, lifting his bag a bit too quickly, by way of indicating his intentions, and in doing so causing the muted soft clink of his armamentarium—Buster would, if you let him, use that word—his forceps, his specula alongside the scissors, pessaries, and clamps against rheostats, with his scalpels silently tucked tight in the leather case. He crossed the threshold into the cramped house—a faint cabbage smell along with furnace coal and steaming water—while behind him, outside, still within range, he heard the train call him one last time, and then he was mounting narrow stairs toward the cries, woody and softer than expected, tightening around the task at hand, drawing his attention away from everything else. A bung scent in the wind. Hundreds of miles of water to the north as both men face it, looking and smoking and squinting. Dee clicked his stopwatch and called out for them to go to the next station. They sparred once a week. It was a fucking jab only a beginner would throw. Everything he had was in that single punch. No style, just force. Dee came back from his office and told the kid to go easy. Zac had the kid on the mat with a combination. (In his classic study The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Erving Goffman coined the phrase “working consensus,” which was then referenced in another classic study, Body & Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer by Loïc Wacquant, who applied the theory to his study of gym life, which is part of the fuel you want to use to imagine the story, giving it to Zac and his sparring scene and then to the two men, staggering down the tracks out of Chicago, working to keep each other alive, to buck the odds.) Go back in time to square the circle of actions. Dig into the particulars of Zac’s life in fits and starts. Sleeping in a flop one night and out on the street with a bottle the next until one winter evening he was slouched against a wall somewhere near the old water building on Michigan Avenue when Buster appeared—just as drunk and on the bum as he was—and crouched down to offer a bottle to his lips, an act of pure grace, speaking in his strange way, drawing from his book learning (and sounding a lot like your Grandma Means), until later that night he found himself asleep down in a thicket of weeds where there was a Hooverville encampment of lean-tos and shacks close to the lake, close enough to hear the slosh of water, not far from where the beautiful scalloped stainless steel of the Gehry bandshell sits in so-called Millennium Park, about twenty yards from where you and Geneve sat on a bench a few years ago, before the pandemic, and you talked about the men in the story you were catching, and how you imagined they slept tenderly against each other in a fetal position, trying to share heat and keep warm. Nobody wants a boxing story these days. The violence is what most people think about when they think about boxing. This story starts long after his time training in Woodlawn—the intimate sense of mission that held members of a boxing club together, the hours spent shadowboxing and tenderly helping one another on the table, holding ankles and trading tricks and techniques with an easygoing camaraderie that would sound strange and retrograde at this moment in history, in relation to the people marching and putting their lives on the line. But those men in the gym were all races and colors, too. Loïc Wacquant was white and French and trained alongside black fighters in Woodlawn, South Side Chicago. This future would seem delusional to these men. Zac would throw his arms in the air and ramble on and on and on about how his father had worked the mill beside people of color. He’d say: Yes, sir, united by the union these fuckers poured steel alongside one another, you see, and then he’d argue that when you were working at the mill, tending to a bucket on the floor, gazing through goggles and soot, sweating like a pig, when one small step meant death, you didn’t care the color of who you were with so long as they had your trust. One slip meant an explosion, a rain of sparks, and death. If given a chance, he’d go on and on and on about the men who manned the machines that flipped the hot ingots off the rollers. You know, he’d say, with all those levers that you had to throttle back and forth, using your gut and skill to guide yourself, with no fucking clue whose fingers were doing the work, he’d say, and then you’d let him ease up, feeling the urge to quit the story. You’d let him stop talking because you’d know it’s impossible to bring a voice like his, all tight nasal, all failure and despair, straining angrily against the dream, stuck in those forlorn early days of economic downfall, as much as you’re stuck in your own. Strand them like holy fools! Amplify the way the past is disposed in favor of the future. Avoid arrival to northern Michigan, lying on a flatbed, or in a coal car, or in the doorway of a box, staring up at the cold stars above the smear of farmland flattened under a foot of snow, smoothed over by cool moonlight until stubby, second-growth pine trees, burned to stumps, appeared near Horton Bay. Avoid watching the two of them leap from a train—that pie, that café, the warmth of that counter and the kind lady behind it—and instead let them fall into wonderful slumber, curled exhausted in a snow bank, giving in to the subzero night, as what’s left of the heat of their bodies quivers through the cloudless sky and into the eternity of dark space, which could be the final image of the story. Brittle stars shaking and settling into pointed brightness, casting a frail light down onto their frozen humps, which snow covers up slowly, like the back of the horse in the Chekhov story, too tired and weary from pulling his cart to offer a riffle of his thick, clotted mane or a small snort. Don’t give Zac a chance to stop eating blueberry pie in the café, or at a kitchen table, wiping the crumbs from his lips and saying, You only get an opportunity to quit the way I did once in your life. Or perhaps: You can only quit big-time once and that’s it, the big quit. You know, Buster, the way I see it, when I walked away on that fight I walked away for the first and last fucking time, if you know what I mean, because a person only has a chance to quit like that once in a lifetime. Let me tell you, it felt good to quit that way. It had to be done, I now see, because it was my big chance, and that means my big chance not only to win the big prize and lift my gloves in glory but also, the way I see it, to go out in a way that was just as big, and then he’d take another bite of pie and a sip of warm coffee and watch the young lady at the sink rubbing a dish towel into her tender, chapped hands, an image that would remind him of his own hands pushing the bar on the exit door, releasing him into the rear parking lot where a black sedan idled under the single street lamp emitting just enough light to illuminate two thugs, two second-rate gangsters who, as luck would have it, were dozing with their hats pulled down. No, before you quit you have to at least let them start walking so Buster can go on with the story he began telling back in East Chicago, his voice rising a little along with the wind—and explain the nature of those switches, because he had done a little time on the railroad after he left Pittsburgh, or maybe his old Uncle Ned had worked the Canadian Pacific Railway before going to the State Line junction to work the tower (you haven’t decided), and he’d explain that there were rods that ran from the tower out to the tracks, and that you’d throw the switches with big levers that drove the rods, and that they froze up from time to time, and then he’d go deeper into the mystery of the great juncture of the tracks, a crossing point of future destinies—the men felt. It was part of the job, that feeling. Part of the job was to gaze out the tower window and to sense the mythic aspect that was inherent in all that tonnage being shifted from one set to another, or taking their lunch buckets down to watch the inbound trains approaching the arrays—nothing better than four trains coming through at once, each one avoiding the other, or, for a few minutes, on approach, drawing a bead on one another, showing the potential for collision touched with the grace of avoidance. The men were fully versed in the stories of collisions, and a few had witnessed the aftermath, or studied postcard images of the great crashes of yore. They knew about hotbox burnouts and overheated journal bearings, and the odd, almost supernatural head-ons that ended with one engine neatly atop another, sliding up and over, defying the bulk, seesawing like a duck probing for food. Not to mention the crown sheet failures, overheating due to low water, a misread dial, a sleeping crewman, blasting out mounds of twisted superheater tubes. The junction was foolproof with checks and double checks but it wasn’t—the men liked to say—idiotproof. The only thing idiotproof, Buster might say if you let him, is a coffin lid. You shut it, it closes and stays closed. The idiot that day was a man named Jed Row, a boozer who fucked it up, who set a west- and an east-bound, one of them baked up good and hot on the brilliantly straight and clean line that—Buster would explain—teased all of the engineers, held itself out as raw temptation to get the coal screwing wildly into the firebox, throbbing and hot, the heart of the beast roaring beyond speed limits. All railmen understood the paradox, the truth that they hate switch arrays—or, using the appropriate parlance, turnouts—because of the stress they put on the wheels, and the ugly, abrupt shifting from one line to another. You’d let Buster spin into the way Jed got the switches into the wrong position and then ramble on about how engineers dreaded head-ons whereas conductors, in their secret hearts, dreaded telescoping accidents, and all remembered the great accidents at Camp Hill, Revere, and, above all, the Mud Run disaster where—he’d add—sure, the cars were made of wood rather than steel and scoped into each other with horrific neatness while at the same time the engineers walked away from the wreckage to work another day. But when the idiot tried to pull the lever he felt resistance along the line, a rebuff of his efforts, staring dully at the big ratchet handle, and then, as protocol dictated, sent a maintainer kid out to check the rod, which most likely had frozen up in the cold, and the kid went out and found another half-dead hobo—Lockjaw—having a seizure, all control lost, Buster would explain, and then he’d shift back to general talk about the junction, about the way it stood silent, empty and quiet when things were dead, suspended between ingoing and outgoing, with the dew-wet rails burning like etched glass in the rising sun, ticking and gathering heat while everything waited for action and gave over to the sense that out there, in the beyond, trains were moving across the land. Buster had the rest of that story in his mouth. He could feel it as they stood in the weeds and looked at the lake. He inhaled smoke and looked at Zac, who had a fine, wide face and a high brow and had, as he took off his hat and ran his hands through his hair, a bemused look that brought his eyebrows up. The story had to be told because it was only half finished and in his throat. In the boxcar—huddled in the packing straw, trying to stay warm—Buster would continue his story. There was something holy—he’d say—seized-up somatic muscles, hopeless and hidden, the tension between mind and flex, the bending back and up with the paradoxical combination of rigid and flexible, he’d explain, saying it was Williams’s point of view, all this. Zac would grunt and pop the dry bottle off his lips. He’d seen men with the DTs, he’d seen men doing St.Vitus’s dance with an odd elasticity, eyes rolled back to the whites. He was shivering and imagined logs shifting in a fire, a hot stove radiating warmth, the suck of air through a flue. Buster shivered, too, and drew the collar of his outer coat up around his neck. The door to the boxcar was jammed partway open and snow was blowing in. He was feeling the vanity he used to feel, back in the day, and in that vanity he felt the urge to confess to Zac. He was thinking about the Pittsburgh dawn, the tannic smog scooped at the bottom of the hill with sunlight trying to get through, hitting the church. He was thinking of his wife in the chair, looking across the dining room table with the blank, winter-dark windows behind her. He was thinking about the deskman snapping a receipt into the spindle, giving him a blank look when he asked about the kid. No encephalitic deformities, no breech births or blue babies or kitchen-table caesareans in this fucking life, he thought, feeling the cold coming through the flap in his shoe. The story was his fucking story, he’d admit, wiggling his toe. Zac wouldn’t believe it if he told him. I’m Williams, he might say and get a laugh. This big reveal would make you wince, look away, feeling the same betrayal Buster felt when he thought about his former life, his wife across from him at the dining room table, holding her cup and looking at him with—he admitted to himself—a schoolmarmish, spinsterish cast to her thin, delicate features during those moments, as if she had resigned herself to the fact that long ago he had abandoned her outright, not so much to the obligations of his profession as to his fantasies of the road, doing Christ’s will on earth, nursing vagrants back to health. You’re working too hard, she liked to say to him, widening her eyes, holding her cup with her finger extended and sipping primly and then slowly, ever so slowly, placing her cup on the saucer (a sound he could still hear) while he stared past her at the lace curtains where another Pittsburgh night descended, filling the hollows, up the hills lined with houses, and the long bulk of the Homestead Works roared and sparked not far away. Shivering, consumed with the cold, Buster could remember how it felt that morning to give in to the feeling. His own tossing in of the towel. He had only imagined poor Lockjaw’s life after he disappeared from the flophouse, as he crossed the bridge that morning, heading to that call, his bag clinking. That was the point of origin of his life now, he thought. His gut, shrunken to the size of a hickory nut, grumbled. In the rock of the boxcar over rough tracks he saw himself ease the speculum apart—his brow light catching sight of dilation that afternoon, his mind half in the task, half out, trying to imagine the whereabouts of the patient from the flophouse. The patient on his table was Mary Kearney and she was late in her term, a beauty with pale skin and a small berry-shaped mouth that seemed pursed for a kiss, and wide, deep blue eyes set in a high brow and cheekbones that caught whatever light was at hand to provide a stunning blend of delicacy and breadbasket fullness, all combined with a shame that manifested itself when she felt the cold implement and gave a single, quick wince and then uttered a sigh. He felt the cold in the flap of his shoe and the cold of the speculum. He knew he’d remember that sight forever, after the exam was over, his life, his career, his marriage. The image had to be put away where, as a profession, he placed the inherent natural desires that came from his work. He said, Fine, good, perfect, nice, everything looks good, and so on and so forth, trying in his voice to establish a light jocularity, saying, Looks like the bread is about ready to be taken out of the oven, or some other banality to ease the burden—his and his patient’s—then his vision shifted and he was delivering her baby a week later, drawing her out and leaning her in the crook of his arm the way he was trained, clearing her throat, cutting the cord while Mrs.Drake, the nurse, stepped forward and folded the drape back, covering Mary up—a stunner, he would admit later. I’m a full-blooded Pittsburgh man, he told himself. Take this to the autoclave, he heard himself say, the boxcar rattling in a buffeting wind, while behind him with a dry, starchy rustle, Mary hoisted her bloomers over her hips and patted her hair down. When he turned she presented herself with a thankful face, one that made him smile as the train roared through the Michigan night. (Once when you were a kid you found yourself ice-skating on a pond with a young woman named Mary Kearney. It was snowing hard and the ice had to be brushed off with a broom. You worked your backward crossover and spun around her and then, suddenly, the two of you were immersed inside a sensational movement, joining mittens and spinning, falling and laughing, and she turned her face up to you—in the feeble darkness, barely visible—and for a moment you felt a flash of what seemed to be love, at least to your teenage brain, and you filed that moment and told yourself not to forget it, so you didn’t. She was in her white cable-knit sweater, her red cheeks dabbled with melted snowdrops, her mouth several years older and beyond reach. You knew that she’d be forever in your memory as a point of love, twisted in with the feeling of the blades on the ice and the sudden quiet as you fell down together and looked up into the falling snow and heard the shush of wind through the pines on the edge of the pond.) At some point you’d let Buster speak, inspired to put his vision into a confession, to bring his memory into the boxcar, and you’d watch Zac blink himself awake, standing up to brush the hay off his legs, going to the boxcar door and looking out into the strange milky darkness of snowfall. Then you’d listen as he said, simply, Williams, Jesus, that makes sense. A man who speaks the way you speak. They began to move because you let them. Heading toward the twist, the big reveal. (The city down the river right now is in a lockdown and yet the trains are still running. You can hear the Metro-North train horn in Croton across the water and the low hum of the engine too. As a boy you could hear the sound of the switcher train down in the mill yard, shunting boxcars of paper around and, at other times, on tracks to the west, over the hill, the Chicago train arriving into town, its horn trailing as it warned of various grade crossings—one at Stadium Drive, another at Clark Street, coming into town near your grandfather’s house.) The sky began to shed a feeble, dry snow into the wind. Buster’s shoe had a leather flap where the stitching was worn and he had to stop to shake the snow out. Zac was talking about the future again, about his uncle who was, he admitted, a little fruity. The prize fight—the sparring session—was gone from his mind, replaced by the thirst he was feeling and the rumble in his gut. He spread his arms out and marched ahead. Buster fell behind. Buster jogged and caught up and then fell back again. Finally they reached the turnoff switch to the north and straight on to the east—and waded back into the weeds to crouch, to wait for a slow one, watching the switch signal, staying low in the blowing wind, not saying a word, until there was a glint of a headlight and the sound of a coming train—in this moment they were deep in routine, perfectly still. Here she comes, Buster finally said. His voice was husky and soft. He stood up and moved to the tracks and Zac followed him in a doggish manner. Far off, hidden in the snowfall, a train was coming, giving them both an immediate sense of anticipation and destiny as they crouched down studying its approach, waiting for the moment—because the train was moving slowly on account of the switch—that would allow them to study their options, to locate the exact right place to leap, an open doorway with some other fellows reaching down to help, or an empty one that looked particularly enticing. And then the train would do all the work to get them up there, to release you from the burden of making it all up, and you’d watch, and listen, sending your love to them through time, memory, and space so that at least for a few minutes, on the way north, they’d be alive again, holding on to each other in the corner of the car, looking out the doorway at the passing farms, the flat, soggy old winter fields, where all stories rest alone in the silence of time itself, you think, trying not to let them go, trying to find a way to get them to pause, two wayward men down in that verge, looking for the headlight that they both know will appear, submerged in snow and growing brighter by the second.

        "story": "My father told me this story. He said it happened one Christmas Eve many years ago. A boy was walking alone alongside a highway and saw the lights of the A&P grocery store ahead of him in the darkness. The boy walked down into a ravine and across the deserted parking lot and stood in front of the store’s automatic doors until they opened and admitted him. “Hurry up, hon,” said a woman at the register. “We’re closing soon.” Christmas music played over the loudspeaker and a big display of canned hams sat right at the front of the store. The pile of stacked cans went halfway to the ceiling. Each can was decorated with a picture of a family—a father and a mother and a boy and a girl—all sitting around a table with a ham on a platter in the center of it. Each member of the family was looking at the ham and smiling like they had never seen anything as amazing and beautiful, as miraculous, as a ham on a platter. The girl seemed particularly out of her mind with joy. She was clasping her hands together, beaming at the ham in ecstasy. Next to the canned ham display was a gingerbread house resting on a cloud of cotton balls. The boy reached out and touched one of the walls. Styrofoam. The floor of the A&P had white tiles alternating with red tiles. The boy made his way down the aisle slowly, stepping only on the red tiles. The Christmas music stopped playing. A man’s voice came over the loudspeaker and said, “A&P shoppers! We will be closing in five minutes. We wish you and yours a merry Christmas.” The Christmas music started up again, and the boy made it to the end of the aisle, all the way to the meat counter, without stepping on a single white tile. To the right of the meat counter was a little wooden house. The house had green shutters and a green door and a brick chimney and a wooden chair out front. A velvet rope was strung around the house and the chair, and there was a sign on a pole that said, santa has gone to feed the reindeer. he’ll be right back! The boy climbed over the rope and pushed on the green door of the house. It was flimsy, made out of cardboard, and it opened onto a dark interior. There was nothing inside. But what if he had gone through the green door and found a warm room with a fireplace and a fire? And what if in front of the fire there had been a big, overstuffed chair? And what if there had been something cooking over the fire, like a stew or some soup? The boy had once seen a poster of a rabbit in a burrow on the wall of the school library. The rabbit had a plaid blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He was sitting in an armchair in front of a fireplace, and his big, furry feet were up on a footstool. The rabbit was talking to a mole, who was standing in front of the fire, stirring something in a big pot. The mole was wearing slippers—green ones. And he looked like he was listening to what the rabbit was saying. The rabbit held a mug in his front paws. Steam was rising out of the mug, glittering in the light of the fire, and the rabbit’s whiskers and ears were outlined in the same light. So was the mole’s nose. Two pictures hung on roots emerging from the dirt wall of the room. One of the pictures was of an older mole lady, wearing glasses and a lace shawl. She was smiling down at the fireplace, looking at the mole and the rabbit with approval. The other picture was of the rabbit and the mole in front of the fire, just as they were in the poster. The boy liked the dizzy way the picture made him feel—as if there were worlds hidden inside of other worlds, going on to infinity. At the bottom of the poster were the words on a winter’s night. The school librarian had seen the boy staring at the poster and asked him if he would like to check out the book. “No,” he said. “It’s all just made up, isn’t it? It’s just a story.” “Well, yes,” said the librarian. “I suppose so, but it’s a good story.” He couldn’t explain it to her—what a big waste of time it would be to believe that anything like that could happen, that a rabbit and a mole could be friends and sit around in front of a fire talking. “A&P shoppers!” said the man over the loudspeaker. “We appreciate your business. The store is now closed.” The Christmas music stopped, and the only noise was the hum of the refrigerators and freezers. The boy sat down in the little house and leaned up against the cardboard wall. Maybe he would just sleep for a while. He was tired. He put his head on his knees and wrapped his arms around his legs. Curling up like that made him think of Martin Miner. Martin Miner was a kid at school who rolled himself up into a little ball every time the other kids started to pick on him. “Less surface area.” That was what Martin Miner had said to the boy when they were sitting together outside the principal’s office. “When there’s less surface area, you’re smaller. And then there’s less of you to hurt.” Martin’s face was swollen and scraped, bleeding in places. “It looks to me like you got hurt pretty bad,” said the boy. Martin Miner put up a hand and touched his face. “Yeah,” he said. “I guess so. But what I’m worried about is my glasses. They’re broken.” He held them up. The glasses were in two distinct pieces. “Can you see without them?” Martin blinked. “I can see some things. But not the details.” “Who needs details?” the boy said. He was bleeding, too. But only on his knuckles, and it was from hitting someone, not from being hit. “I like details,” said Martin Miner in a dreamy voice. “I like the patterns in bird feathers and the veins on leaves and those little feelers on ants; and also, punctuation. I like seeing punctuation marks.” The boy felt a drop of sweat dribble down the side of his face. It was hot in the hallway. They were sitting next to a radiator. “My mother is going to be mad,” Martin said. “The glasses were expensive. Maybe Santa will get me a new pair. I was hoping for a train set, but maybe he can get me glasses instead.” “Give them to me,” said the boy. Martin Miner handed him the glasses. “I could fix these,” said the boy. “Really?” said Martin Miner. The door to the principal’s office opened and the principal stuck his head out and said, “Martin, come in here. We’re going to talk about why this keeps happening to you.” Martin stood up. The principal pointed the stem of his pipe at the boy. “I’ll deal with you next,” he said. Martin went into the office. The principal closed the door. “Sure you will,” said the boy. “Sure you’ll deal with me.” The radiator ticked; the fluorescent lights hummed. The boy put Martin’s glasses in the chest pocket of his jacket, and then he stood up and headed down the empty hallway and out of the building. He did not look behind him. That had been Thursday, the last day of school before Christmas break. Inside the A&P, in the little pretend house, the boy touched the front pocket of his jacket. The glasses were still there. He pulled the pieces out and held them up and looked at them. He shook his head. Why would Martin Miner just hand over his glasses? Why would he believe that the boy could fix anything? The overhead lights went out in the A&P. The boy stood up. He held himself still for a minute, blinking, waiting until his eyes adjusted to the gloom, and then he went through the little green door and stepped over the velvet rope. The parking lot lights were still on. He could see them glowing. He walked down the aisle toward the front of the store. Would his mother wonder where he was? Probably not. She probably wasn’t even home. She was probably still at the bar, working. Or maybe done with work and at some party. Who could say? She didn’t tell the boy her plans. “Nobody tells me their plans,” she had said to him once. “Do you think your father ever told me his plans? Huh?” At the front of the store, the boy found a section with Scotch tape and notebooks and pencils and pens and masking tape. He held the two pieces of Martin Miner’s glasses up to the light coming in from the parking lot, and then he tore a long piece of masking tape from one of the rolls and wound it around the center of the glasses until the two pieces were joined. The boy put Martin Miner’s glasses on and looked out at the parking lot. It was snowing. Great, fat flakes were twirling down. The glasses bent the world and made it look like a painting that someone had swiped a hand through, blurring it before it dried. “Details, huh?” said the boy. “I don’t see any details.” He stared out at the smeary world. In the whiteness, there suddenly appeared a dark shape. It looked like a deer. Not just a deer, but a giant buck. The boy shook his head. He took the glasses off and folded them carefully and put them in the pocket of his jacket, and then he looked out at the parking lot again. The deer was still there, its outlines sharper now, more distinct. The boy’s father had taken him hunting once, before he disappeared for good. The boy was younger then, and it had been cold in the woods. “The most important thing is that you got to keep your eyes open,” his father told him. “Don’t ever close your eyes.” The boy was the one who had seen the deer. He was the one who had pointed him out to his father. But when his father raised the rifle to shoot, the boy had pulled at his arm, trying to stop him, and the shot missed the deer’s heart. A bright patch of red appeared on the deer’s neck, and the deer had looked right at the boy. He had given him a great, sorrowful glance of disbelief before he turned and leapt away. His father had been furious. “The biggest buck I’ve ever seen, and what do you do? Shove me. Shove me and I miss.” Now, looking out at the deer in the parking lot, the boy had the crazy thought that this was the same animal, the same deer his father had tried to kill. The boy watched as the buck moved toward him through the yellow light and the falling snow. He watched as the deer came right up to the automatic doors and stood looking into the darkened store. “Here I am,” said the boy. “Stay there. Wait there.” He turned and ran past the canned ham family, past the Styrofoam gingerbread house and down the aisle, past the Santa throne and the empty little house, past the meat counter and through a swinging door into the stockroom. He pushed his way past boxes and pallets. He banged his shin on a shelving unit. He ran toward the exit sign glowing in the dark. He pushed on the handle of the door. An alarm went off and the boy was out and in the alley and running toward the front of the store. The snow was coming down fast and the boy’s heart was pounding, saying the same two words over and over: Be there. Be there. Be there. The deer was there. Standing in front of the automatic doors. “Here,” said the boy. “I’m here.” The great antlered head turned in his direction, and then the deer started to walk away from the store, away from the boy. He stopped once, and looked over his shoulder, and then continued walking. “Should I follow you?” said the boy. “Am I supposed to follow you?” The deer made his way through the empty, snowy parking lot. The boy followed, staying several steps behind. The snow kept falling. They walked past houses with yellow windows and strings of bright Christmas lights. The boy’s shoes were wet and his pants were soaked through and the snow was coming so fast and thick that it was sometimes hard to see, but each time they walked beneath a streetlight, the deer’s antlers were suddenly outlined in gold and the boy wasn’t cold or afraid. The deer walked down the middle of the street and then into the front yard of a small house with a Christmas tree in the window. The deer stopped and the boy went and stood beside him. They were both breathing hard. A face appeared in the front window, next to the lighted Christmas tree. Martin. Martin Miner. “I’ve got this kid’s glasses,” said the boy to the deer. The deer turned and looked at the boy. His eyes were weary and bright. The boy felt dizzy. He put out his hand and touched the deer’s neck, felt his heart pulsing, felt the warmth of him, the reality of him. Martin came running out of his house. “Hey,” shouted Martin. The deer turned and in one fluid movement leapt over the box hedge and disappeared into the swirling snow. “I saw him,” said Martin. “It was a reindeer!” “No,” said the boy. “It was just a wild deer.” “Martin!” shouted a woman from the doorway. “What in the world are you doing?” “Here,” said the boy. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the glasses. “You fixed them!” said Martin. “They’re not fixed. I just taped them together.” Martin put the glasses on and looked around at the world, smiling. “Get in here!” shouted Martin’s mother. “You have to come in,” said Martin. “She’ll be mad if you don’t come in.” The boy went inside and Martin’s mother made him sit down in front of the fire. “People die from walking around like that, all soaking wet in the cold,” she said. She put a big, heavy blanket around his shoulders. It was warm, so warm, but the boy couldn’t stop shivering. And then he was crying—great, heaving sobs. Martin didn’t say anything. He just sat next to the boy in front of the fire. Christmas music was playing. Somewhere out in the woods, beyond the little house and the lights and the fire and the music, the deer was walking, putting one foot in front of the other. The deer was alive. His heart was beating. The boy had felt it. He had felt the deer’s beating heart. He had felt, too, a scar on the deer’s neck, the thickened skin where something had entered him, broken through him, and then, somehow, miraculously healed over. And to the boy, this meant that he had been forgiven, and he thought that this was a very good Christmas gift. My father told me this story once when I was young, and then again when I was grown and he was very old. Both times, I asked him the same question. “Were you the boy?” The first time I asked him, he told me that it didn’t matter—that it was a story, just a story. But when I asked him the question the second time, when I asked him again, “Were you the boy?” my father turned to me and said, “I felt it. I felt the bullet inside of him. It was still there.” He started to cry. “Do you understand?” “Yes,” I said. “Do you understand how warm it was in front of Martin Miner’s fire?” “Yes,” I told him. “I understand.” And I sat with my father and held his hand and let him cry.

        "story": "Angie said through convoluted gasps brought on by racing Adderall thoughts that Saint died at his desk so Jean could get his job. Jean insisted between tangents of laughter that she didn’t find it the least bit funny and privately wondered why Angie always wore such itchy sweaters when she was prone to worry raw every sensitivity imaginable. Her companion looked as if she were made of gold and worshiping herself, the way she slipped her hands up and down her arms in a perfect, hungry rhythm. “I thought we were having a serious conversation!” cried Jean. Angie rolled her eyes and picked at her lip. They were roommates, but spent many days, like this one, at Angie’s parents’ amply chambered burrow on the Upper West Side, where she had her own wing, like a rock star in a hospital: bed, bath, and a little someplace extra for the well-wishes to accumulate (Jean slept here). Angie grew up with plenty of money, Jean did not—though not quite poor either, in a suburb of Pittsburgh with two brothers, parents apolitical, tolerant, then separated and largely absent, the father out in San Diego, mom remarried to a gregarious, yelling man. Angie often thought she might have turned out better if her parents had been less involved in her life, or if there were several states between them, rather than just a few walls. When Angie expressed this sentiment, Jean would point out that despite the proximity, her friend hardly saw her parents. Anyway, it was Jean who might have had cause to envy the close-knit self-sufficiency Angie’s parents had modeled for her, were she not so impervious to wanting what other people had. The women had met at the Manhattan college Jean graduated from six months early and Angie not at all. Jean easily spent more time at Angie’s parents’ apartment than she ever did on campus. “I’m not saying that because I believe it,” continued Angie. “I’m saying it because my sister does. Her sixth sense is professional management. She has a talent for keeping the great wheel of comeuppance and comethroughance functional and dynamic and fucking crystal.” Angie, a born Translator of Grievances, let her eyes bulge and recede in a fixed pattern like the hands of a magician casting a spell over an empty hat. “Maggie told you that—that Saint’s death has to do with destiny?” “Please, you know she keeps her distance. But I can just imagine how she’s taking all this. I’ve had to sharpen that faculty of late, given how little she tells me about her life. She isn’t a good person.” Maggie was twelve years older than Angie and had her life conspicuously together. She ran Readsome Enterprises, a literary agency she’d founded nearly a decade prior with the considerable assistance of her family’s money, and which Jean had worked at for the past two years, beginning as an intern. Angie hadn’t thought twice about recommending her friend for the job. Jean needed one, and she would have accepted whatever came her way. It was a small agency with six employees. There were five agents and one associate who worked closely with Maggie and was thought of as an agent-in-training (this was the higher-paying assistant job Jean had just been promoted into). All of them fussed over a modest list of clients who regularly didn’t write. Despite this, the group got written about in the press quite a bit, and had more cachet than the imposing corporate outfits. None of this was due to Saint’s passing, which had been kept out of the media, privately gossiped about and mourned, even though it occurred in the office. The firm’s notoriety rested, rather, on the mysterious personality of Maggie’s husband, the novelist Teller Fane. A famous recluse in the era of influencers and data mining, Fane had for decades managed to evade the public eye—but not the rampant speculation, stoked by rumors of sporadic excursions into the city to visit his wife or carry out some other unadvertised errand. The New York Post once reported him dead due to an imprudent, unsourced outburst on legacy media Twitter. The little that was known about him was picked over ravenously in every conceivable outlet, from literary magazines to Reddit threads. It was said that he was vegan (but his characters were always eating meat?!) and that he didn’t write any of his novels himself because Teller Fane was actually\nthe name of a mind-control corporation, or a different, even more ingenious, male novelist. No picture of Fane past the age of twenty-five existed on the internet, and he’d be turning forty-eight that spring. The image that accompanied most coverage concerning him, the one that graced his book jackets, had been taken at a bar on Grand Street in the late Nineties; it featured a pained smile, two tumblers of scotch on the hazy bartop behind him, and a lit cigarette. It didn’t exactly do him a disservice to remain twenty-five forever. In those early days he’d looked like a young Peter Falk—rather handsome, if you’re into that sort of thing. For the past two decades, Fane had been steadily working away on what he considered a single project of interlacing fictions called The Archipelago. In each of the novels, his characters occupied an insular conceptual or physical terrain. One was set on a private island owned by a billionaire which plays host to sinister tech summits, celebrity supper clubs, and Travel Channel specials; another on a small island nation that is rapidly disappearing into the sea because of climate change; another in a prison; another deep inside the mind of a philosophy professor; another on a large volcanic landmass thrust up from the sea in 1652 and settled by a cabal of insane Dutch explorers who eat all the strange roots and animals they find there, die in many new and exciting ways, and are written out of history. The new books arrived every year or two. Most of them were fairly short and might even have been marketed as novellas if someone else had written them. Characters from one novel sometimes wandered into another, but the frame of each individual work was tight. Some of his sentences were very short indeed, and this too attracted little comment, much less than the invisible life he led. None of the books were set in Manhattan, which was either a wasted opportunity or a rule of thumb. It was said that Fane’s work was inspired by The Human Comedy, and literary Twitter sometimes referred to him as “Sad Balzac.” Angie, of course, had a different take on the matter. “The island theme is nothing but a gimmick. What he writes are books about people who don’t go anywhere.” And Jean would retort that some people really don’t. This was a sentiment Angie claimed not to understand, although Jean couldn’t see why. Angie resembled her ambitious sister in some respects: a hot streak of passions, terrifyingly competent. Sleep was her enemy and she didn’t seem to need much of it. Beautiful language brought on fevers, music showered paroxysms of ecstasy and despair upon her head, mediocre television left her colder than a rock floating in space. Only, unlike her sister, she had no schedule, no job, no man, no clue which of her drastic moods she’d awaken to tomorrow. Without a socially legible purpose to her days, she and her sister looked to the world like exact opposites. “I checked out Saint’s Instagram,” offered Jean. “Hundreds of pictures—friends, Europe, trees—but only a couple of them with him in it. Nothing tagged.” “Like he was making a guest appearance on his own show.” “Maybe he didn’t like himself.” “He was supposed to be a teetotaler with his condition, that’s what he kept telling you, right? Did he drink so much because he knew his heart was too erratic to take it?” “I don’t think so. Nothing points to it. He just worked more than he needed to. Sometimes I think maybe he was celebrating a little, you know? Testing something out, trying not to be afraid.” Then Jean added, in order to show herself capable of sympathizing with Angie’s depressive cynicism, “I’m surprised more people aren’t discussing it on Twitter, though.” Angie scoffed. “I’m not. He was an assistant and only had like two hundred followers.” “But he went to Harvard!” “Oh, but Jean, you must know by now that where I’m from—and where you’re heading at a stunning velocity—having gone to Harvard is even more common than wanting to die.” Jean gave a conciliatory smile and said nothing, feeling it was kinder to hold her tongue. Five days ago, before Angie had left the apartment they shared in Crown Heights for another of her regular West Side respites, Jean had discovered the pieces of a torn page in the trash, mixed in with leftover oatmeal and toothpaste packaging. A line had been drawn through the words “not to live.” These were words Jean had heard Angie say out loud before, many times. “What I want is not to live anymore.” Words that hung in the air, where they could not be struck through and binned. Jean first assumed that the scraps came from a letter, but they could just as easily have been slivers of a diary entry Angie wished to retract from the record. The fragments disturbed Jean, but not deeply. They conformed to Angie’s strict embrace of excess. Even the crossed-out words were excess: a morbid sentiment, a renunciation, followed by physical repulsion. All her passions came to this, eventually. Crossed out as if in an attempt to multiply them. Still, Jean followed Angie to Manhattan the next day. She made sure Angie was on her feet by the time she left for work. On her way back from the office, she picked up dinner for both of them, something healthy, which Angie could have for lunch the next day if she was out for the evening. Or, if she was around, Jean would happily chatter with her until midnight, when she would crash from the effort of it all. At the same time, Jean admitted that their relationship—the whole situation—felt uniquely comfortable. She even loved the Upper West Side, which Angie complained about incessantly, in a manner that was funny and charming but inevitably spoiled. Locals walked the streets with worry plastered on their faces, their peacoats, faded Patagonia, and beat-up leather jackets oddly lumpy, as if stuffed with D’Agostino plastic bags. This frumpiness was the cost of admission to dwell for decades in the Kingdom of the Fair. Everyone felt a little guilty, but then again they were in therapy for that. To Jean, a tourist, it was pleasure itself. The warm interiors where one could hole up all day, the auspicious tartines she ferried back from local bakeries, the brisk commute to her midtown workplace on any of five efficient subway lines. The only downside as far as Jean was concerned was the yearning she felt each time she finished the excursion, her fate sealed up again in the sepulchral Kingdom of Obligation, to quit her job and retire here. It wasn’t as if their apartment in Brooklyn was squalid. It could have been fine, but the noise from the street and the train got in, the lighting was cruel, the contents of her closet were upon the floor, the laptop was always open to some meaningless celebrity scandal that sucked the time away, the dishes piled up and made Jean want to forget herself. “I never knew someone who died,” said Jean. “Nobody relatively young at least. I guess I’m only twenty-three.” “So am I!” “But you didn’t know anyone who died suddenly like that, did you?” “Yes I did! A girl I went to high school with died in a motorcycle accident a year after graduation. And then there’s my brother-in-law of course.” “Only he isn’t dead. Sorry about your friend.” “Not much respect for the dead.” “Try getting respect from them first. He hasn’t spoken a word to me in ten years, meanwhile my sister exists for him alone. She barely pretends to have a relationship with me anymore. Worse than dead, he’s death itself!” For about three months, Angie had been seeing a painter by the name of Frank Wade. He was only twenty-six and had already managed to gain a modest reputation, not to mention a couple of sales, enough to disappear for long periods of time. The occasional graphic design gig meant he never needed to call in favors from any of his willing friends. A penny saved is a penny that can’t be thrown at you in violence or disgust later on. On their first date, Frank told Angie he was possessed by a demon, possibly several demons. The demon would show him visions of what to paint next, communicating in the angles of sun rays and dreams. In bouts of cloudiness and dreamlessness he was frightfully abandoned and, by his own admission, not fit for human company. Due to his inconstancy and Angie’s growing attachment, their flimsy relationship operated on a timescale of eras coalescing into matters of historical record. At least for Angie. Jean was up at the crack of dawn listening to Angie recount her much-awaited seventh date with Frank. It had been three Fridays since Saint’s death. “His paintings have gotten more abstract since I met him. Blue, green, and black; a teensy bit pink. He tells me they’re dragons. That’s a boundary I don’t respect. To me they have nothing to do with dragons at all! I think he’s depressed, and in love—with me, hopefully. He says he wants to take me on a trip. He said ‘anywhere in the world,’ which is very lenient, don’t you think? I suggested the Balearic Islands and he got all mad with joy. We fucked three times. Well, twice. Why not Majorca? That’s where Robert Graves had his printing press. Nadal is from there. I wonder if his little town hosts an annual festival in his honor. We could plan the trip around that. As if it were Mardi Gras or an eclipse.... ” Jean let her go on—it had been hard enough for Angie to get over the last one, Daniel, the guy who held a knife to her throat while they made love, then moved to England to patch things up with his wife—but only to a point. “Listen to yourself! Hear the words coming out of your mouth. You’re so fucking horny for... what?... this pipsqueak artist guy? Can’t you—” “Yes, I want his cock permanently installed in my mouth, who cares? The only thing hornier than having sex is not having it. Meditate on that, let it fill you with fuck-less, dick-less inspiration, or whatever it is that gets you off.” Angie writhed with laughter. For a moment Jean wanted to love anything as much as Angie loved this twenty-six-year-old RISD dropout who made even his closest friends call him on a landline. Then the desire passed, and that splendid coolness she relied on to shepherd her through lethargic days at the office and evenings of placid reading returned to her. She retrieved Angie’s English muffin from the toaster, placed it on a clean plate, and left for work. Several inches of snow had fallen the night before. The city was slow and empty on its face. Belowground, on her morning commute, the usual frazzled mush of passengers and gray water congealed. She was third to arrive at the office, behind Maggie and another agent. It was possible the rest of the staff wouldn’t bother to come in at all given the nasty turn in the weather. The office’s atmosphere revealed nothing about the recent tragedy that had unfolded there. Maybe it was the serene sliding glass doors of the agents’ offices, which surrounded an open sprawl of desks. Maybe it was that one person occupied this central area now, and it was Jean, who had only been joined by Saint for a couple of months as he began his transformation into a bona fide agent. Kelly-green carpets, pale-yellow walls, light wood paneling along the edges of the glass doors, which matched the bookshelves framing an entrance to the elevator, soft light, desk lamps, like a classy pool hall where everyone just reads. Maybe it was the absence of mess (the cleaning staff had found Saint’s body). Maybe it was that an inappropriately large office for such a minor operation bred nothing but space between people; the very air was toxic to gossip, and sympathy, and dread. An hour before Jean’s lunch break, Maggie Fane approached her desk. She had the mirthful, uncompromising gaze of a former party girl turned arts executive. Her abundant chestnut hair was kept out of her face with a single pin. Jean had never really tried to form an opinion about her, and she was starting to wonder whether Maggie was having that effect on purpose. “It’s really great you came in today, Jean, thanks so much! What have you got going on this morning?” Maggie always spoke about jobs with an air of their being volunteer positions. “Jonathan had to step out for a meeting, so I’m surveilling Norma Desmond.” This was the code name for Readsome’s most managed male client, who demanded that an agent watch him at all times during his weekday writing hours. Remarkably, the books did get done and were very sexually explicit. “Nanny cam duty,” said Maggie with a sigh. “I find it relaxing, myself.” “I find yoga relaxing,” said Jean. “Office yoga, now that would be great for morale! Jean, I have a request to make of you. Feel free to refuse.” “Okay.” “I’d like for you to speak to my husband. Privately, I’ve been mourning the passing of Saint... and discussing it with my husband quite a bit.” Here Maggie left room for Jean to echo her distress, but Jean kept quiet. She was not one to unsettle silences. “My husband has become interested in Saint. It’s for a novel he’s writing, the story of a man who is thinking of ending his life, or gaining an entirely new one. I told him that of everyone in the office you spent the most time with Saint. It’s rude of me to ask, I’m aware of that. We can just forget the whole thing if you’d like.” Jean sensed that Maggie was being insincere, as usual. Of course the request seemed rude to Jean—in the sense that all work was an impertinence that placed her days in service to another. And it was rude to pretend as if there existed no other personal matters between them. As if she didn’t live with Maggie’s sister! But Jean wanted to talk to the famous writer and relay everything to Angie later. “When would your husband like to speak with me?” “Today would work well, if you’re amenable. Can I give him your cell?” An hour later, he called. “Hello, Jean? This is Teller.” The voice rattled Jean. It was delicate, with a hint of offense already taken, like a lace trim on an otherwise indefinite figure. It was not cerebral, and it was not warm, and it was not automated. The voice was a carcass. Its pitch was that of wind when it finally reaches a charming little house after miles of emptiness, then blows right past it. “Hello, Mr. Fane. Yes, I was expecting your call.” “You can call me ‘Maggie’s husband’ if you’d like. But I prefer Teller.” “I don’t know. It’s weird to speak to a ‘Teller.’” “Why do you think I never grant interviews?” Jean laughed despite the engrossing formality of the situation. “Maggie said you wanted to talk to me about Saint?” “I do. I know it’s a strange request, and perhaps a vulgar one. I don’t mean it that way. I just get curious about people, although I try not to involve myself personally with what I’m writing about. Of course, I know I’m writing about myself no matter how elaborate the fiction, but I never think about it. My process works for me. Or it usually does. For some reason I’ve been having difficulty lately. My wife speaks highly of you and your friendship with my sister-in-law. Stop me if any of this provokes thought or even pity in you.” “I don’t like to interrupt.” “Well, you’re young, you may get over that yet.” “How do you know I’m young?” “My sister-in-law is young.” “Twenty-three is young?” “On second thought, I’ve no idea. You’d have to get back to me in ten years with the answer.” “Maggie said you’re working on some kind of melancholia project?” Jean paused and, interpreting the lack of response as assent, went on. “Well, as it happens, I didn’t know Saint well. I don’t have any special insight into why he died. Not a peep from his family. Nobody in the office was invited to the memorial. He worked here briefly. Of course, when a young person dies, people are bound to wonder if it was purposeful or a terrible accident. But I only know that it made me sad. Very sad. The days got quieter for a while, but already they seem more regular again.” “Do you not feel changed by his death?” “It’s hard to say. Maybe I will feel more changed by it in a week or even a year. Actually, I can tell you how I feel at this very moment. I don’t feel changed except that I feel things must change now, and I didn’t feel that way before.” “Things in your life, you mean?” “Yes, I think—do I have the right idea about your novel? You’re writing about someone suffering from depression, or who doesn’t want to live.” “In a sense.” “Then why ask about my life?” “I would rather keep talking and not tell you.” “But I would like to know.” “All right. The protagonist of the novel is a popular writer—but not a known one—from a troubled background. He does suffer a breakdown, a deep depression, but it’s for a surprising reason. Or I hope it’s surprising. Someone he’d never thought about before or been intimate with, a colleague very much on the periphery of his life, disappears. And it sets off all these changes in him, which the people who have a financial interest in his functioning sanity try to subdue. The protagonist has some careless tendencies, mind you. He disappears from peoples’ lives all the time. Maybe the idea is terribly obvious and you can see where all this is going.” “No, I can’t. I mean, I can’t see where the story is going. But if I didn’t know any better I’d say you were questioning me about my own mental state, not the circumstances of Saint’s death. I am the one who has of late suffered an absence.” “That’s right. Like I said, I get curious about people sometimes. I apologize if my approach alarmed you.” He seemed, to Jean, to leave so much out. She found herself wanting to take a step closer. Her phone was pressed to her right ear and her whole body was inclined that way, as if she were speaking to a man just on the other side of a wall. “Strangely, I don’t feel offended at all,” she said. “Maybe I don’t have enough mysterious callers in my life. Or mysterious Tellers. But, look, I don’t want you using what I say about myself in your book.” “You mean that I shouldn’t ask you about your life anymore.” “I mean that... that you should call me anytime, if you have any further use for me.” The Reader, by Ellen Akimoto © The artist. Courtesy Galerie Rothamel, Erfurt, Germany As soon as she got back to her boss’s parents’ apartment, Jean began stripping off articles of clothing, one after another, taking care to crumple each item into a ball and fling it toward her bed as if it were a piece of garbage. Already it seemed that the memory of Saint had begun to fade, that she was shedding her light mourning garments in order to replace him at the center of Teller’s story. Angie appeared in the doorway wearing a chenille blanket like a cape over her Norma Kamali bodysuit. Jean could see the shape of her hand beneath the blanket picking at a dry patch of skin around her collarbone. “How was work?” “Fine. Your sister’s being kind of a bitch.” “God, yes, thank you! What did she do now?” Jean savored this moment in which she might have dished about Maggie and her husband’s superficial interest in Saint’s death, Teller’s weird insistence on speaking with her, the possible implementation of office yoga in the not-so-distant future. It would be sweet relief from the day to slip into silky, conspiratorial chitchat. Besides, what she wanted to get into concerned Angie more than it did almost anyone else, and didn’t they talk about whatever was preoccupying them? Then her mind danced over the discarded scraps of paper. She pictured them assembled into a clean surface that would shout appalling words if only it had a mouth. “Nothing,” replied Jean. “Literally nothing. I get fed up working there sometimes.” “It’s so fake, right?” “Totally. Being there reminds me of kindergarten arts and crafts. It’s supposed to be all fun and creative, but we have no control over our lives when we’re there. I had to watch Norma Desmond all day because Jonathan fucking checked out. Maybe he’s having an affair.” “What makes you say that?” “Nothing,” said Jean, who had only thought of it in that moment. “I just find the idea funny.” “Well, I wouldn’t hook up with him. He’s like fifty and I find the fact that he works for my sister super emasculating. But I must admit he’s clever. All those crazy writers he coddles. He really figured out life—he never had to stop being a babysitter. And in a way, that’s the dream.” Teller called again three days later, and again two days after that. Both times Maggie had been out at lunch. Do married people always know when their spouse is eating their lunch? Jean wondered. It thrilled her to think he was carving out a time in the day just for them. She wasn’t sure she had any affection for the voice, but she looked forward to how it broke the workday into pieces. The voice was her favorite task to complete. She didn’t presume that it took any particular pleasure in its encounters with her voice. It maintained a consistent tenor: asking, listening, explaining. “What’s up?” “Nothing’s up. Every day I work on my novel.” “I’d ask you to tell me more about it, but I’m sure it’s, like, ‘top secret.’” “Between us, it’s neither ‘top’ nor ‘secret.’ I’ll tell you the idea, if you’d like.” “I already said I would.” “And you’re allowed to laugh. Actually, please do. Deep breath. The year is 2045.” “That is funny!” “I like to open with a bit of dark humor. Waters are encroaching, coastal cities are sinking, war isn’t officially spreading, but violence is. Safety is the rarest of commodities, more precious than drinkable water, healthy food, education. The wealthy and professional classes have of course been spared the worst of it, and the worse the world gets, the better they feel by comparison. When the well-off feel bad, they tend to think about how terrible other peoples’ lives are, and this causes them to feel great happiness. Which is another way of saying they take pleasure in the pain of others. The expedient relations between empathy and sadism, the possibility that the two words might name the same feeling, is a large theme in the book. The protagonist, Charlie, is a screenwriter, a really successful one. He writes blockbuster movies and bingeable TV shows, and he’s been bought by one of those big streamers, Amazon but not. Disney Plus One. Well, Charlie has a mental breakdown. It seems to have been prompted by the disappearance of an assistant at the streamer’s legal department with whom he has interacted on occasion for a couple of years. Aside from that, the persistent problems in his life continue to dog him. He has an anti-authority streak and can’t stand that he’s sold out. He hates the police, and the superheroes he writes about who work with them. His mom died when he was young and his dad has been incarcerated in a mental health facility for twenty years, which makes even the fact of the breakdown particularly fraught. He’s unmarried, no girlfriends, no family he’s close with. Friends stick with him but enable whatever it is he wants to get into, which inevitably carries him away from them again. In the midst of all this psychic upheaval, the studio he’s obligated to serve asks him to write a script for a remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, an adaptation so loose it will obviate the need to buy rights to the book and make it easy to promote some of the company’s other products and values throughout the film. Management wants the project to home in on the individuality and adventurous spirits of the characters. Also, in embarking on this grand adventure, the denizens of this screenplay are discovering their own solutions to climate change, rather than whining to their elected representatives or blowing up pipelines. In short, they are men of their times and men for their times. Except that the Dr.Aronnax character will be played by a woman, to promote the idea that women can be in charge of their destinies too, and to diffuse any potential for homoerotic subtext. The studio has tentatively titled the project The French Canadian. Or Sea of Rogues. But my novel will be called The End of Charlie.” Teller paused. “Do you like that title?” “It’s good, has a certain gravitas. Although between you and me I sometimes wish that novels would have more mundane titles.” “For instance?” “I don’t know, maybe something like Stop Doing That, The Countertop I Bumped Into, You’re Sitting on My Hair, Hold My Baby. But please go on.” “Okay, very much noted. The last one was directed at me, yes?” “It was.” “The production company, always mindful of its bottom line and endeavoring to eke profit out of any opportunity, even a mental health crisis, proposes to book Charlie a week on a submarine spa, a wellness trend that has recently caught on, what with all the strictures on travel and veiled genocides over resource shortages. Once there, Charlie will receive counseling, kelp body wraps, massages, and immersion tank therapy, all in an atmosphere conducive to researching and writing.” “You should call it Submarine Island.” “I’m well aware you’re better at titles than I am.” “So does he make it to the spa?” “Yes, in fact, the novel is almost entirely set there and—” “I don’t need to hear more. I like it. Tons of potential. Is it written yet?” “Just the first draft, which is limp and unfeeling, which is what needs changing. But come on, if I knew you’d be this facetious about it, do you think I’d have bared my soul like that?” Jean started giggling, waited for him to scold her, but he was really the most patient of Tellers. “Sorry,” she said. “‘It sounds brilliant’ is really what I should have said up front. I’m laughing because it sounds like a book Angie would like.” “If she ever got around to reading it. Remember how she hates my guts? Not to mention my personality.” “That’s precisely why it’s so funny! She loves Jules Verne, did you know that?” She wanted to add, Did you know she falls into depressions all the time over the tiniest details? At least they seem tiny to me, but I know not to dwell on the scale of her disturbances. And did you know the pain of hating one’s own self fascinates her as well, that she succumbs to it all too often? She went on. “I guess I’ll have to be the one to read it. I guess it’s inevitable I’d read something of yours eventually. I’ll pick it up whenever it comes out in paperback.” “Why don’t I send you a few pages this evening?” “Really?” “Sure.” “But why?” “Because you sound honest, beneath the sarcasm. And you’re not a stalker, blogger, hanger-on-er, my editor, my wife, or obsessed with me.” “All right. How about a friend then?” “A friend.” On her belly with her feet in the air, Jean was gazing for the hundredth time at the lower rungs of Angie’s bookshelf, which lined nearly an entire wall of her bedroom. This position allowed her to examine the greatest number of books, since several more were gathered in fat teetering piles on the floor. “I just realized I’m being a bookworm,” she shouted at Angie, who was lying on the bed with her laptop open on her stomach. “I’m being a revolting little bookworm crawling across your floor looking for my next great read. Isn’t it pathetic? Don’t you just want to squish me with your beautifully manicured feet?” “No. You know I hate feet!” “Oh my god, they’re your own feet!!” Angie slammed her laptop shut and sat up. “Want me to help you pick something out?” “That’d be great.” “Cool. I’m really gonna curate this experience for you,” she proclaimed, dangling her fingers by her face, like she was making a tiny marionette walk nowhere. “What are you in the mood for? Give me, like, three words to go off of. Any part of speech.” “I don’t know.” “Not good enough. Just say the first three words that come into your head.” “That’s a lot of pressure!” “Is it? Just give me one word.” “Um.” “Yes?” “Um.” “First word that comes into your head. Come on, you were just speaking in complete sentences five seconds ago.” “Well, okay, um—worm?” Angie stared at Jean with blatant disgust, then blinked hard. “Is that really what you want to be saying, Jean? You want me to curate for you some literature inspired by ‘worm.’ Is this what you’re telling me?” Jean sat up straight, too, on the floor, and made a show of gathering her composure. “That’s a good point, Angie, a really good point. I don’t want my reading experience brought to me by ‘worm.’ What if I tell you, instead, what I don’t like to read. I’ll keep listing stuff until you tell me to stop and we can take it from there.” Jean had the sensation of throwing sopping red meat to a starving dog. “Yes, amazing. Okay, then go: what do you not like to read?” “All right. I’m taking a deep breath, because none of this will be easy for you to hear. So, for starters”—for dramatic effect, Jean paused for almost a full minute, which Angie, in her hyper-attentive state, seemed not to notice at all—“I don’t like English detective novels.” “Really?! But have you read—” “I don’t like American detective fiction either.” “REALLY?” “And I don’t like adventures at sea. Actually I don’t like any plots that involve boats.” “What the fuck, you can’t be fucking serious—” “I don’t like stories set in the suburbs. Or the future.” “How are those things even related in your mind, like—” “And I don’t like leather jacket stories.” “What, you mean expensively bound litra-ture?” “You know perfectly well that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about the kind of story that sounds like a man in a leather jacket is explaining the most mundane details of his day to a person he considers an idiot. The clouds moved, the heart pumped blood, the stoplights flipped interminably red and green. It’s overly complicated about simple things and dribbles casual down-and-out effrontery all over the carpet. It’s a map drawn to show someone how to keep breathing.” “Oh yeah, like, I was having one of those days. I went to the gathering on Henry Street and met a guy named Henry who didn’t know my name, so I told him. Everyone milled about drinking and barely eating anything. Models snorting coke in the corner (I asymptotically approached). Editors telling me they meant to read that piece I wrote. An artist with a surprisingly grateful disposition. You know, a party.” “Yes, exactly, like, I just came out this way, with too many guns in the glove compartment. I mean violent: a silver spoon in my mouth and the steering wheel of a ’67 Ford Mustang between my two chubby baby arms. Born for a road apart, a dying streak of no-good luck, sinister only-child energy, like a guy who sneers at Christmas movies then gets mad when his mom buys him the wrong kind of coffee machine.” Angie butted in. “I thought about my Dutchess of Houston Street all day long, lost in her fragrant blond hair, her honeysuckle nose job. So gone was I that it wasn’t until I hit Seventy-second and Lex that I even realized I’d walked straight through the glass door of a CVS. Luckily I’d stopped in there to buy Band-Aids. Okay, now can you tell me one kind of story you do like? Just name one and I’ll lay a nice little stack at your... er... feet.” “I don’t know.” “Come on! I’ll just say it then: you enjoy those desperate little books about women who can’t make up their minds about anything.” Jean stared at the edge of the mattress. She didn’t feel like looking Angie in the face anymore. It was true she’d read dozens of these books. And even when she went to a used-book store and picked out something on a whim, because she liked the cover or the first sentences, it usually ended up being one of those. Even when she bought a book by a man. She’d encountered these stories so often they’d begun to feel like fairy tales about women who were girls, even when they were lousy with alcohol, sex, and loneliness. The girl who writhed in the web of her bedsheets, walked the streets trawling for impressions. Always she seemed to drag a net behind her, a beautiful net through which everything one day passed. A provisional figure. The desirable first sketch of a woman, poised like a piece of scaffolding with no distinct desires of her own. “I mean, you have excellent taste,” continued Angie. “I love those books, too, as you know.” Jean met her eyes again and exhaled a light puff of laughter. “Yes, but lately I just don’t know. I read them compulsively. And when I put them down I feel as if I’m more where I am than I was when I started. Perhaps I will try reading some other kind of book next.” He felt day by day as if he were building himself a machine for endless sinking. A dreamcraft that follows blind the subterranean currents. This machine whose sole purpose was to one day touch the ocean floor, as a child suddenly finds he can grasp the higher branch of a tree, in fact never reached it. Meanwhile the sea itself seemed to deepen hopelessly, like shadows do as the day creeps onward. Walter [the German spa worker who gives Charlie rough massages during his time on board] had remarked that he was lucky enough to have a sense of days passing at all. But Charlie couldn’t remember when he had said that, only that the room had been dim, which was meant to relax him. He realized that he’d begun to speak of “days” as a matter of habit. The sacred tradition of apportioning hours no longer applied. It was the centuries that seemed to escape him, not the hours. The clocks needn’t tell the truth, for he knew it in his bones: These were dark times, the darkest he’d known. He’d stopped turning off his light at night. Jean hadn’t heard Angie come in from her date with Frank but saw the door to her room pull shut. A wave of shocked sickness washed over her, as if she’d just seen the tail of a giant lizard disappear around the corner. Angie had grown unnaturally quiet, signaling to Jean that she was in one of her darker moods. Jean closed her laptop and followed. She found Angie standing in the corner of her room, leaning against a tower of books. “I left some pasta in the fridge for you,” said Jean. Angie thanked her with relief in her voice but stayed rooted in the spot. Then she was suddenly kneeling on the bed with her hands in her hair. Jean could see she had begun to cry, or had ceased not-crying, as her skin already had a redness to it. She moaned that it was about Frank, who had not shown up for their date and wasn’t responding to her messages. “It’s over,” Angie said. “This is his way of saying so.” But it didn’t seem like she believed it. In her friend’s eyes Jean could see abandonment taking on dozens of shades, tying her further to his vision, to a world colored by him. It would take a long time for this attraction to die. And then, of course, he could always come back. “It’ll be all right,” said Jean, without much conviction. “You don’t understand.” “Don’t be silly.” “No, listen. You’re a responsible person with this intense focus. You’re strong and hardworking. You don’t lose yourself in games as I do.” “Hardly. I mean, can’t you tell what I am? If I had a free roof over my head or any unearned money, do you think I’d even have this job? I work to have one thing settled, and that’s money, but I don’t know what I want. Sometimes I think that without work I’d slide right off the face of the earth, sever all ties, absorb myself in literature, and the dwindling embers of my own personal intrigues, and the ‘personal life’ sections of Wikipedia entries, and TikTok, until there was nothing left of me. I would be like a perfectly transparent piece of glass standing treacherously at the edge of a cliff with nothing but lovely views on either side.” “Bored is the last thing,” said Jean. “The list is long. Most of all I love you, so please don’t believe those things you say.” Angie cried quietly with her head down. Jean thought she looked beautiful and went to sit beside her friend on the bed, locking an arm around her shoulder. Up close Jean could see that her face was covered in irregular splotches. Her neck and some of her hair was wet. Jean thought that she would not like to be seen this way. Such tears were unrefined and predictable, big sloppy movie star tears. It also made Jean feel guilty, this inability to repress her hatefulness. “Have you noticed,” continued Angie, “how on news programs when the pundits want to be clever and cutting they say that a political opponent of theirs ‘just said the quiet part out loud’?” “Yeah, I know. It’s a cliché.” “And we hate clichés.” “Well yeah that’s, like, rule number one. Don’t use them,” Jean said, reaching with her free hand to shove a cascading lock of Angie’s hair behind her ear. “And don’t be one.” “I’m confused, though. If we’re all saying the quiet part out loud, is that then the loud part, too? Or would the loud part be all the stuff we’re not saying?” “I think it’s the stuff we were once saying to pretend like we were well-adjusted people, without prejudice or complex or fear.” “Could it be all the screaming people do, but only when they think nobody could possibly be listening?” “The screaming they do in front of people, more like.” “The member of a couple who never shuts the hell up.” “That would be you.” “It’s only my generosity,” protested Angie. “I give you so many chances to ridicule me, because I know it’s what you like to do.” “I won’t argue with that.” “No, sometimes you let me win a few rounds, too.” “That’s me,” said Jean, snuggling into a corner of the bed, waiting for sleep to take her by the head and drag her away. When he called her again the office was especially empty, and Jean had stopped paying attention to her work, gladly letting her thoughts wander. It was the end of March, and writers were crawling out from their hovels to take meetings in person at cafés. Even Norma Desmond would occasionally go for a walk during writing hours, which felt like real progress. They’d hired an intern to share the pit in the middle of the office with Jean, but his cat was sick, and he was working from home to take care of her. On the phone, Jean was reticent at first, and she thought the voice could sense it. She asked it questions to further deflect from herself. “What do you do when you’re stuck?” “Well, nothing, obviously... ” “Haha. You know what I mean. What you do to get unstuck.” “With writing, you mean?” “However you’d like to answer me.” “All right, I’ll answer you like this: When I’m stuck I start paying attention to my dreams.” “You mean you interpret them?” “No, I never interpret, never analyze. With dreams that’s deadly. I simply write them down, read them over, and revise them. After a few days I begin to remember them more frequently, in greater detail, and I record elaborations until I hit a wall. Before long I’m dreaming in narratives rather than images. Then the narratives begin popping up in my conscious thoughts too. I’m still writing them down and reading them, like a painter going over the same part of the canvas repeatedly, creating texture, color, light, and gradually a larger picture emerges, I accept life more easily, my moods whistle by like lost steam. If it’s really going well then I am like the painting or the novel itself, which feels nothing. I have all the equilibrium of the medium.” “I don’t remember my dreams,” said Jean, sighing. “Perhaps you should try. They can be so compelling. The other night, for instance, I had a dream about you.” “You did?” “Yes, is that strange?” “No,” said Jean softly, then, recovering a boldness in her voice, added, “Perhaps I dream about you, too, and don’t even know it. It could be that I’m a cowardly dreamer. But I’d like to hear your dream.” “If it won’t bore you, I’ll tell you.” “It won’t.” “All right then. You were sitting at your desk in an office. It was just like the office you really work in, only there was more of it, more desks surrounding yours, more offices behind the glass doors on the far walls, and there were many levels. You could look down from one floor and see everyone below, like the lobby of the New York City Ballet. But you were on the lowest level, and I only focused on you.” “You’ve been to my office before?” “Once, many years ago. I came in disguise.” “Was that really necessary?” “I thought so. Nobody actually wants to see me anyway, whatever the gossips say. It would ruin their image of me, which is all that most people care about. Better for me to be a text.” “Interesting.” “May I go on?” “Please.” And so Teller did, delicately. “I couldn’t see what you were working on, only that you worked strenuously, in service to powerful interests. There were no computers in this office. Everything was done with paper, and there were reams of written documents strewn across your desk. You were only ever preoccupied with a single piece of paper at a time, but you devoted every iota of your attention to it, and it was excruciating to imagine the effort it would take for you to get through all the chaotic piles one page at a time. Slowly you turned from one paper to the next, occasionally jotting something down, immensely competent, never interrupting your focus for a moment.” “Is that all?” “No, there’s more. My focus on you was similarly intense, unbreakable, and as I continued to stare I noticed there were men all over the office who were staring at you, too. Beneath their gaze I noted that your clothes had become slick with sweat and your nipples had grown hard. You had been dressed modestly for work, in a knee-length cotton dress with a boat neck, but because it was sticking to you it no longer concealed your body. Still, you remained completely absorbed in your task. Men began to gather around you, some were playing with themselves, but you never looked up from your papers until finally your boss—a faceless man with a protruding belly tucked into a seedy brown suit—ordered you into his office. He said, ‘This won’t do!’ and demanded that you remove your dress. You obeyed passively, revealing that you were wearing a bra but no panties. Some of the women in the office began to congregate by the glass door of the boss’s suite. Most looked judgmental, a few desiring, as their faces pressed closer and closer to the glass. Everyone in the office had their eyes on you, including your boss, who looked perplexed, as if he’d never been faced with a situation where all of the company’s resources were being wasted at once. You, at least, needed to work, to pick up the slack. The pages of your boss’s daybook were splayed across his desk, and he barked at you to finish them off. Without so much as a nod you got on the desk, straddled the papers, and began dragging yourself across them. The papers became wet wherever you touched them. It seemed you couldn’t possibly finish them all.” “Then what?” said Jean with a dry throat. “There is no more. You remained there, surrounded by your colleagues, just as focused as you’d ever been.” “I never left?” “No, you stayed in that room all night.” Maggie came in from lunch. Jean caught her eye and could feel herself flush. Her skin was damp and vibrated in the chilly office air. “Gotta go, lunch is over,” said Jean, hanging up. She stared with a twisted smile at an article on her computer screen as Maggie made her way over. Maggie often passed Jean’s desk on her way to her own, only this time she stopped and beamed down at her. “You look so happy,” said Maggie, with a winking demeanor. “May I ask who you were talking to?” “Your sister,” said Jean. A week later, Jean and Angie were sitting in an almost empty restaurant on the Upper West Side on a Saturday at noon. The only other customers in the huge, ornate space were a couple of spiffy tourists loudly discussing hockey. “Why would you bring me here?” murmured Angie. “I’ve lived in this neighborhood my whole life and have never been here. I could have gone on that way until the bitter end. The color scheme is sunset over Liberace’s hot tub, and some of the light fixtures are shaped like curly fries. Are the water glasses carved from obsidian? Even sitting here at this very moment I am not sure this place exists at all.” In truth, Jean had chosen the restaurant because it looked anonymous and dark from the outside. She admonished herself for allowing the plum-colored curtains to sucker her in. She had intuited from television shows that real adults delivered potentially hurtful or compromising information in neutral territory, like a coffee shop with a liquor license, which is kind of what she’d thought this would be. But the coffee was awful. “What I really can’t understand though,” continued Angie, “is why you’re telling me this in broad fucking daylight, like I’m your... your errand... not even a friend, much less your closest friend, but, rather, a professional fucking obligation.” “It doesn’t have anything to do with you,” Jean repeated stoically. Angie’s breathing was slow and deliberate; she picked at her lip until it bled then dabbed at it unconsciously with a white cloth napkin. “Jean, this is my family, my history, my past. If it really has nothing to do with me, why are you even telling me?” “Because I tell you everything.” “Nobody tells anyone everything. This is carefully selected information. You didn’t tell me you’ve been flirting with my brother-in-law at any point in the past two months, for instance. Why? Because I despise him? Because my sister’s a dolt but she’s still my sister? Where are you even meeting him?” “At a hotel.” Angie’s voice became louder, more frantic. “Jean, I despise him, you know this. He takes people away from me and I’m afraid he’ll take you too. I feel like a dog waiting for his owner to come home. Anyone but him. Please don’t do it.” “Is he taking me away from you or am I the one taking him away? You have this fantasy of him as hateful that you can’t bear to see disproven. Maybe you even secretly want him to like you. Anyway, I’m sick of talking about it.” Angie said nothing. “I’m sick of talking,” Jean repeated. “You don’t even have a job. In the real world you couldn’t buy groceries.” “I know,” said Angie, slowly, like she was churning the words through a meat grinder, “that I depend on other people. That I depend on you. Don’t you depend on me?” But Jean’s eyes had grown rigid in her skull as the chill of resolve took hold. She saw the weakness in her friend, her vulnerability unwanted and embarrassing, like a bride at a crime scene. Angie had demanded her soothing words, her counsel, her time, yet she fell apart when Jean paid attention to someone she hardly knew. Jean had no qualms about what she was doing. Any court of law would acknowledge her argument as airtight. Yet somehow it was Angie’s desperation that most incensed her. She explained in a gallant tone that she was nothing like Angie, that she enjoyed people’s company, or hated it, but she did not depend on it. Anyone who hadn’t been handed their life on a silver platter might feel the same. It was then that a speck of substance, like iron, lodged itself in Angie’s chest and slowed her racing heart. Some time slipped by without words, just the coffee turning cold. But her body was bright and alive. The damage hardly seemed irreparable. In fact she suddenly had to suppress a laugh, one that would fill the palatial room with the playful ringing of her voice. She had a clean, melodic way of speaking and could carry a tune. She was very young and perhaps she was about to not be anymore. Contentedly she faced her serious, tormented friend, who stared back at her with the countenance of a regal portrait, impatient to be done with all this sitting around. Angie was, too, in her way. She wanted to see what would happen next. Waking up alone in a room, perhaps far from her friend. She would reenact her nights less often, and let the days feel too long, keeping more of her vision intact for the next viewing. She did not recognize herself in these future moments. Who imagines happiness? How was it that even now it blossomed like an exotic flower in her mouth and kept her tongue at peace? In the evening, after they’d sat in silence and settled up, sheepishly placing a few crumpled bills on the table as if they were gold ingots, Angie returned to her parents’ apartment, Jean to their place in Brooklyn. The righteousness Jean had possessed at the restaurant was already gone. It was not only righteousness that eluded her now, but her very sense of possessiveness, which drained from her more and more by the hour. Her brain wouldn’t stop replaying their meeting, and each time Angie’s face seemed to her more exuberant. Jean didn’t want to think of Angie at all. Even if she had deceived her, surely Angie would have done the same in her place and maybe it was even for her own good. Still, her mood continued to wane. Anxiety encroached. Jean wanted to square Angie with her thoughts, trap her within four walls and set her aside, and if that didn’t work, she would draw a line through her, toss her away. Angie was as flimsy and defenseless as a piece of paper besieged by words. How delicate a page is, how surmountable. If one went through life divinely lucid it would be easy to take any one of them in hand and shred it, or overcome it with even more words, each more masterful than the last. It was this divine state that Jean aspired to, although she felt as if she were sinking into the floor. There is a blank page, and a page with very little written on it, most of it unreasonable, a page that would only make sense to a few people, those in the right mood to receive it. Most would say that it isn’t worth anything until it’s been ripped up or flooded with those divinely powerful words, and that it is right to be wary, even ashamed, of the emptiness. And yet there’s no advice in the world that can protect someone from this agonizing choice: destroy the pages and become one thing, hold onto them and become something else. That night Jean was completely in thrall to her dreams, as if drugged on them. She was in a large, dark room with high ceilings she’d never seen before but which she intuited was hers. She loved the room desperately and felt at home in it. But the room was on fire. She saw unassuming sparks burst forth hungrily into flames, showing her more of the room as they devoured it. Heartache and fear oozed through her bloodstream, but there was no way out, and it had never occurred to her to find one. The room was filled with everything Jean loved: the people, objects, memories, emotions. As the fire raged around her she witnessed it all burn away, although not a single artifact of her life cried out to her as it died, and this tortured her beyond comprehension, yet she didn’t cry out either, or make a single sound. Finally, all that remained was the corner of a little brown blanket she often wrapped around herself as she read or wrote in her journal on the couch in Brooklyn. Angie had brought it from her parents’ place for her when she’d complained about their apartment being too cold. Sometimes a weekend afternoon would be perfect: the words in the novel she was reading felt bracingly truthful about the most wretched parts of life, like an old friend, Angie had filled the Instant Pot with a questionable stew, and the blanket absorbed all the sun as it careened through the window. “Must this go, too?” said Jean to the darkness. “Can’t I at least keep this?” But it burned away before she’d finished speaking, so that it seemed to her the words were the last to go into the fire. And with that the fire extinguished itself, the light left, and the anguished decreation of all things subsided. But the pain didn’t burn up the way the words, the objects, or even the fire had. The pain was a certainty beyond language that her world had come to an end; no more warmth, no more memory, no more love. The pain was in her body, but it was not of her flesh, because it had a body of its own. Once all her former intimacies had vanished, it had entered her as casually as a stranger lifting the latch of a front gate. And now this pain encircled her heart as if gripping the handle of a dagger poised to murder her without leaving any outward sign of distress.

        "story": "I have no pictures of people on my phone anymore, she said, only pictures of prose. When did I become a misanthrope? The last time he saw her, she was wearing the same dress she’d worn the day the affair began. He thought of that dress. She thought of the hurt. No pictures of either, really. She had to scroll back quite some ways to find faces. They made their first (last) appearance circa that last time they’d spoken. So this was a clue. Before that, people. After, novels: mentions of chrysanthemums, butterflies, an opera box. Here was a scene in which an off-duty actor slaps the proprietor with a lavender glove... she read the first bit aloud, then trailed off. A whole year’s worth. So that’s what she’d been up to. What did it say, this careful collection of non-humanoid excerpts— An increased chance of dying alone, he joked. On her end, the sirens began to sound. The general consensus regarding the conflict raging outside was this: Someone would win. Then life would return to the way it was before. A very few would have quite a lot; a very many, not much at all. The civilian population stayed in and waited for the insurgents and the government to sort it out; i.e., they did as they were told. Meanwhile they logged in. Logged on. Looked into their screens. Unwrapped food rations marked with insurgent symbols in districts the insurgents controlled, government insignias in the government zones. They stood at the windows, a safe step back from the panes, and watched the drones and searchlights spar. They sat in stairwells and called old lovers they’d formerly sworn off. For it seemed life had slowed down enough for almost everything to be forgiven. The subway was empty. The restaurants, closed. The streets were quieter than they’d ever been, people said again and again; on an unsecured line it was hard to come up with anything else to talk about. For a while, between the hours of noon and five, you could still walk down the block to the salon for powdered shampoo and razors, where they were also selling cigarettes. Then the hours of free movement slendered down to a thin band of light and disappeared: perpetual night. There was no such thing as curfew anymore. It was all the time. The risk of either asking to see the other, rekindle the relationship, had been thus eliminated. In other ways, life hadn’t changed. For her. For him. She was a playwright. He was a playwright. The theaters were always the first thing to go. She said, Maybe we should write some monologues. He was on speakerphone as she scrolled. The stairwell was alive with the after-fizz of disinfectant. She sat at the top, tucked up under the roof, twirling the end of her braid between forefinger and thumb. She wondered if he did other things while they talked, absentminded tasks like cleaning the counter, stewing a chicken, making soup. One could harmonize with these distractions. They were intimate chores to be completed in the presence of someone you loved. When she heard the clack of the keyboard, her heart sank. As for typing emails, transcripts; refreshing the news—these tasks were discordant with reconciliation. She might as well hang up. For his part, he didn’t imagine her to be doing anything at all, because he knew exactly where she was. She’d described the stairwell in great detail, down to the convex skylight overhead. He could picture her, and accurately: spotlit, on the linoleum, slumped. Her face, propped against the railing, was obscured by a stiff veil of unwashed fringe. The bangs quivered in the gust of a door collapsing on a pressurized hinge, the narrowing gap resisting until that last moment when— I think this building used to be a school, she said. What he’d loved about the woman, he was reminded, was this space she left between what she said and what she meant. He liked a buffer zone. Standing in his kitchen, polishing the steel countertop while the kettle rumbled on the burner, prepping a cup of tea he already regretted and did not want, he pressed the phone to his ear and reflected that this quality reproduced in her the same power as a play: you sat safely back from the struggles onstage. He didn’t see so many plays anymore, of course. Nobody did. These days, he mostly watched YouTube clips of classical musicians. He chose a passage—the cello ascension, say, the grand stairwell entrance, to the center of Bach’s suites—and watched many cellists attempt it, one after the next. He ranked them on a Post-it secured to his desk. And he watched her. In his mind. That dress she used to wear was a high blue color with long tight sleeves, the kind of conservative garment that nevertheless immediately called to mind how difficult it must be to get on or, more to the point, off. He’d appreciated that. He ripped open a package of tea. (What’s that sound? she asked. My latest vice, he replied; before the curfew he’d collected quite a stash.) He sometimes wondered if they’d made a mistake, separating themselves. Though it was hard to say what was a mistake, what wasn’t, when everything ended in disappointment anyway. That’s how he’d wound up with so much tea, really—you get sick of a flavor and abandon the box. This was his belief. So it was more about how much time they might have spent, but hadn’t. He steeped his unwanted—he checked the label—Darjeeling. Terrible substitute for nicotine. It was terrible to quit. He wondered what even was the point of soldiering on. Out the window, the searchlights sliced through one another, illuminating the slats of fire escapes. He could see a shadowed figure across the way, another shape in the yellow light, someone also making tea, thinking, reverse engineering how they might have lived. The age gap between him and the woman on the line stretched nearly twenty years. She was too young to remember the last time war broke out. He drew the frilled demi-curtain along the rod. The apartment was full of ironic feminine kitsch like this. Cotton eyelet in the kitchen. A hip-high vase at the door. There were antique advertisements for nylons, framed, in the bath, details that seemed at once an appeal to the fairer sex and also a light joke at his exes’ expense: after they left, domestic life went on. The stair landing on which the woman sat, meanwhile, or so she was now explaining, was a revolving furniture exchange—one of those computer chairs had once belonged to her. The purpose was stated right there on the wall with a little handmade sign: carousel of exchange. And yet, despite the sundry furnishings, she sat on the floor, on the top step. It was neatly done, the way the man had staged it in his mind, and not so far from the truth, as he and the woman would both have been pleased to know. It is a fantasy too often underestimated, to be guessed at correctly through the presumption of stage directions: [Spotlight. Woman seated at edge of stage, feet dangling into orchestra pit to simulate stairs; alternatively, elevated, stage left, visible railing, against which she rests head. Presses phone to ear. Secondhand furniture scattered. Lots of it. Broken chairs. A real junkyard. Possibly a candlestick.] [Woman touches her hair. Stands up. Looks out the barred window and spins a chair.] SHE: Do you know that story, the one with the toboggan and the two kids, the boy and the girl, and he takes her every day to the top of a hill, it’s snowing, and they sled down three times, one, two, three, they’re at some dacha somewhere, I think it’s Chekhov—one sec, I have it on my phone, or never mind, it takes too long to find—anyway, he’s sitting behind her, arms around her, and each time they descend, he whispers in her ear, I love you, Nadya, just quietly enough that she can’t be sure she heard it, and at the bottom of the hill, when she asks him what he said, he says, What are you even talking about, so she lets him drag her back to the top, even though she hates sledding, she’s terrified, the hill is too steep, because the whole time she’s trying to decide, Was it him, or was it the wind? [Beat.] HE: The rule of threes, I know it, sure. But at least I never dragged you up hills. She sat back down on the stairs, returned to scrolling through the collection of passages on her phone. Her face was blanched by the screen, the walls by the light pollution that burned off in the night to settle, like ash, through the skylight. She slid back up to the passage with the lavender glove. SHE: It’s the lavender that makes it Nabokov’s. A compromise between the slapstick and the lovely. [Beat.] SHE: The problem is I have no audience for these observations. [Stage right: Man takes cloth and mimes polishing a countertop, stops. Examines his hand.] SHE: I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’ve been thinking lately about whether I should have gone in for women. HE: Well, I’m definitely the right audience for that. Outside, the sirens sounded again. Maybe all drama reduces to a siren’s call: there’s something in a person that craves catastrophe. The little ticket-taker in everyone longs for hiatus, release, the distant crash of buildings tumbling down, perhaps even not so distant, but just far enough away to still keep safe while last century’s rubble is pulped. The slow disaster unfolding outside whets the appetite for more. Six of one, half dozen. Between two tyrants, you find yourself psychologically predisposed to the one who’s not yet let you down. A last push against the door of the imagination, and then it is ajar, exposing scenes beyond the current desertion of the streets: your own building, halved, the small world of your room revealed, like a woman stripped, to the no one left who’s looking in. Squint into the sun. There, the end. You don’t admit thoughts like these. You catch them reflected in the periphery, in the opera glasses glinting in the darkened mezzanine. Not political enough, Nadya... The weird ghost arrives, escaped from a pamphlet, a newspaper, something else she’s read—But no, it’s just the hiss and crash of the pressurized door in the stairwell again. The real reason she’d called was to discuss the question of loyalty. There was a war on, after all. One was naturally preoccupied with taking sides. And yet she found she still wanted to please, primarily, this person on the other end of the line. She’d played many roles over the years, never quite able to shake the sense that she was in fact performing for someone offstage, and that her life was therefore misdirected. This audience was present even in her most private moments, observing what she ordered on a dinner date, what she did in bed. It watched her pin up bits of dialogue on note cards to organize her thoughts. There was some satisfaction, at least, in thinking that perhaps she’d made of him a muse. Not everyone found one. So, that was their loss. The world had been wrung of ancientness, made practical, was too afraid of running into itself to indulge in clichés like these. SHE (to the audience, whispering): He always did have a special way of making me feel ashamed. HE: What? SHE: Nothing, nothing. NEIGHBOR 1 (stage left, lowering pair of binoculars, sinking behind tin trash can): I think they’re finally losing it. “Memory, Chernowitz,” by Boris Savelev Down three flights of stairs, the building accordioned per city regulation, the facade jutting stepwise in and out to maximize access to light. Across the niche from the woman’s apartment, her neighbors liked to keep track of her progress: she studied her note cards, pasted papers to the wall. They observed one another brushing their teeth, painting toenails, steeping the coffee, and dressing for work. There was no need to dress for work or maintain pedicures anymore, but they half-dressed all the same, made the coffee, filed the corns. The neighbors couldn’t have known the woman was writing plays, of course. That was part of the intrigue. Tit for tat: she watched them, too. What did they do, for example, in that apartment two floors above, where they always kept the red light on? Where did one even find such light bulbs? She’d googled it once: bulb red free shipping District 31. The couple was downstairs in the ruby light right now, looking through the reddish pall into the woman’s empty studio. Where could she possibly have gone? To the stairs, that’s where, and where she was still trying to train her thoughts on logically compatible conclusions. She glanced around her at the walls of the former school. She hadn’t spent much time on this landing before, had visited only once or twice, when she’d had a guest and needed an extra seat, or else had an extra seat (that abominable computer chair that bucked and squeaked, for example) of which she’d wanted to dispose. She imagined children running up these stairs, trying to make it to class, trying to make out. At that moment, it struck her as far more likely that the building had debuted as a hospital or an asylum. She rested her forehead on the rail, picked at the hard denim seam that ran the length of her jeans. There was a demon in her, she thought. Some flutter in her mind suggested itself, and what it whispered was: Don’t be foolish, Nadya, and take what you can get... On the other end of the line, the man was thinking that she sounded very young, and lovely, lovely in a way that emphasized how young she was. He hoped she’d live a long time. He looked out his window to the empty street, where nostalgic municipal authorities had preserved the cobblestones. A figure darted across them, stumbled, fell. The spotlights rounded the corner after it. HE: Look out your window. Look out your window and tell me what you see. The two found themselves watching similar scenes on different sections of the same street. The searchlights hawked revenge on sidewalks, swept shadows for loose change. The conversation slowed to an exchange of breath. Her building was on the corner; she could see two streets at once, where a different figure darted, disappeared, took cover in the hooded entrance of a former grocery store. The man enjoyed a mid-block perspective, from which he watched a broken shape struggle to stand on the stones without drawing further attention to itself. The woman rose on tiptoes to peer through the barred window in the stairs. Her view was empty again. On the other end of the line, the man cradled cold tea to his chest. A small spill stained his collar when the shot arrived. Not that she could have known it. SHE: They’ve put up propaganda over all the store signs, we protect you and the like. Do you have those? HE: I honestly don’t know. He watched the slow shine spread around the fallen figure, a halo for the head. NABOKOV: If a butterfly appears on the wall in Act One— CHEKHOV: —then its wings should ignite in Act Two. [Burst of sapphire from stage left.] [Beat.] NEIGHBOR 2: Shit role that guy got. NEIGHBOR 1 (cleaning binocular lenses with a cloth): I auditioned for the lead, do you think that maybe—? NEIGHBOR 3 (sinking behind tin trash can): I confess to a creeping sense of desperation. BECKETT (offstage): Leave me out of this. The following week they were back on the stairs, back on the phone. The insurgents had either seized or liberated nearby District 36, depending on your perspective, and to celebrate had let everyone out for a time. Or so her news sources said. The government districts, they figured, would now have to respond in kind. We’re like the kids of divorced parents who compete for affection, he said. It says here for a whole hour, she replied, maybe even more— HE: I’ll come see you. SHE: We’ll meet halfway. She heard the faint gong of his forehead falling against the glass. HE: What I wouldn’t do, you know, to get outside today. The woman confessed that some afternoons, in even the most anemic sun, she went up to the roof. She had a row of cacti up there, she explained, shriveled and frozen in little terra-cotta pots. Did he think they’d grow back? He didn’t answer for a long time. I’m not sure that’s safe, he said. Going up on the roof like that. I bet you could nearly see me, she said, if you went up on yours. Soft tan lines had set up camp on her shoulders, earned despite the chill. She suggested them, and he bronzed the image in. It’s fine, she argued. They weren’t so strict during daylight. He felt angry with her anyway for risking it, even as he admired the freckles beneath her eyes. He didn’t want to seem overly protective, overly concerned, so he changed the subject. The large desk where he sat was topped with glass, offering a faint reflection. Google Maps filled his screen edge to edge. By way of example, he told her how he’d been traveling lately. He tracked people around the world, read restaurant reviews, reviews of parks and libraries and government offices; of galleries, cafés, and museums. Recently, he’d been in the habit of reading hospital recommendations and trailing emergency patients across Russia. The reviews were translated automatically. Sometimes the same patient had visited multiple hospitals, seeking second opinions on chances of survival. He liked these recurring characters; they were his friends. He admired their will to live. He asked her if she was at her computer now and then remembered that, no, of course she wasn’t, she was in the stairwell, where he’d left her. But when you are, he said, try typing in K—. He named an oblast. HE: So, Google translates the reviews, so you just find a hospital, and then, well, here’s one: “Waited four hours, no bribes.” That’s not so bad, actually, compared to what I’ve seen in rural areas. But there’s this one woman, let me find her. Here. She has some problem with her stomach. She’s been to at least six hospitals in the area. And by area, I mean a huge fucking swath of Siberia. SHE: What do you think it is? HE: Maybe she’s a hypochondriac. The woman peered through the bars at the propaganda that had rebilled the old stores across the street. SHE: Maybe she’s dying and doesn’t want to believe it. HE: “Very nice hospital. Train staff with dialogue to show listening to patients. You constantly have to wait even for payment through the cashier, the cashier was waited for two hours.” SHE (laughing): It’s a relief to me, you know, that the algorithms are still shit. HE: “In the ambulance, you can turn the clock around.” She navigated to her own maps as her battery sounded its tinny alarm. She chose a town at random, not the one he had suggested, swiped away the notification that the device would soon be dead. There: a frozen place, high definition. How beautiful it was. Trees bent deeply over the road, knighted by snow. A tent in the woods was choked up by a stovepipe and its stream of smoke. Ice sculptures were dyed bright colors in the way her mother had shown her when the woman was just a girl and went out to shape fresh snowfall into igloos. Her mother mixed the dye in spray bottles once filled with cleaning supplies, which the girl, now the woman, used to inflict garish patterns on the yard. The sculptures on the screen were arranged beneath a string of flags made ragged by the wind. To think places like this still existed. SHE: Do you think it’s better, over there? NABOKOV: Ha! NEIGHBOR 1 (raising and then lowering binoculars): Depends on your perspective. She carried the phone down the stairs, through the pressurized door, down the hall, cupping the speaker to her chest. Went to open her door, found it was already unlocked. Again. That’s not smart, said the man. Please, take care of yourself. I know, I know, she said. One sec. Inside, she connected jack to cord. Slipped off her shoes by the bed. Why do you sound like you’re inside a Trojan Horse? he asked. Just my apartment, you’re on speaker, she replied. She turned on the lamp. One sec again, the people across from me like to stare. Get curtains, he said. I have a curtain, she replied, sliding a piece of newspaper, slipped onto the rod by loops of string, across the pane. Do you want some tea? Sure, he said. I fucked mine up. Okay, I’ll get it. You play some music, she said. He was still at his desk, by the window, in front of the maps. Outside, a clean-up crew bustled. Michelin men in white body suits pointed fine hoses at the cobblestones, where last week’s stains remained. They glowed blue with the night, confirming the presence of the moon. He thought about splicing in this frame, narrating the shot to her as if it were occurring at this moment, right now, because it felt wrong to have witnessed it alone, to be forever distracting her with things like hospital reviews in K— oblast. His laptop was an oyster open to the world. Escape was always almost possible. The brash light of the screen brought out the gray in his face. He looked like shit! The tabs were open to ice storms, mountains decadent with snow, a hospital lobby, movie clips, a streaming app on which he borrowed music, incognito. He loaded the clip of the cellist and pressed play, held the phone close to his ear to catch the sound of the woman moving through her little room. He imagined those sheer, breathy curtains, floor-length, that young women liked, as if they all aspired to live inside a lung. Or maybe she’d simply tacked up a sheet. He couldn’t remember how long she’d lived here. The addresses forsook him, had washed away in the current of recent silence. He couldn’t remember if this was the room he’d visited a few years ago, where her life had seemed so upsettingly haphazard; perched on a wooden chair taken from the stairwell, for free, he’d felt that he had something to do with the observable impermanence. She used to faint sometimes during sex, he recalled, most often in the shower. Crouched there on the bathroom tiles, holding her as she came to, he’d considered the weight of the soul. He felt a pang now, felt the pull of the white suits outside. Her voice drew him sharply from his reverie. SHE: This is depressing. HE: I thought that was my charm. [Muzak or satellite radio jazz audible from offstage.] SHE: No, the music. It’s depressing. Play something else. [Beat.] HE: They’re cleaning up over here. Or they were cleaning up. SHE: Oh. HE: They’re gone now. It’s fine. Please be more careful. SHE: Okay. HE: It’s real. [Beat.] SHE: They’re brave. You have to give them that. I wish I believed in something half as much. HE: Yes, there’s that. [Man leans against imaginary window again, peers down.] HE: All the same, I’m glad you don’t. The neighbors across from the woman’s apartment were intrigued to see her light was on again. Sympathizer, they guessed. She fit the insurgent type. Young. Idealistic. Putting up quotes all over the walls. Not nearly afraid enough. And one of the only other human beings in range, really, to develop theories about. They watched her shadow flicker through the paper shade drawn across the pane. (She was onto them; they were onto each other; the whole air shaft fluttered with headlines meant to keep out Peeping Toms and Janes.) The paper fit imperfectly over the window, and when she crossed the room, it was possible to catch glimpses through the gaps. She wore a red sweatshirt and blue jeans. Her hair was down, kinked from a braid. The couple with the red night-lights watched her draw it up into a knot. Phone balanced between cheek and shoulder, she pulled the newspaper aside an inch herself and peered out. One floor below, a man was looking back. One of his hands was pocketed. The other held a beer. She raised her eyes a floor above to see what was happening up there. The neighbors had never been the type to draw much attention to themselves. That’s why she’d stayed. She waited tables at the trattoria around the corner—or had, before everything shut down—and then came home to fix her plays. They were all of them in this building quiet by nature and hourly waged. No one meant to pry. At the moment there was simply nothing else to do. Sometimes a bird dove through the brick channel between the windows, and they envied it. They craned their necks, considered that someone had had the job of designing the tower on which those searchlights stood. The beer fizzed. The red light bled its liquid glow and rinsed the thought away. They thought of the sea, the way the sea-foam mouthed off onto the shore. They cupped an ear to catch the sound of waves. One missed the beach. Another missed the women. NEIGHBOR 1: What I wouldn’t do for a proper schnitzel— NEIGHBOR 2: —or a long drive— NEIGHBOR 3: —or an unskunked beer— NABOKOV: The devil is in the details, and all great stories are fairy tales. NEIGHBOR 3: I’ll show you where the fucking fairies are— NABOKOV: The gardener used naphthalene, my mother the ether, and I myself later used many killing agents. I looked forward to the crunch of a pin going through the chitinous thorax— NEIGHBOR 2 (rolling eyes, then lifting binoculars to them): Right, so that was the difference between them. The woman carried her teacup to the bathtub, ran a bath. The man sat at his desk with his cold chamomile, imagining hers fresh. They listened to the water run. The woman on the phone, whom he maybe still missed, was meanwhile theorizing about him. It’s involuntary, she was saying. She was perched on the edge of her own tub, nursing her mug and the phone. Nursing old wounds: It’s almost as if you think too fast, she said, like you scheme without helping it. Gee, thanks. I only mean, it’s like your schemes come to you all at once, fully formed, so it’s not like they’re premeditated. I’ll take that as a compliment, he said. I’m just saying, she added, I don’t think it’s intentionally manipulative. Has it ever occurred to you that you’re pretty manipulative yourself? I never said I wasn’t. But you implied by comparison. I don’t think it’s always preferable, she said, to think things all the way through to the consequences. Like not calling for a year? SHE: Funny, in my book, it’s you who didn’t call me. The woman drew her lower lip between her teeth. The newspaper that hung over the window fluttered. It was the flight of juvenility, she thought, fluttering through the door. She sank a hand into the bath to test the temperature. It came out scalded, red to the wrist. It’s been a shitty year, she said. She taught him foreign idioms. She explained how to beat egg whites in French, monter des blancs en neige, and with what tool in German, i.e., a Schneebesen. In every other language, she noted, to beat egg whites means to make snow, whereas—We’re using the short end of the stick, he joked. The insurgents had gained further territory and were letting all their subjects out. Permanently. For good. They were closing in; they were winning; they would be here soon. The man and the woman could not resist the contagion of the festive mood. She laughed. She was ready, she said. Even overprepared. When not on the phone, she often sat in the tub for hours, listening to language courses. Her legs were covered in razor nicks incurred while conjugating irregular verbs and gendering the nouns, der, die, das. She spoke a little of everything by now. That was company, she thought. A bit of static interference and civil-sounding chatter she couldn’t understand. She rotated through, disc-jockeyed German, Hindi, Russian, French. She was fit to renounce her language for the native tongue of the invaders, the liberators, ha ha, whoever it was that came next. She knew how to thank them, how to curse them, how to plead: no rape. HE: Do you still have that dress? The man on the phone had an excellent tub, one of those claw-foot basins that swallows you whole. She’d long had the goal of bathing in it. In those intervals when he was not already engaged, or married, or monogamous, they’d gone instead to the public baths. The memory made her smile, though it also dredged up pain. In the swell of steam, the full force of him had been delegated to the blurry shapes of other people. She remembered she’d worn a leotard, self-conscious about her figure, but you could hardly see anyone in there, she could have worn nothing at all. The Lycra clung to her belly like a blister. What a relief afterward to step out into the cold. And how superior the sex, later that night, in bed. Her body felt purged and compact, a polished seed. The orgasm bloomed and bloomed and met its limits, then shriveled into memory. That was the way of the saunas in the public baths. You waited, you suffered, and when the suffering lifted— SHE: I used to think you should have given me your place when you were away. You have all that space! Me, I open the oven and sit down on the bed. HE: It’s yours. Come on over. SHE: Thank you. HE: Only I’m sick of it, I’d rather take you somewhere else. SHE: Where then? HE: I’d think that was obvious. She tapped a foot to the surface of the water. Still scalding. The bathroom swirled with steam. She breathed in deep and choked. A drip of sweat ran down her chin. She cracked open the door. Closed it again. Then, like an afterthought, she swung it wide. There was nothing better than a hot bath in winter chill! But she had just the one window, where her neighbors kept watch. That was her request, she said, wherever they went: a magnificent tub and a cool cross-breeze. She would have liked to open everything, lift the windows and unlock the doors. It was a game of chicken, she thought. That was life. Who would draw the curtains first? She was tired of waiting, tired of accommodating. Of simply delaying capitulation, and the sordid pleasure that came with it. The suspense, she supposed, was in the when, the how much, you inevitably gave. She stood from the bath and crossed the room. The towel slipped. Delirious, ecstatic, she wedged the phone between cheek and shoulder, wedged her hands under the lip of the window, struggling to raise the pane. She told him to hold on, one sec, I just—She braced a foot against the sill, pushed with all the strength of her legs. Then, quite suddenly, the window gave and welcomed in the cold. The release drew her up to her full height, into the top pane, so that for a moment she stood like a stained-glass saint stuck in the window of a church. Then the bullet quietly opened up her chest. The last thought arrived. She was reminded that, at geological depths, the earth erupts with something like wrath. He stared for a moment at the phone in his hand, perplexed. One sec, she’d said. I just—Then came a muffled crash. He checked the screen again to make sure she hadn’t hung up. Crossing the apartment to the bath, he flipped on the light switch. Hello? he said. There was the tub, gleaming beneath the showerhead. The framed nylons ad, in which a model rolled the shadow of a stocking up her shin. He imagined the woman instead. She was seated on the rim with her tea, admiring her unstockinged legs. She wore nothing but a towel, and her thighs extended from the hem. An average-size woman, she’d become extremely heavy when she fainted, he recalled. He’d draw her across his knees and press a cold washcloth to her wrists... He was good at waiting. He looked at the phone. Leaving the light on, he returned to his desk. He stared into the laptop screen at the brutalized hospitals and tundra exposed to permafrost, now not so permanent. They were all awaiting miracles, these isolated towns. They willed a change in the tilt of the earth, the melting of the straits. Soon enough, the ships would sail through, like blood back into a resuscitated heart. And so they clung. His own reflection flashed in the window. He’d gained weight, lost hair, this past year. She’d be disappointed to see him when she did. The phone was still pressed to his ear. He used to fantasize about her, about fucking her in public restrooms, at parties, in other people’s kitchens; it would be such a relief to be caught, to confess. A great sadness collected in the barrel of his chest. He swiveled in his chair and looked back into the soft white glow of the empty bath. The gleam of the tiles faintly pulsed. He recalled the way she flinched, and violently, if he so much as touched a fingertip to the vertebrae of her neck. What he’d like to do is take her to the Russian baths, had they done that yet? He’d like to take her halfway around the world, up north, away from everyone they knew, their prying gaze—away from how he saw himself—buy a plot of land and wait for the earth to thaw. A shadow shifts, something flickers in the bath. He listens, waiting for her to catch her breath, finish her sentence, call him back. Obviously they’ll learn, they’ll speak whatever she likes, he’ll tell her everything she’s ever wanted to know in as many languages as he can manage, Schnee and neige, and when the time comes, should it ever come to that, he’ll talk her softly into death.

        "story": "You’re seldom suspicious when you’re happy, and so I didn’t realize that the whole awful business was about to start when Vita said, “It’s been ages since you had lunch with Frank. Why don’t you two grab a bite?” Whenever Frank was asked a question he didn’t want to answer he’d say, “Look in the mirror and ask yourself that.” I was tempted that day, but instead I smiled at my lovely wife while I contemplated my hateful brother. As the kind of lawyer he was, Frank had a whopper license, and it helped, because he told awfully long, rather dubious stories. It was sometimes the same story, or nearly so. Now and then it was one I had told him that he later told back to me, inserting himself, with embellishments, not remembering it was mine. Talkers who repeat themselves pay no attention to their listeners—they’re at an imaginary podium, waving their arms, broadcasting to a crowd—and are usually themselves bad listeners, if not completely deaf. Many people found Frank’s stories amusing; others called him a bore and said, “How do you stand him?” Yet I was often fascinated by Frank’s stories. You don’t have to like someone to listen. When I was in the mood, I heard him repeat them, noting how he changed them in the telling, what he left in, what he omitted, the exaggerations, the irrelevancies, the new details. The nun who caught him smoking: in one version, she told him to confess it as a mortal sin and lingered outside the confession box to hear him bare his soul to the priest. In another, she forced him to kneel on a broomstick a whole day as punishment. In the one I liked best, the nun handed him his half-pack of unsmoked cigarettes and made him eat them. But I knew that because of wheezy lungs Frank had never smoked. The one about his being brutally murdered in Florida by a drug gang: his bullet-riddled body discovered in a Miami mansion, his face mangled beyond recognition. Our parents got the call, on a weekend when Frank was on vacation, and they were devastated. Turned out, the man had Frank’s stolen passport on him. A great story, but untrue. Another: his saving the life of my high school friend Melvin Yurick, whom he’d found bleeding at a campsite in the local woods, Yurick having gashed his hand with a hunting knife. In Frank’s telling, by rescuing Yurick he’d altered the course of history, because Yurick later became a billionaire pioneer in digital media. The story was mine—it was I, hiking with Yurick, who’d stanched his blood and helped him home. The part about Yurick becoming a billionaire was true though. I listened to know Frank better, because even as a child I found him tricky, cruel, dangerous, and unreliable, as well as (people can sometimes be their opposites) direct, kindly, reassuring, and helpful. There was so much of Frank, and he was so contradictory, the whole of him so overwhelming, I had to deal with him in pieces. Although he made a convincing enough pretense of being my friend, I knew he didn’t like me. He was a local hero, Frank Belanger Esq., Injury Law, a successful attorney in our town of Littleford. Because of our name (school kids are such mockers of names), we Belanger brothers were known as the Bad Angel brothers. Frank was a tough opponent but a good ally, very wealthy from the accumulation of contingency fees. Whiplash windfalls, he called them. He made no secret of his ambition, crowing to me when we were kids, I want to be so rich I can shit money! He defended wounded people who were usually poor, so justice was money, punishment was money, reward was money, morality was money, love was money. His admiring clients quoted his well-known remark, I bite people on the neck for a living, with approval. He’d plagiarized that, and other wisecracks, from a ruthless lawyer he’d worked for, named Hoyt. I was no match for Frank’s sarcasm, his competitive nature, or his killer instinct. I had left home to escape his shadow. My work as a geologist kept me away, at first in the West, then in the wider world, a spell in Africa, later—my cobalt years—in the Northwest. Earlier, when I married Vita, I bought a house in town and returned more and more frequently as my mother aged and was cheered by visits. Vita, who’d grown up in the unregulated sprawl and improvisation of South Florida, found the solidity and order of New England a reassurance. And this was also a chance for our son, Gabe, to attend my old high school and be a Littleford Lion. Usually, when he heard I was in town, Frank insisted on meeting for lunch, always at the Littleford Diner. If I was free I tended to agree, because seeing him, hearing his stories, I was able to gauge the temperature of our relationship. Family members have a special untranslatable language of subtle gestures, finger play, winks and nods, little insults, odd allusions and needling words, that are devastating within the family yet meaningless to outsiders. But when Vita urged me to have lunch with him, I smiled—and equivocated. And a few days later I said flatly no, because of the way Frank himself asked in an email, framing it as a demand, putting Lunch in the subject line, with the date and time, and the message, Be there. I had left home to avoid orders like this. Mineral prospecting and exploration could be frustrating and expensive—I had started out with an old van and a dirt bike, testing samples of gravel from dry riverbeds in the Arizona desert for surface gold. I liked the freedom, and now and then I hit pay dirt. Early on, I was a one-man company, so I could do as I wished, and later, with money, I acquired technology and dug deeper. In the years when I traveled internationally, I specialized in industrial diamonds in Australia and emeralds in Colombia and Zambia. My contracts were sometimes with major conglomerates, which helped develop the claims, but even at my busiest I was never subjected to any rigorous oversight. My success rate spoke for itself. I was trusted by the companies that hired me, and if I happened to be given orders, they were tactfully phrased. No one in the extractive industry ever loomed over me and said, Be there. As a child I was given commands by my father, and when he died, Mother was the order giver. Now that she was fading, it seemed that Frank was becoming the dominant one in the family. I disliked his insistence, his barking an order, so I did not reply to his invitation. I was at my desk in my study when Vita pushed open the door and said, “Got a minute?” This is always a daunting question for me, but it was especially worrying that day. Vita and I had been going through a marital transition. It had begun when I formed a mining company to conduct an extensive search in Idaho for a source of cobalt—ethical cobalt as opposed to the free-for-all in the Congo, where small children sat in the mud in remote Kolwezi, clawing at ore-bearing sludge. The Idaho search area was vast, the high-tech equipment others had trained on it had been expensive. This is not the place to describe nuclear magnetic resonance imaging or satellite technology in prospecting, but these had been used, without finding the coppery deposits that indicate a source of cobalt. My success also signaled a crisis in my marriage. In recent years, with each of my prospecting trips—trips I had taken all my married life—Vita had drawn away. Before the cobalt strike, I’d been in the Zambian Copperbelt, pioneering the mining of high-quality emeralds. I was gone for months at a time and on each home leave felt a growing distance between Vita and me; with her objecting more and more to my absences, I knew I’d have to work to regain her trust. What made this hard was that, although I always returned, I made the mistake of the committed—the single-minded, the selfish—traveler, who regards travel as a mission. I stopped coming all the way back. I was distracted by a new venture. Having seen the exploitation of children mining cobalt in the Congo—a subject that Vita herself was outraged by, as a board member of the agency Rescue/Relief—I became involved in the mining of ethical cobalt in Idaho. Then something unexpected: Vita did not scold me for being away. She said she happened to be preoccupied, she clucked and went about her business; and if you were outside this marriage looking in you’d feel all was more or less well, because so little was said, two busy people, life returning to normal, no raised voices, the marriage ticking away. But that ticking, which was in fact a silence, something like acceptance, was ominous. It seemed to indicate that we were too far apart to talk—not a peaceful silence but a shadow of distrust, and now I felt our marriage was hollow and unrepairable. I didn’t have another woman. I had work and prospects. My business was booming—I was content. But I was alone. No anger, no yelling. It was not hatred, because hatred is passion, and passion means caring. It was worse than hatred. She was indifferent and loveless. She simply didn’t care. I had returned home to find a changed Vita. She reminded me that she had asked me not to take the Idaho contract, that she was (as she put it) “perimenopausal,” and hadn’t I been away long enough? I told her that although I constantly referred to what I did as “my work,” I did not regard it as work. I loved being active, I enjoyed the challenges of being outdoors—of bad roads and tent camps—hauling technical equipment into the wilderness to locate a mother lode. It was treasure hunting, involving risk and expense. And my months of diligent prospecting in Idaho had paid off. Vita was not impressed. I said, “It wasn’t easy—I missed you.” “I told myself you were dead. I got on with my life.” “The strike was huge,” I said. I never uttered the word cobalt or said that it was in high demand as the essential metal in every serious battery on earth. I never mentioned how much money I was making. I explained that my contract included a sharing clause, which meant that I had to make a personal investment on the front end, but I would profit on the back end if we were successful. And so it happened. It was still early but the cash flow was considerable, which was the reason I could go home more frequently. But I had stayed away too long. I came home to a different house, to a wife I scarcely recognized, and—sadly—one who scarcely recognized me. I could see the upset in Gabe, obviously torn. Vita had worked on him. He was different, too—sad, confused, watchful. When I tried to hug him, he squirmed out of my grasp. The worst of it was that he had been accepted to law school, and I could not share his joy. My great strike in Idaho, Vita now a wealthy wife, and successful in her own career, Gabe on the dean’s list—three great developments. We had every reason to be happy. That was the situation when Vita pushed the door open and said, “Got a minute?” I happened to be busy mapping a further Idaho claim, but I put it aside because of the delicate time and said, “Sure. Have a seat.” “I’ll stand.” She folded her arms. “What’s on your mind?” “Did you get a message from Frank?” I smiled hearing her speak his name, because whenever I heard it I was on my guard. “Yes, a week ago, after you suggested it, he emailed me about lunch.” “You didn’t reply.” “I’m—ah—crafting a response,” I said. It was a typical Frank expression, like his others: In this fashion and At this juncture and I’m thinking it over mentally. Then I said, “How do you know I didn’t reply?” “He’s waiting.” “Okay—I’ll tell him I’m not going. I’ve heard enough from him.” “You really ought to go, Cal.” I remembered his message: Be there. And Vita was repeating this command, punctuating it with my name. As a geologist in seismic locations, I knew that shaky ground was something actual, and undesirable, and often dangerous. I’d just had another great commercial success, but I’d returned to uncertainty in marital terms. And with Vita standing there, and my fearing a long discussion that would become a harangue possibly ending in tears, I knew what I must do. I wanted to stay happy. The lunch he’d proposed was in the week of my birthday and, as I’ve mentioned, the period of one of my greatest successes as a prospector—ethical cobalt. Frank was a man of insinuations, of subtle gestures and sly asides, and long ambiguous stories rather than explicit statements. But, as always during these lunches, it helped to know where I stood, and he had what Vita often called “lunchtime charm.” “Fidge,” he said, rising from the booth to greet me. I was at the diner on time, but obviously he had gotten there early—his coat was arranged on a hanger rather than slung on a hook. Fidge was my childhood nickname. I’d been a restless, fidgeting youth. Apart from Frank and our widowed mother, no one else in the world used this name for me. It was like an obscure password. I was not Pascal, or Cal, to either of them: I was Fidge, with all that name implied. “Hi, Frank, how you doing?” I sat across from him in the booth by the wall and took a menu out of the rack near the ketchup bottle and other condiments. He sat in a prayerful posture, with his hands folded and his head lowered. Did he remember my birthday? Did he know of my success in Idaho? And what stories was he going to tell? He lifted his head to stare at me with his odd lopsided face. It was divided into two vertical planes: the right part—cheek, jaw, portion of forehead enlarged by baldness, and cold eyes, swagged downward in a frown—and the left part uplifted in a smile, the contradictory face you see on some Greek masks. When the facial droop on his right side was saying no, his left side—eye and crinkled forehead—was insisting yes. I imagined this complex face, with its built-in stare to register righteous surprise, to be very intimidating to a witness and very persuasive to a jury. His angular expression operated independently, so he actually had two faces, one opposing the other. As for the set of his jaw, his bared teeth were also at odds, as though he were biting open a pistachio. He seldom smiled, but when he did his mouth had, ironically, the goofy gape of a pistachio nut. Poor guy, you think, but no. His was not an affliction, it was a boast that set him apart as someone special. What had begun in his teenage years, after a spell of mumps, as a mild form of Bell’s palsy, Frank had discovered to be an asset, and he somehow contrived to remain uncured, his face fixed and asymmetrical, and looking—he once told me with pride—like a pirate. Something else: I always felt that he was scowling at me furiously behind this face. “There’s a short answer and a long answer to that,” he said of my harmless greeting. “The short answer is I’ve got a ton of things on my mind.” His eyes dismissed this as he agitated his folded hands. He said, “The long answer is what I have on my mind, the details. I keep thinking, when Dad was my age he had a small insurance agency, and was in debt because of some bad faith policies, and two young kids. I don’t know how he kept his composure...” I started to say, Dad was an optimist, and was going to add how he was positive and spiritual, his piety giving him strength, but Frank had unfolded his hands to gesticulate and was still talking. “... something to do with not facing facts, being a kind of dreamer. Ask him what he did for a living and he’d say, ‘Insurance, but what I’ve always wanted to do was some sort of forestry-related work.’ He wanted to be a forest ranger! I could never live like that. What I never understood...” Dad never wanted to be a forest ranger. But instead of correcting Frank, I said, “He admired you for having important friends.” This seemed not to register. Frank said, “Think of it. How he died before the reckoning came. It was Mum who had to face the music. She had her feet on the ground.” “And her parents’ money.” Frank wagged his finger, using it to clear my statement away. He said, “She paid back every penny.” This was an old story I’d heard before. In an early version the debts were forgiven and Dad was absolved, but Frank had advised Mum on the procedure. Today, Mum was the heroine, having settled Dad’s bad faith debt. Something was unspoken, too. I had always been Dad’s favorite, and Frank’s disparaging him as a deadbeat seemed a dig at me—another of those roundabout, untranslatable family slurs I referred to earlier. “Can I get you gentlemen a drink?” It was the waitress, an older woman with a weary smile and a pad in her hand. “Tomato juice, please,” I said. “No ice.” Clasping his hands again, Frank said, “Water.” “Still or sparking?” “Tap water.” “Shall I tell you today’s specials?” “Pass,” Frank said in a snippy voice. Seeing the woman wince, I said, “I know what I’m going to have. A cup of clam chowder and the grilled haddock.” “Good choice. Mashed potato or salad?” “Mashed potato.” “And you, sir?” Frank said, “Same here.” The waitress repeated the order, reading from her pad. She then said, “I’ll be right back with your drinks.” Frank leaned toward me. “Imagine, Dad an insurance stiff grandly calling himself an importer.” “It was his hobby. Some of the stuff he sold was made overseas. China, for sure. Like a lot of my drilling equipment.” Leaning closer, as though to someone on a witness stand, Frank said, “Think how hard it is to be who you say you are.” Leaving me with this enigmatic thought, he sat back, looking pleased with himself. The waitress set down my tomato juice and Frank’s water and said, “Food’s on the way.” Frank tapped the side of the glass with one finger, as though to test its temperature. “What was I saying?” “Mum paid back every penny.” I did not correct him. I was enjoying this skewed version of the story. And there was more. The valiant widow repaying her late husband’s debt with her own money. And Frank taking time off from his law practice to help her. As he talked I noted the variations in the story—Dad now portrayed as selfish and neglectful, concealing his profits, squirreling money away, defaulting on his debts, undermining the family. At a certain point in the conversation, my interest waned. I found this painful to hear, as though by listening to it I was being disloyal to Dad. I said, “What about the things Dad did that had nothing to do with money? His sacrifices. His great heart. How he never complained. He loved Mum. He adored her. That counts for a lot.” Frank stared at me as I spoke, expressionless, his slanted lips narrowed, unimpressed, or else not listening. He was a relaxed and expansive talker, but he was an impatient and agitated listener, and his blank stare demonstrated his impatience. He said, “Every time I pick up a screwdriver I think of how Dad used the tip of a knife as a screwdriver so all the knives in our cutlery drawer had a sort of twist at the tip, a weird little kink, where it was used to remove a screw.” “I do that sometimes.” Frank knew this, he’d often mocked me for it. Some of those damaged knives might have been my doing. “And not only the knives,” Frank said. “What about the time he lunched the car door?” He was belittling Dad, yet I smiled at a Littleford word I loved—like bollocky for naked, tonic for soda, hosey for choose, and What a pisser.Lunched meant ruined, but I hated hearing it applied to something Dad had done. “Banged the door against a parking meter in a hurry to see a client.” “Just a ding,” I said. “Then, trying to smooth it out he pushed too hard on his electric buffer and fried the coil—lunched that, too.” “Two lunches, what’s the big deal.” “One lunch too many,” Frank said. “Clam chowder,” the waitress said, sliding the cups toward us. “Haddock’s coming up.” “Consider being a woman that age,” Frank said, as the waitress hurried away. He was nodding knowingly. “Probably fiftysomething and still hustling for tips. You know what waitresses make? Probably around a buck and change an hour.” He said this sourly, so I said, “She’s about my age—and younger than you.” Frank rapped on the table and said in an insistent hiss, “Cash is king.” I was looking at his lips, how they trembled with these words, and expected him to say more. But there was no more. I dumped my oyster crackers into my chowder and began eating. Watching me with damp lips, Frank stirred his chowder, dabbing at it with his spoon, but instead of eating any, he went on fiddling with it, like a chemist with a potion. His not eating disconcerted me and made it hard for me to swallow until, self-conscious, I gave up and pushed my half-eaten cup aside. Frank was still poking at his untasted chowder. He said, “Took Dad and Mum to the governor’s ball. Mum just sat, dazzled. Dad goes up to Senator McBride and says, ‘I remember your father.’” “Dad was very congenial. The only people he couldn’t stand were lazy, aimless types. Remember his expression?” Frank was staring at his chowder. “He’s like a fart in a mitten—nice.” But Frank said, “McBride’s father was convicted of bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. He served six years in a federal lockup.” The waitress returned with two plates. “Still working on that?” she said to Frank, who’d left his spoon in his untasted chowder. “Take it,” he said and nudged it with his knuckles. The waitress set down the plates of haddock, and clearing away the chowder cups said, “Let me know if you need anything else.” “Thanks,” I said and started to eat, but seeing Frank poke at his fish as though he were trying to find out if it was edible, I was thrown and found it hard to swallow. “How’s your son?” I asked. Frank said, “Look in the mirror and ask yourself that question.” He lifted and dropped the food on his plate, seeming to seek something underneath it. He did this studiously, with a faint scowl of disgust on his lips. I wondered whether he’d ask me about Gabe. I was proud of Gabe’s academic record but decided not to volunteer anything unless Frank asked. Frank’s head was down. He was making a little hut of his heap of mashed potatoes, squaring the sides, hollowing out the middle, roofing it with flakes of his broken fish. I watched him resisting his food, and his stubbornness made me recall his slights and abuses when we were younger. In my angered imagination I pictured myself dragging him out of the booth and violently force-feeding him. It was the way an imprisoned hunger striker was fed, first immobilized, strapped to a restraint chair, a nasogastric tube pushed into his nose and snaked into his throat, and nutritious slop hosed into him, while he gagged and struggled to breathe. Force-feeding had been used many times on prisoners, and it was deemed torture—cruel, inhumane, degrading, and sometimes fatal—but torture as a fine art, making it especially pleasant for me to contemplate Frank (who once mentioned to me that he approved of it) intubated and choking to death, unable to speak or to tell me another bullshit story. “McBride later joined the D.C. branch of my old firm.” I needed to remind myself that this was the father of the senator Dad had apparently insulted. “Became a lobbyist.” Frank launched into a vaguely familiar story about lobbying, setting up businesses on tribal land in Idaho, leasing agreements and financial schemes, saying, “Some of that land is fractionated,” and repeating the phrase, “Cash is king.” But as he was still poking at his food—sculpting it, so to speak—and not eating, I could not understand his story. I knew I had heard it before, something about casinos, but this time it had a different emphasis that caught my attention and seemed personal. “Mineral rights,” he kept repeating, and I wondered whether he was referring in some enigmatic way to the cobalt deposit I’d discovered in that same area of the state. Yet as long as he pushed his food around his plate, and did not eat any of it, I was too distracted with my fantasy—force-feeding him to death—to follow his story. To get him to stop, I said, “Do you want anything else?” “Yes,” he said. “I want to find the rich jerk who took a dump on me—kept me waiting in an outer office for almost an hour, seeming to take some pleasure in it, and then snubbed me when he deigned to see me. ‘We’ll get back to you. Have a nice day.’” “When was this?” “When I was nineteen, the summer I did office work for that Boston law firm.” He pushed his plate aside. “I’d like to punch him in the face.” In an early, much longer version of this story, the rich jerk was a young woman, and Frank had an exquisite rejoinder to Have a nice day. He said, I have other plans. In another version, it was an older woman and he demanded to see her boss. Getting even was a mission with Frank; but you never really get even—you just do more damage. “Anyway, I heard his wife ditched him.” Frank folded his arms, presiding over his strange mounded plate of uneaten food. “Turned out he wasn’t doing his homework. But here’s the kicker. He claimed he stumbled on some stairs and bumped his wang on the newel. So what does he do? He sues the building’s owners for loss of consortium. Because of the injuries he sustained in his stumble, his wife has been deprived of her”—Frank lifted his hands and clawed air quotes near my face—“husband’s services.” He twisted his swagged face into a smile. “Her comfort and happiness in his so-called society have been impaired by his damaged wang. Hey, I hated the guy, but I learned something.” I wanted to ponder “loss of consortium,” but I had indigestion. I was disgusted by my half-eaten meal, and I was disturbed at the sight of Frank’s uneaten one, which, scraped and combined, was lumped like garbage. “Fidge,” Frank said suddenly, shoving his cuff. “Look at the time—gotta go.” He slid out of the booth, lifted his coat from the hanger, and left in a hurry. He had not eaten anything. He had not asked me a personal question. He had deflected my own. To a passerby—such as the waitress who was approaching the booth—his stories were rantings, if not borderline insane. But I knew they contained a meaning. “Someone wasn’t hungry,” the waitress said. I thanked her, gave her a bigger tip than she was expecting, and spent the rest of the day reflecting on the lunch—what Frank said, what he didn’t say, his having eaten nothing, and I grew melancholy. As a prospector, in the business of searching wild places for minerals and metals, I’d dealt with some rough individuals. They were ornery or contrary, but I could handle them; they were difficult, but like me they were looking for profit and were willing to work hard for it. Prospecting for any ore is a physical challenge and only the toughest are equal to it. These men and women didn’t intend me any harm; it was territorial—they wanted to be the first to stake a claim. Frank was different: his was a mental game, no risk involved, and it was personal. He wanted to torture me, he enjoyed seeing me suffer, he aimed to ruin me. I had no idea why. Over the years, I was frequently far away from Littleford and Frank, but even at a great distance he could be obnoxious. He had a gift, common to tyrants, of insinuating himself into my consciousness and humming there like a fever. When I was anywhere near him, he was unbearable. I banished vengeful thoughts from my mind and was unfailingly courteous to him, the way you might behave with exaggerated politeness to someone you dislike, because you don’t want your contempt to show. We’d been born three years apart, to older, grateful, and therefore indulgent parents. I came second and was the happier for it, because so much less was expected of me. As the firstborn, Frank was adored—he was a pleaser and a prodigy, Mother’s favorite. Father consoled himself with me, as both of us were lowly and solitary. Like Dad, I was restless, good with my hands, but slow to speak. I didn’t mind the attention that Frank got from Mother; to be overlooked freed me from the responsibilities and high expectations that burdened Frank, who was (Mother said) destined for great things. In an early family portrait, taken in a Littleford studio, we fitted together as a plausible and matching quartet, parents and children. Mother was small and delicate and smiling; Father, stern, his features echoed in those of the two boys, his beaky face with his interrogating nose, his querying, close-set eyes, thin, skeptical lips, sharp chin, dense, dark hair, thick at the sides, modifying his large, sagging ears. Quebecois features, he would have said, but powerful. In a red flannel shirt he’d have looked like a lumberjack; in his expensive suit he could have passed for an aristocrat: a bit foreign, aloof, with an air of concealing something—his origins perhaps. It was this, though he seldom mentioned it: his mother was Native American—and our mother had an Abenaki in her ancestry. So we Belangers were special in Littleford, where everyone but us had an immigrant story. We had no tale of an Atlantic crossing, no Ellis Island stopover, only the simple fact that in hard times the families (Mother was a Bouchard) dropped into New England from the north, after being in Quebec forever, or before recorded time, at least recorded in family memory. That’s who I was and where I came from; but the early family photographs of Frank and me are misleading. Family features are not fixed. You start out looking somewhat alike and then you change; in time, experience and circumstances and moods begin to work on those features. In high school, even with his palsied face, Frank and I resembled each other enough to be recognized as brothers, but after I left home for college, becoming myself—my face reflecting the person within me, my features softened, my eyebrows growing owlish, my lips readier to smile, my eyes more welcoming to new scenes; and I’d become muscular, while Frank had grown fatter, his face more asymmetrical and complacent, a malicious mask for his ruthless ambition. By my late twenties no one would have taken me to be Frank’s brother, and that suited me. We made our difference emphatic in the two ways we pronounced our name. I kept to Dad’s slushy Quebecois way of saying it, “Bel—onzhay,” while Frank’s clanged, “Bel—anger.” But never mind—in Littleford we were always the Bad Angels. The focus was mainly on Frank, who’d stayed in town. He said he had a righteous reason. The summer after Frank graduated from high school, Dad died of a heart attack in his office, Belanger Insurance, in Littleford Square. He was forty-nine years old. It came without warning. He smoked a pipe, he was a moderate drinker, and he seemed to be in good health. This was an ominous sign to Frank and me: a warning that we too might be struck down at an early age, and I’m sure it was a factor in both of us living with a particular urgency, the shadow of Dad’s death hanging over us. Being an insurance man, convinced of the necessity of being heavily insured, and shrewd in devising the most beneficial policy, his death made Mother wealthy in a manner that she found daunting. What to do with all this money? That was when Frank announced that he would not leave Littleford. After he graduated from law school, he would remain in town to protect Mother. “I’m staying. I’m looking after Ma. With all this money, she’s got a target on her back.” Mother was relieved, because Frank was exceptional. But this notion of his high intelligence was a burden. The assumption of his having to work wonders was so powerful that it made Frank a cheat at an early age, and this cheating altered his features, first his eyes—a flintiness, then the exaggerated droop in his face. He knew his lopsided gaze was intimidating. Needing to win, to be best, made him into a bully; having to score high marks meant he often had to bluff his way, fudge his answers, and that pressure turned him into an arguer and an explainer and a blamer, a public school pusher, later a neck-biting lawyer. This makes him sound repellent, and if this were the whole of him you’d write him off as a monster and avoid him. Yet there was more, not another side of him but a subtler aspect of that same treacherous side. He could seem kind, he had a residue of charm, he knew how to be generous, he had mastered the art of persuasion. All these plausible qualities made him likable, yet they were insincere and shallow, merely strategies to aid him in his manipulation. And really this charm and apparent generosity in such a man was proof of his darkness. At his most sinister he seemed trustworthy. His skill lay in knowing how to exploit a person’s weakness. He would have made a great actor, a master of tonalities and gestures, convincing in every role he chose to play. Frank was so full of surprises that it occurred to me early on (and the thought persisted throughout my life) that though he was my brother, and we’d grown up in the same house, I did not know him. But one day he offered a glimpse of his heart. I was in grad school, pursuing my studies as a prospector; and Frank, in his last year of law school, for the first time took an interest in my career. He was swayed by one word. We were home for Thanksgiving, raking leaves in the driveway, while Mother roasted the turkey and, in Dad’s memory, made his signature dish, a poutine his Quebecois mother had made for him, but one that Mother disparaged as “peasant food.” It was a mass of French fries topped with cheese and brown gravy—hearty but not much to look at. While we were raking, Frank asked about my classes. I mentioned metallurgy and chemistry, X-ray diffraction and assaying. He misheard this last word as “essay,” and so I explained what it was and that I wanted to buy my own assay kit, which included a small furnace. “To what end?” he said, skeptical when I mentioned the price. “Gold,” I said. That was the word. It silenced him, it gave his face a look of hunger and his eyes traced a sort of pattern on my face as though trying to read my expression or penetrate a secret. His fingers twitched on the handle of his rake, clutching motions that matched his hungry face. I had uttered a magic word. I tried not to smile, because the emotion throbbing in him was one of the oldest in the world. Yet all I had told him was my simple ambition as a student of mines and metallurgy—to look for gold, or platinum, or copper, much as a lawyer might look for clients. In an old historical novel about an early European voyage, I once came across the sentence “Precious metals excited the greed of conquest.” There it is in a few words: the history of world exploration and colonization, the politics of plunder, the lust for gold. For the Spanish in the Americas, the Portuguese in Africa and India, the Dutch in the Indies, the English, too, the quest for gold was paramount. De Soto looked for gold in Tennessee but didn’t find it. Cortés massacred the Aztecs for gold, Pizarro killed the Inca king Atahualpa because the Incas, too, were gold seekers, and Atahualpa’s throne was made of 183 pounds of gold. In 1595, the Spanish captain Mendaña sailed thePacific Ocean from Peru to the Solomon Islands looking for gold; that same year, Sir Walter Raleigh crossed the Atlantic and splashed his way up the Orinoco River in search of El Dorado—the Golden Man in his fabled City of Gold. Twenty years later, in 1614, John Smith tacked up and down the New England coast, tramping the dunes, for gold. Gold in China, gold in New Guinea, the Gold Rush in California, and fifty years later the gold rush in the Klondike area of the Yukon. I did not tell Frank any of this; I knew it from my geology courses—the quest for precious metal was as old as humankind. A gold bead ornament found in Bulgaria was determined to be 6,500 years old. “What?” I said, because Frank had not said anything but was still running his tongue over his lips and swallowing, as though in the throes of gold fever. “Gold,” he whispered. “Dentists need it, you find it in electronics—gold is a great conductor,” I said in a matter-of-fact tone, the way you might talk about plastic or rubber. “It’s in medicine. It helps treat arthritis. Oh, yeah, and jewelry.” “That’s what you’re studying?” “One of the metals,” I said, more casually, because I had his attention. “There are other precious metals. Palladium. Iridium. Osmium. Your pen nib is probably osmium. Lots of that stuff in Alaska.” He was swallowing urgently, he did not know what to ask, but he wore a fixed expression of longing—one of the rare instances when I could read his mind. “Dinner’s ready!” Mother called from the porch. Frank did not move. He was staring at me with greedy eyes, and he looked at me differently after that, as someone who, after a long journey, might return with a sack of gold. I was puzzled by that lunch. He dislikes me, I thought, and went no further, because who wants to enter the head of the person who hates you? But it also occurred to me that he might have had a stomach upset—he tended to be bilious in every sense—and maybe it was too painful for him to talk about. Maybe he was depressed, though apart from the divorce from his first wife long ago and a period of deep gloom, I’d never known Frank to be depressed. He made a point of being jaunty, especially in his cruel teasing. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and began to think I was reading too much into his ambiguous stories and his uneaten meal. That plate he’d left, however—the mass of food, that slop—disturbed me. He had hovered over the plate, lumped it and pushed it around, making it his own, then rejected it, making a sort of statement I needed to interpret—very Frank. Yet my birthday. He had not mentioned it, nor had he given me a present, even a token, as he had often done in the past, like the key chain, or baseball cap, or ballpoint pen, logo items he’d gotten for free at luxury hotels. I knew they were cheesy mementos he’d regifted, yet they showed he remembered. And my cobalt strike, the Idaho mine, a big payday—he had not said anything about that either; and stories of speculation, which mentioned me, had been in the business news that Frank habitually read when trawling for clients. He had not asked about Vita, and in the past he had never failed to do so. You think: Odd not to mention any of this, but one of Frank’s perversities was emphasizing the importance of something by not bringing it up. I wondered whether that was the case at this lunch, and of course there was the sight of his mangled plate of food that he’d left looking punished, an obvious power move. That night I told Vita about the lunch—the stories, the uneaten food, the references that seemed directed at me. As we were going through a bad patch at the time, I suppose I was looking for sympathy. “He’s a piece of work,” she said, yet before I could agree, she added, “But so are you.” “It’s my birthday, Vee. He didn’t say a word about it.” “That’s the sort of thing you might do.” “Maybe by accident, but this seemed deliberate.” “You forgot my birthday one year.” “I was prospecting in Zambia, Vee!” “Husband comes down with a severe case of amnesia in Zambia,” Vita said. One of the characteristics of a troubled marriage is that wisps of half-remembered slights from the distant past appear fully formed and offensive in the present, to be marshaled as evidence. “A lunch, Vee. A lunch where one of the lunchers doesn’t eat anything.” “Maybe he wasn’t hungry.” “The way he played with his food seemed hostile.” “You play with your food sometimes,” she said. “Vee, there was something unspoken at that lunch. It wasn’t just that he didn’t eat anything and told those stories about Dad. It was all oblique and empty, like a ritual.” “Ritual,” she said, doubtful, as if I was overdramatizing the event. “Of what?” “Of rejection. Like the sort of thing some tribe might do as a way of ostracizing someone in the clan. Except he was inventing the whole procedure, creating a tradition that had never existed before. The rejection ritual of the uneaten meal.” “Oh god,” Vita said. And that was the end of the discussion, from which I emerged unconsoled. A few days later, Vita said, “We’re having a cookout on Saturday for Gabe and some of his friends. Why don’t you invite Frank?” “He doesn’t like me.” “But I like him,” she said, which was clearly a dig at me. When I phoned him, Frank said he wasn’t sure he could make it and that he needed some time to think about it. “Frank, it’s the day after tomorrow.” “I’ll let you know,” he said. This hesitation was usually Frank’s way of indicating that he might get a better invitation in the meantime. Vita said, “You’re so paranoid,” when I told her this. I did not hear from Frank and assumed he was snubbing us. But on the morning of the cookout, he called and said, “See you later.” He came carrying a small brown bag, and when he doffed his baseball cap, his lopsided face became fuller and more distorted, as he said hello in a grouchy way to me with one side while offering a twinkling gaze to Vita with the other. He went to the smoking grill and set down the bag. He removed two hot dogs and two bottles of beer, tossed the hot dogs on the grill and uncapped a beer, saying “Cheers” to Vita. The other side of his face still regarded me with displeasure. Gabe and his friends waved from where they sat eating under a tree. Frank jerked his head at them, as he tonged the sweaty, split-open hot dogs onto a paper plate. “Mustard?” I said. “Bad for you. High fructose corn syrup,” he said to me, while his eyes searched for Vita. “I wish there was something I could do to please you.” Walking away, Frank said, “Piss in one hand, and make that wish with the other, and see which one fills up faster.” As he stood at the far end of the swimming pool, drinking his second beer, I thought: He is here, but he is not here. And that was when Vita went over to him. They were too far away for me to hear anything they said, though once or twice Vita glanced at me, then looked back at Frank. And the way they stood, laughing, poking each other, they looked like husband and wife, or lovers. Frank left, taking his brown bag and his two empty beer bottles with him, facing me, wordlessly winking and raising one eyebrow—the eyebrow flash he knew infuriated me. “He hates me,” I said. Vita said, “Ever think maybe it’s you?” That was the second lunch. Not long after, Vita said, “I need to tell you something.” By then, I wasn’t happy anymore, so I knew exactly what she was going to say.

        "story": "Crooked November moon. The sky’s belly, torn open. The snow, spilling out and coming down. The first snow. Onto the midnight streets of Moscow. “Ash.” Wind. Flakes. Blizzard, whiteout. “You can’t grasp at what’s gone.” Stuttering down the streets. The inhuman streets. Trash sleeping in squares. Frozen corpses in the frightened mouths of gateways. Found. In the courtyards: people, campfires, whispers. “Forty-eight black cranes. Rose up. They made three circles around the Kremlin.” “Black magicians ...” “The entire inner circle.” “Did they fly away?” “The patriarch was with them, too.” “And waved a wing at us ...” “They roasted a bishop on a spit on Yakimanka Street; they extracted his lard and made candles from it. They use ’em for Black Masses.” “Chechens and Chinese. A new contract. Signed in Russian blood.” “And the Dzerzhinsky Division swore an oath ...” “They saw a two-headed dog on Ostozhenka today.” “They stole for twenty years!” “It leaked.” “Of course it leaked. At a temperature not lower than five degrees paracelsus, as they called it. They knew it at the plenary session, of the lower-basement ward through the gray majority, the last time the president sang through the Moscow windows. Sang in the orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre ... The criminal demolition of all heating plants. The black wings, the president’s administration and the new elite, don’t dare to fly out over the fatherland ... It is urgently indispensable to drill all of the anti-aircraft complexes ... and to launch grand, intelligent, and grateful schemes.... Anti-aircraft guns from the Second World War fill the throats with lead ... but flight makes a man freer ...” Evgeny opened his eyes. The helicopter had started to descend. He yawned, then took off the headphones and microphone. “Black cranes ...” “What, Evgeny Borisovich?” his assistant was shouting over the sound of the blades as he also took off his headphones. “Dreams.” Evgeny fastened his seat belt and rolled his sharp shoulders. “Shall I continue?” his assistant shouted, holding up the tablet. “The elder, the ascetic we’re going to see. He turned water into lamp oil eighteen times, and they’ve gotten so used to it at the monastery that they’ve started to sell the oil. Everyone knows about the three people he brought back to life, and I’ve already told you about the woman with the brain tumor. All of this has already become old hat for them at the monastery. Seven and a half months ago, a monk forgot to eat his prosphora after communion. And by the time he remembered to eat it, it had turned to stone. Transformed. That’s how his elder punished him for his worldly engagements.” “What kind of stone was it? Granite? Marble?” “I don’t know. The abbot has it. I only received this information yesterday, Evgeny Borisovich. The mind reels!” “A day late ...” “Excuse me, what?” His assistant hadn’t heard him. “Can I continue?” “You can’t! That’s enough yelling!” The helicopter landed. Evgeny pulled out a thin cigarette from a narrow golden case and looked out the window: cliff, sea, monastery. A white helicopter with an image of a six-winged seraphim on its fuselage began to take off nearby. “What the hell?” Evgeny arched his black eyebrows. His assistant glanced at the tablet. “The patriarch is leaving, Evgeny Borisovich. He didn’t accept the patriarch!” “How wonderful ...” Evgeny took a drag from his cigarette and laughed, exhaling smoke. “It’s ... unbelievable!” his assistant shook his head. A flight attendant came out from behind a screen, opened the door, and put down a ramp. Two guards came out right behind him and walked down the ramp. Hot southern air tore through the open door. Evgeny stepped down onto the stony earth, which was covered with grass that had been burnt by the sun, and, squinting through the sunlight, looked up at the patriarch’s rising helicopter. He looked around with the cigarette in his mouth. It was hot and bright. It smelled of the sea and of dry sagebrush. The sun beat down. He got out his dark glasses and put them on. There were two buses waiting nearby: one was blue and belonged to the monastery and the other was greenish-gray and belonged to the National Guard. There were two sparse groups of people standing around them. They were cordoned off by the National Guard. A little farther away, he could see a massive military apparatus, reminiscent of a crane with a telescoping boom. Four sentries with machine guns were patrolling its perimeter. Surrounded by his guards and his assistant, Evgeny moved toward the buses. Two people moved away from the buses to greet him: the general and the abbot of the monastery, Abbot Kharlampy. The abbot was wearing black and the general was wearing a summer field uniform. Evgeny threw his cigarette forward like a dart, then stepped on it with his pointed boot as he walked. The general was the first to reach him, walking sweepingly over to him and extending his long arm, which was as thick as a log. “He didn’t accept the patriarch, Zhenya!” “So I’ve heard,” Evgeny held out his narrow palm and bowed to the abbot as he approached. The abbot bowed his black-hooded head in response. “Yesterday, the president, and today, the patriarch. How’s that possible?” the general shrugged his sloped shoulders. “Any idea, holy father?” “I’m not a holy father, I’m a priest,” the abbot corrected him, calmly fingering his rosary. “And I’ve been telling you that the elder hasn’t accepted government officials or hierarchs for four years.” “Then he won’t accept us either!” “That’s possible. It’s up to him.” “Did you tell him about us?” Evgeny asked. “I don’t have to tell him. He already knows. And he follows his own rules, which we have no right to interfere with.” “So, he doesn’t listen to you?” the general grunted. “He doesn’t listen to anyone down here,” the abbot spoke, turning his calm gaze toward the cliff. Evgeny and the general turned and looked. It was low, like all of the foothills, but still almost sheer. A narrow wooden staircase moved in a zigzag across its grayish-pinkish-yellow face in three flights, resting on pieces of rebar cut into the stone. The staircase looked flimsy. Instead of a railing, along the edge of the zigzag was a rope that the climber was supposed to hold on to. The zigzag ended at the pharynx of a cave, reminiscent of a human face with one eye. From down on the ground, one could see how the entrance was covered up by stones, with only a small space left open. “The ascetic has been walling himself in from the inside for a year now,” Evgeny’s assistant whispered into his ear. “He cuts the stones, then hews them. He only has one stone left to put in.” “And they bring him cement from down here?” Evgeny asked, almost laughing. “Instead of cement, the elder uses his own excrement.” “That’s ... wise. Who are those people by the bus, Boris?” Evgeny asked the general. “Ah, the people!” an evil smile lit up the general’s sweaty face. “Those people, Zhenya, are our beloved public. The info leaked! Looks like they already know everything, huh? Government secrets don’t exist anymore? Why the hell’d they come to us, huh?! What a leaky country! Right, Zhenya? And why is that?” “Are you asking me?” “Who the fuck else would I be asking?!” Evgeny took out his cigarette case and opened it. “It’s better not to smoke here,” the abbot pronounced. “And much better not to swear.” The general waved his hand. “We get it ...” “And what does this public want? When did they arrive, Father?” Evgeny put away the cigarette case. “This morning.” “And what do they want?” The general laughed. “What do you mean ‘what’? The public wants an audience! They’ve already been fed twice.” “Okay, then let’s go over to them.” Evgeny made out some familiar figures in the assembled company. “Let’s go!” the general grunted angrily and stepped forward. “But, Zhenya, all of this is already, like ...” He chopped his broad neck with the edge of his palm as he walked. “Too much!” “Calm down, Borya.” “Yes, calm! I am calm!” the general snapped.  Tall, healthy, and narrow-shouldered, the general looked like an insomniac bear driven out of his warm den by problems springing forth outside. His arms expressed the maximum possible discontent: long and strong, they dangled menacingly as he walked, as if they were inertial balances accumulating the energy to eventually deliver the blows of a professional boxer, blows with which the general would reward this entire Moscow public, which had flocked here for whatever bullshit reason, with great delight. The ring of National Guard soldiers parted, letting them through, and a solid man in bright summer clothing with a handsome white mustache and a sleek, tanned face broke off from the gathered company to walk over to them. “Zhenya! Zhenechka! My dear! Finally! We’ve waited so long!” he cried out in a high voice. He embraced Evgeny, softly wrapping his arms around him, pressing him into his broad chest, then kissed his thin cheeks three times, tickling him with his mustache. He’d already managed to hug and kiss the general. Evgeny was entirely passive in his embrace. “My darlings, my precious dears, what on earth is this?” Without letting go of Evgeny, the white-mustached man moved off to the side. “Zhenya! Borya! What’s going on? Why have these good fellows with machine guns come here? To make arrests? To detain? To divide? Us?! To divide at this precise moment? My dear friends, have you lost your minds? If all of this is truly happening, if it’s not merely gossip, and I can already feel, can sense right here, right here,” he poked at his broad chest with his finger, “that it’s true, true, true, that it stinks of truth, then how can this be?! Wherefore this division? What in the hell is this cordoning-off?” A potbellied man with a face reminiscent of a potato tuber and an icon depicting Yuri Gagarin with a golden halo on his stomach walked over to them and began to mutter loudly, gesturing as he spoke with a short-fingered hand, which was bent into the shape of a trowel. “Russia has pupated! Its chrysalis has cracked! The dazzling butterfly of Russian statehood breaks free to reveal itself to humanity in all of its spiritual splendor! It soars above the world as a shining missile carrier, marking a new era of humanity! The physiognomies of Sergius of Radonezh and Joseph Stalin upon its wings! It emits unfabricated rays of Russian spirituality! They penetrate the earth! The voice of a trumpet rings out over the world: peoples and states, now ’tis time to repent, to gather up underneath the banners of the Fifth Empire and behold the earth’s grand transfiguration!” He was handily pushed off to the side by a man with a stern face in a dark-blue silk two-piece suit, a black bow tie, and jockey boots. He was clutching at a cane, the knob of which was shaped like a snake’s head. “Dear sirs,” he began to speak, manipulating his facial muscles with courageous affectedness. “You know that I’m a cynic, and a villain. Up until yesterday, I’d spew a daily Niagara of bile out onto our church and its ministers, but, today, I get down onto my knees before it,” he gently fell to his knees, “and am prepared to be the first to crawl up this staircase to the great elder. I’d even do so naked, sprinkling my head with the dirt from the side of this very road.” “We are dealing with an incredible lack of mutual trust and elementary common understandings!” a thin man with watery eyes, a prickly beard, a disorderly mass of white hair, who was wearing a carmine sari with a slanted collar, embroidered with Russian Orthodox crosses, and displaying a medal awarded for the defense of donbass, pronounced in an almost singsong voice. “Who are you?” the general grunted. “URA!” “What?” “A representative of the Union of Russian Art,” Evgeny’s assistant clarified. The man crossed his thin, sinewy arms across his chest. “We can and should talk about everything, not just whisper off in the corner like liberal mildew, we should talk every day, every night, every hour, and every second in order to understand just what a great country we live in and how much we can do together, how much lies before us, what a wonderful president we have, what wonderful warriors, generals, elders, and saints, fathers, mothers, brothers, wives, and children we have, we’ll overcome and solve everything only if we talk, talk, and talk!” “I agree entirely! We must talk!” a man with glasses, a gray mop of hair, the bearded face of a wise goat, who was wearing a checkered shirt and a nankeen vest raised his index finger significantly. “And what’re you doing here?” the general grunted discontentedly. “Reporters aren’t allowed.” “We’re here, Mr. General, as ordinary citizens of our country,” the shaggy man answered with a cocky half-smile, two of his front teeth protruding past his lips. “And we have an equally keen concern in all that which concerns you.” “Evgeny, please just tell us honestly,” a woman of athletic build with an enormous red head of hair asked in a voice that sounded like the Russian Pinocchio’s in the old children’s film, “is it all ... true?” Everyone froze. Evgeny paused, then began to speak. “It’s true.” Everyone standing around them was entirely still for a moment. Then began to stir—each in their own way. The paunchy man fell to his knees, crossed himself, and muttered, “I live to serve the Most High.” The man with the cane, on the other hand, leapt ably to his feet and exclaimed, “Wonderful! Fantastic! I was certain! Let’s go up the stairs!” “We’ve lived to see it, you bastards!” the shaggy man pronounced loudly, shaking his gray head of hair. The man from the URA grabbed at his sari with his knotty fingers and his eyes rolled back into his head. “Everything! Everything! We can overcome absolutely everything so that everyone can be happy and healthy—fathers, mothers, wives, children, even sheep ...” The curly-red-haired woman chuckled nervously. And the white-mustached man began to cry out. “Hold on, hold on, Zhenechka, if that’s so, if that ... if that’s true, then, ladies and gentlemen, my dear, darling compatriots, citizens, and fellow subjects, they’ll simply grab us by the throats as a wolf grabs a lamb,” he grabbed himself by the throat with his tanned hand with its two intricate golden rings, “and they’ll choke us, choke us all the way to goddamn hell!” His mustache trembled and tears glittered in his dark eyes. “Let’s go up there, my friends! It’s only by a miracle that Russia has survived thus far; let it also be saved by a miracle.” The stern-faced man gesticulated with his cane. “Let’s all of us, everyone, go up there together, Evgeny first, then everyone else. Forward! Upward!” “Shut up!” the red-haired woman screamed so loudly that everyone turned to look at her. She wrapped her arms around her torso trying to calm herself down, but couldn’t manage to. “That’s enough! Enough playing the holy fool. Enough of this squabbling, these disagreements, these shitty ambitions, all of this BS—vatnik, liberal faggot, European agent. We need to get rid of all this and rally ’round our president! Rally ’round the Kremlin!” “It’s too late, darling. Too late,” the man with the cane retorted spitefully, brushing the dust from the knees of his silk pants. “We have to rally ’round the general now. And just for a little while.” The general was silent. His bearish little eyes watched what was happening just as warily as they always did, even when he was drunk or lost his temper, but in his soul, with each passing minute, a black tower of fear was piling itself up, building itself forth from swirling black cubes. And it was growing because the general, having lived through three actual wars and a single long career, having grown steel fangs of character all the while and been reinforced by a shell of strength and spikes of glory, having raised himself up onto one of the peaks of Russian authority, didn’t understand what was going on for only the second time in his life. The last time this had happened had been in his early childhood, when he was five years old, and had seen a cow giving birth in a village stable. Everything that he’d heard in the last few days—from soldiers, officials, scientists, the president, and, now, from these clowns—called up in him a singular desire: to destroy all of it with cannons and machine guns, to riddle it with bullets, to break it up into little bits so that those bits flew even further away, to douse it with napalm, then to get into the helicopter himself and fly beyond the three seas where, on the sandy shore, he’d be met by his beloved wife, his children, and a swarm of coconut crabs. He opened his sweaty lips so as to say something rude, but a stone suddenly fell to the ground nearby. Everyone looked at it. The abbot walked over and picked up the stone. And shifted his gaze up to the opening in the cave’s masonry. The stone was no bigger than a tennis ball. And it wasn’t simply a stone, but a chunk of white bread, which had been turned to stone by some force of will. The abbot picked up the stone. A dial and an arrow glittered inside of it. An old, cracked compass had been kneaded into the stone. “A compass?” Evgeny asked as he walked over. “It’s his compass,” the abbot corrected him. “Please, let’s all stand in a circle.” Without any quarreling, everyone obediently formed a circle. With the stone in his hands, the abbot got into the center. The compass’s arrow began to spin, then stopped. The abbot raised his eyes and saw Evgeny’s assistant. “The elder is ready to receive you,” the abbot said. Everyone standing in the circle stared at Evgeny’s assistant. His young, lively, intelligent face didn’t express anything in particular. “Well, well,” Evgeny grinned and sighed. “Looks like you’ve got a bigger role to play than I do, Sasha.” He pulled out his cigarette case. “I’m gonna go have a smoke.” And he walked over to the buses. “What the hell is this ...” the general glanced spitefully at Sasha, turned away angrily, then began to follow Evgeny with his sweeping gait. The red-haired woman rested her hands on her muscular hips, then nervously slipped them into the pockets of her trousers. “Sasha ... Alexander ...” she sighed and shook her head, her curls swishing sharply. “You ... you ... I don’t know ... strategically ... I don’t know how to ...” “Yes! You don’t know!” the white-mustached man said, half-embracing Sasha. “So be quiet! I don’t know either! And they don’t know! And Father Kharlampy doesn’t know! And no one knows! So be quiet!” he half-sang out in his thin voice. “Sasha! The elder chose you. This is the finger of God. What a blessing! Don’t you understand, my dear? Hmm?” Sasha was silent. The white-mustached man’s chin trembled. “There—up there—in that cave, lives our savior. The savior of Russia! It’s a mystery! Which should enter you, enter me, enter them, enter all of us,” he knocked his finger against his tanned Adam’s apple, “right here! And we should accept it! This mystery! Sip by sip! And if it doesn’t enter us, if, if this sip of ... this draft of truth, this draft of God’s grace ... if we can’t swallow it, if it gets stuck here, then ...” he began to sob, “then we’ve no reason to live anymore! No reason. We shall choke. We shall suffocate. This shall be the end of the entire country! The end of everyone and everything! Do you understand? The Russian sun shall set once and for all.” Tears spilled forth from his eyes. “Dmitry Donskoy, Peter the Great, and Georgy Zhukov are walking with you, Alexander!” the paunchy man shouted, spraying saliva and stretching out his hand folded into the shape of a trowel almost all the way to Sasha’s face. “Don’t be afraid of anything! Here and now, next to this cliff, the fate of the Fifth Empire shall be decided! The rays of Eternal Russia have made the sign of the cross on you! You will help to bring our History into being and our History shall sing and make every atom in your body shine. It’ll shine when the great visionary accomplishes that which he’s destined to! Long live our great Celestial Russia!” “Run along, Sashenka,” the white-mustached man whispered very quietly. “Go with God,” the abbot made the sign of the cross over Sasha and handed him a small plastic bottle. “Give him some water.” Sasha took the bottle and walked over to the military apparatus. The sentries didn’t even glance at him. The captain slid out of the big green cabin and nodded to another soldier sitting in another cabin next to the telescoping boom. There was a metal cube of imposing dimensions at the end of the boom; its doors were locked. The apparatus started up and loudly released a burst of glaucous exhaust. And it was only then that Sasha noticed how the entire apparatus was resting slightly above the ground on six powerful supports. The thick telescoping boom began to move, unhinging itself, and the cube moved down toward the rocky earth. The captain walked over to it, unlocked the doors, and opened them. Inside the cube was a round, white plastic table. There was a black cone on the table. “There’s a button here on the right wall,” the captain showed him. “When you’re done, push the button and we’ll lower you down.” The captain walked away. With the bottle and the tablet in hand, Sasha entered the cube. The ceiling of the cube was a little higher than his height and it was very hot and humid inside. But the air conditioner immediately began to run. The cube moved upward toward the cave. Sasha put the tablet down on the table and glanced at the earth as it receded. The people standing on the ground silently watched his ascent, shielding their eyes from the sun with their hands. It seemed to Sasha that these were pioneers saluting him. ‘Transcendental.’ For some reason he thought of this word from Moscow to the End of the Line, the novel his recently deceased father had so loved quoting and rereading. The cube approached the cave and delicately docked against the cliff, like a spaceship, leaving only a small gap between the iron and the stone. The masonry of the cave became like a sixth face of the cube. And it grew dim inside of the cube. Right away, the lamps on the ceiling flashed into brightness. Sasha stood on the iron floor staring at the masonry with its single dark opening. It was neat; all of its stones had been hewn and fit together evenly, even though they were of various sizes. And there was only a single stone missing in this masonry. Through the opening, it was dark and quiet. Sasha took a breath, then began to loudly speak. “Hello, Father Pancrus!” “Amen,” a muffled voice rang out from within the cave. Sasha stuck his hand holding the bottle through the opening. “Father Kharlampy sent this water for you.” “God bless you,” the voice rang out in response and a cool, invisible hand took the bottle from him. Through the opening, he could hear rustling and movement. Then silence. Then the elder’s eyes appeared along with the upper part of his face. The face didn’t seem old. The eyes were distracted and didn’t focus on the visitor. “What has brought you to me, Sasha?” the elder asked. “A great woe, Father,” Sasha began to speak, then hesitated. “Has your father died?” “Yes, Father, he has.” The elder was silent. Sasha wasn’t at all surprised that the elder knew his name and that his father had recently died. He licked his lips. “I ... I haven’t come to you on a personal matter. But with a very important ... how to say it ... on a matter of state. A matter of life and death for our state, for our great ... our one and only country ... our motherland.” ‘I’m such an idiot ... what am I saying?’ he thought. “You’re not an idiot,” the voice said from the opening. ‘How ... shameful.’ “It’s shameful if you’re caught with your pants down. And your pants aren’t down.” This statement brought Sasha to his senses. Reaching his hand out toward the black cone on the table, he began to speak. “Father, before you is a nuclear warhead from an RS-36, a Russian intercontinental ballistic missile. There are as many as ten of these things in every RS-36 missile. In Russia, there are forty-three such missiles kept in a state of operational combat readiness. This is our country’s nuclear shield, a guarantee of state security. As I’ve just said, each of them contains ten nuclear warheads. And yesterday, something happened that science isn’t capable of explaining. Each of these warheads has two stages: a primary and a secondary. First the primary triggers an irradiated fission explosion, which powers the secondary’s fusion compression, which is ...” “An uncontrolled thermonuclear reaction,” the elder’s voice came from inside the cave. “Yes, a thermonuclear reaction. And there’s an explosion ... the explosion of a hydrogen bomb ... five hundred kilotons in each warhead ... So, yesterday our personnel realized that all twelve of the missiles in the Far East had stopped emitting X-rays. Which is to say they were no longer radioactive. Upon dismantling one of the warheads, it became clear that all of the warheads made of uranium-235 and lithium deuteride had turned into refined sugar. Robust, transparent refined sugar. All one hundred and twenty warheads had become ...” “Sugar-heads.” “Yes,” Sasha licked his lips and stopped talking. The sound of the elder’s chewing came forth from the cave. He’d begun to eat something loudly and to sip water from the bottle with audible pleasure. Sasha stood silently, listening to how patiently the elder ate and drank. “Father Pancrus,” Sasha began again. “Nobody understands what happened. No one could’ve switched out all of those warheads. It’s ... simply inexplicable. And there’s something else: in the areas where the RS-36 missiles are kept, many people saw flocks of strange birds ... strangely colored birds. It might have been cranes or seagulls, strangely colored seagulls or cranes, orange and blue ... Both civilians and military personnel saw them. The locals’ve never seen birds like this in their area.” The elder chewed. “This incident is a threat to the security of our country and could expose all of us to a terrible catastrophe. Russia could lose its nuclear shield and, with it, its guarantee of state security.” The elder stopped chewing, took a drink, then cleared his throat. “Can you explain it?” Sasha asked. The elder was silent. “Can you help? Everyone knows that, with divine aid, you’re able to create ... to do ... to accomplish incredible things.” The elder was silent. Sasha sighed. “We have no one else to turn to, Father Pancrus.” The ascetic’s face popped into the opening in the masonry. “What do you have there on the table?” Sasha looked at the table. “These are fragments of the former warheads. Now it’s just sugar. In order to demonstrate, we’ve brought ...” A gurgling sound came forth from the cave, then a hand appeared holding an enameled mug. “I haven’t had my tea with sugar for a long time. Break me off a bit, Sasha.” Sasha took the dirty blue-enameled mug, the edges of which were peeling. It was filled with water from the bottle he’d just given the elder. Dry tea leaves floated on its surface, having apparently just been dropped into the mug by the elder. But just as Sasha turned to the table, the water in the mug began to boil. Sasha froze and stared at the boiling water. The water was really boiling. The mug began to heat up. Sasha carefully put the mug down onto the table. The water came to a full boil, then calmed down. Sasha stared fixedly into the blue mug. “Break off a piece and drop it into the tea.” Coming to his senses, Sasha picked up a piece of the translucent sphere and tried to break off a small fragment, but wasn’t able to. The sugar was robust. Sasha hit the table with the sugar. Two fragments broke off of it. He dropped them into the mug. Picked it up. It was hot. Sasha proffered the mug through the opening. The ascetic’s hand took the mug. The ascetic looked down. Sasha heard him blowing on the tea. He took a sip. “How glorious ...” As the elder drank, blowing on the water and snorting, Sasha stood staring at his face through the opening in the masonry. The ascetic kept looking up, then looking down. But even when his eyes were looking straight through the opening, they were still not focused on Sasha, as if he were looking straight through him. Time passed. The air conditioner in the cube continued working, exuding cold air. Its current blew directly onto Sasha’s back, but this didn’t make him more comfortable; it actually bothered him. The stream of air, the plastic table with the black warhead and the bits of sugar, the hastily welded iron walls with four bright lamps on top of them, and, yes, even Sasha himself in the blue suit he wore to work, his ash-colored French tie, and his English shoes, all of this was somehow stupid and ridiculous in front of the rough masonry, the missing stone, and the elder’s face. The ascetic kept sipping at his tea, smacking his lips, mumbling something, sipping again, smacking again, mumbling again ... And with each sound he made, a feeling of helpless irritation grew in Sasha. He hadn’t slept last night—a crazy night full of stressed people, unbelievable commotion, endless texting, and conversations that turned into shouting matches. What was now happening in this foolish cube felt like a dream falling forth directly from the night. Sasha really wanted to wake up. But suddenly he fell to his knees. He began to speak loudly. “Listen, Father Pancrus! You know where we live, in what country, under what state. Everything here is as it were. Calm, as it were, will, as it were, law, as it were, order, as it were, the tsar, as it were, boyars, as it were, servants, as it were, nobles, as it were, the church, as it were, kindergarten, as it were, school, as it were, parliament, as it were, court, as it were, hospitals, as\nit were, meat, as it were, planes, as it were, vodka, as it were, business, as it were, cars, as it were, factories, as it were, roads, as it were, cemeteries, as it were, pensions, as it were, cheese, as it were, peace, as it were, war, as it were, motherland, as it were.” The recluse stopped sipping at his tea. Sasha continued, his voice filled with bitterness and trembling. “The only real thing we have is this warhead here. Only this uranium, only this lithium deuteride. It does what it’s supposed to do. But if it also becomes as it were, then we won’t have anything at all. There’ll be an enormous empty space. You ... you can transmogrify matter. You have unbelievable abilities. You’re a great ascetic. I’m begging you: turn this sugar back into uranium, back into lithium deuteride. So that we can be as we were before. All of Russia asks you to do this.” He stopped speaking and continued to tremble. It became quiet in the cave. Then the hand with the mug popped back into the opening. “Come on, Sashok, have a drink!” the elder pronounced loudly. Sasha got up from his knees with some difficulty. His legs were trembling. He took the hot mug with both hands, afraid to drop it. His hands were shaking violently. He brought the mug to his lips and took a sip, banging his teeth against the peeling enamel of its rim. The tea was terribly sweet. And very delicious. Like it was in his childhood. The tea calmed him down. Sasha took a deep breath. And another sip. “Finish it!” the elder ordered. Sasha finished it both dutifully and eagerly. Proffered the mug through the opening in the masonry. “Keep it for yourself,” the recluse pushed the mug away. Sasha pulled his hand holding the mug out of the cave. It became quiet in the cave once again. “What are we to do?” Sasha asked. The elder was silent for a moment, then asked Sasha a question. “What is your missile’s name?” “The RS-36.” “I’m asking you what its name is.” “It’s name is ... Satan. Yes. Satan. That’s what its ... designers named it.” The elder was silent. Long minutes passed by. “Father Pancrus,” Sasha stuck his face through the opening. “What’re we to do?” There was a heavy smell in the cave. “Sleep!” the elder replied out from the darkness. “What do you mean ... sleep?” “Sleep.” “Why?” “So that you have more dreams.” Sasha took a deep breath and came to his senses. Opened his mouth to ask what that meant, but the elder spoke first. “Run along. Go to sleep!” In the cave, he heard fussing, grunting, and muttering. Then everything went quiet. Sasha simply stood there with the mug in hand, staring through the warm opening. Some time passed. A stone suddenly appeared in the opening. And closed it up entirely. He stood with his gaze fixed on the cave’s dull masonry. The foolish air conditioner kept humming and blowing, air flowing right onto his back. Sasha banged the mug against the stones. “Father Pancrus.” No sound came from behind the masonry. “What do I do?” Sasha sighed helplessly, his hands falling to his sides. The wall stood dully before him. He wanted to spit on it. “Tell me!” Sasha cried furiously, smashing the mug against the stones. He heard a faint, dull murmur behind the wall. It was barely audible. Sasha put his ear to the stones. And couldn’t precisely make out the murmuring. The elder was saying something in a singsong tone. Sasha put the mug to the masonry and put his ear to the mug, remembering the last time he’d done this as a teenager, listening in as his older sister gave herself to her classmate, a bearded, thin, cross-eyed guy who taught Sasha how to drink vodka and always played the song by Sergey Nikitin, “Take Me Across the Maidan,” on his guitar. The elder was singing something in his dull cave, a soft, indecipherable couplet. Then went completely quiet. Sasha hit the mug against the wall again. And realized there was nothing more to wait for. He looked around and pressed the button on the wall. The cube shuddered and began to move downward. Floated down to the ground. The light went off in the cube. Sasha was in total darkness. With the mug in hand, he stepped out of the cube and onto the ground. And saw that night had already fallen. The apparatus stopped humming. There was a light shining in the cabin. One soldier was visible. But the light soon went out there as well. Sasha tried to see his surroundings through the pitch-black southern darkness. The air was simultaneously warm and chill. Cicadas were singing in the bushes. The surf rustled in the distance. The moon came out from behind a single cloud and illuminated everything around him: the cliff and the apparatus. And people sleeping on the ground. Sasha walked over to them. The general was lying down on his back, his legs and arms outstretched, and snoring loudly and evenly. The paunchy man’s head was resting on the general’s left leg. He was snoring noisily, mumbling and squelching his lips together, and the moon illuminated the icon on his stomach. The white-mustached man’s head was resting on the general’s right leg. He was moaning quietly and plaintively, his body shuddering periodically. Evgeny was sleeping next to him. His legs were wrapped tightly around the goat-bearded man, who was whistling through his nose. The man from the URA was lying here, too, pressing his cheek against Evgeny’s hip. Next to him, the man with the stern face was spread out, his palm positioned beneath the general’s head and his feet in their jockey boots positioned over the white-mustached man’s back. The red-haired lady was sleeping on the goat-bearded man’s buttocks, as if they were a pillow. The National Guard soldiers, the captain, and the general’s adjutant were sleeping off in the distance. The abbot was sleeping leaned against the rock of the cliff. A ray of sun rising over the Ionian Sea touched the tips of the feathers of the slumbering leader of a flock of swans. It brought its head out from under its wing. Opened its lilac eye with its black pupil. The sun began to play over the swan’s plumage, which flashed with every shade of violet: from blue-violet to yellow-violet. The swan began to slowly raise its head: a pink-violet beak with a crimson edge and a blue-violet neck, each feather of which shimmered in the sun. The leader of the flock lifted its head and shook it. The sun flashed into its pupils. It let out a cry. All twenty-two swans sleeping on the water began to wake up and shake their plumage. The leader of the flock let out a second cry. The other swans began to cry out in response. It shook its head and opened its wings, as if to greet the sun. The sun shined onto its red-violet and lilac feathers. The leader of the flock shot off into the air. Its wings flapped against the water and its emerald-violet webbed feet beat into it. The leader began to accelerate. The other swans jerked into action behind him, noisily knocking against the sea, which had served as their abode for the night, and stretching out their blue-violet necks. The leader was the first bird to tear itself from the smooth surface of the sea’s morning mirror. The flock followed it up. Having taken off, the swans made a large circle around the place where they’d slept. Beneath their violet wings, which were dancing in the sun’s light, the sea stretched out emptily, except for a lone white, double-masted ship and the island of Ithaca, green-blue in the distance. The leader of the flock let forth a third cry. The swans replied and began to get into formation behind their leader. A smooth violet wedge rose up in the morning sky. Having completed another smaller circle, the wedge turned around and began to head north.

        "story": "That night, I was slogging knee-deep in the steely waters, trawling for eels, flashlight taped onto my cap, fishing net dragging behind me, when I snagged on something large and heavy. I thought, Must be a coffer full of money. Must be that a robber flung it overboard from his dinghy and then hid it beneath the rocks. I wrested my catch out, keeling over in the shallow murk, scraping my hands and bleeding them on the sharp rocks and the flotsam of the riverbank. In my head, I plotted how I would stuff the banknotes in a burlap sack and skip town on the very next train, with my hair still wet and plastered to my face, and with my teeth still grimy and unscrubbed, and with my fishing clothes still on my body—the musty overalls and jacket and galoshes that once belonged to my papa. I would not care at all what I looked like, as long as I made it onto that train. I would find a window seat and lean my head against the trembling glass, fogging it up with my sour breath, watching the dawn pinken and then tarnish and then turn to brass. It was past 2 am, the moonless sky above black as the inside of a portmanteau. The flashlight on my cap was feeble, its shine whittled down to intermittent smears of butterscotch against the dark fabric of night. I wiped my brow, mouth half open. A bluebottle dove onto my tongue. I tasted that familiar bitterness of its waxy torso, and spat it out. Now I bent over, and with both hands on the nylon fibers of the fishing net, I dragged it all the way out, across the rocks, across the tin houses where the townspeople snorted in fitful slumber, across the she-oaks and junipers and Cape chestnuts, toward my papa’s house. And all the while, as I trudged, I muttered and grunted. Glory be! to the rats and mongooses skittering at my feet. Glory be! to the feral cats snarling over fish bones in the gutter. Glory be, because it was a glorious occasion indeed—I would never have to make this trek again, to wade in the slime, to cast my net in the brackish water, to skulk about in the thick of night like a wayward ghoul. I would never have to haul eels in a wheelbarrow, to fry them at the marketplace, calling out, Two for ten shillings! My papa’s house furled and unfurled, high as a church steeple in some parts, and low as a dung beetle in others. My papa had built it back when he still worked as an architect, before he’d lost his mind and started wandering the streets and sleeping in ditches. Still, the signs of his decline were there. You could see them in the spiral windows that were curled up in the walls, like giant stained-glass millipedes. In the doors that folded in and out of themselves, like accordions. In the shadows that gathered everywhere, as though at a plenary meeting, so that what you looked at was not always what you saw.The meadow of wild pansies scattered on the wallpaper? The Cabbage Patch dolls rocking back and forth in the farmhouse chairs? The old man in the corner smoking a pipe and poring over his newspaper? All those things were not real, only fragments of my papa’s noontime fever dreams. I was feeling broody on account of the thing weighing heavy inside the fishing net. I suppose I was so convinced that I would find money in it, that I would finally get to leave the town, and this conviction brought me a sort of preemptive nostalgia. It got me missing my papa’s house before I had even left it. I filled a glass with ice water and nursed it slowly, thinking of the days gone by. Thinking of my papa. He had named me Rosalie, after his sister, who died in infancy. My papa never told me that story, but I knew it well. Growing up, I heard it whispered all over town. I gathered snatches of it from the hair salon and the community hall, from the schoolyard and the post office, from the Coca-Cola kiosk and the posho mill. The story was this: It had been storming one day, and my papa, who was fifteen at the time, had set out a tub to catch the rainwater. He did not see his infant sister—Rosalie—crawl out of her Moses basket, where she had been sucking on a blemished banana. He did not see her dunk herself headfirst into the tub. My papa found Rosalie like that, upside down, her little feet dangling out, as though she were not drowned at all but digging for worms or for a beloved rattle toy. Naming me after the dead child was not an act of devotion as one might think, but rather an act of contrition. Each time my papa called out my name, he remembered what he had done in the old time, and he retreated acrimoniously unto himself. I had grown up hating my name for this—for the way it made my papa morose, full of old, undecayed hurt. For the way it stole him from the present moment and took him to his Rosalie. My mama had left us when I was three. She could not stand my papa’s terrible moods. She could not bear to be his second wife. His first wife, she said, was Rosalie. My papa always whispered her name in his sleep, saying, Rosalie, I will give you an ice lolly if you come here and dance for me. If my papa was walking out in the street and he found a coin in the dirt, he would glance up at the sky and say, Hey, Rosalie, look what I got! One time, he and my mama were deep in the throes of passion, and my papa stiffened and shuddered and said, Lord have mercy, Rosalie! And my horrified mama hopped off the bed, and covered her nakedness, and jumped into her Toyota Corolla, never to return. My mama sent me postcards each year at Easter. In them, she shared details about her brief marriage to my papa. About the ways in which he had failed her. About how she had tried to save him, and how, in the end, she had chosen to save herself. She said that his obsession with Rosalie always had the quality of a steamy affair. She warned me that my papa would never choose another woman over Rosalie, not even me, his own daughter. To me, these details were both intriguing and repulsive. They reminded me of a time when I found a cow’s eyeball squished beneath my shoe on the way home from school, and the sight of it, all scrambled, was at once breathtaking and nauseating. The thing I always wanted to know, which my mama never shared in her postcards, was why she did not take me with her when she left. I suppose it was because I had that same name, Rosalie, and it offended her to no end. I suppose she would look at me and think of the way my papa often abandoned her so he could be with the other Rosalie. How, when he went away like that, he left behind a vacant shell of a man, one that stared blankly at the empty wall, with urine gathering in a pool beneath him. I was ten when my papa completely lost his mind. He would be gone for days at a time, eating scraps that he wrangled from crows and rodents, and singing that cheeky song that got townspeople shrieking and covering their children’s ears. Johnnie’s middle leg is longer than the road to Kariokor. The townspeople said that he was mad as a cut-up boomslang. They broke off sticks and thrashed him, crying, Bugger off, you filthy prick. And if he could remember the way, he would stagger on home, still laughing, his face raw from the thrashings, his hair full of dandelion or blackberry or milkweed. His spectacles askew, his clothes disheveled from days of wandering aimlessly through the streets. Eyes shining. Two warm beers swinging in his hand, one for him and one for me. Laughing, always laughing—at the dickey birds hopping in the tree branches, at the urchin who was burned to a crisp by an angry mob, at the slandering neighbor woman who got turned into a neighing donkey. And he would roar out, saying, Lord have mercy, Rosalie! Then his voice would grow soft, caressing the name. Oh, Rosalie! My Rosalie! Over and over, until he left himself and went off to be with her. Absentmindedly, I had switched on the transistor radio. Now a voice, the poet’s, pulled me out of my thoughts. The poet said, Do you remember how blue tasted bent over the creek that swallowed Patricia of the thistles who fed her toes to the starving porcelain child? And red when we lay our heads down as the day grew tart? The wind foraged through the eaves above, startling the little wild creatures that squatted under the roof, making them clamber up the rafters. Cane rats and pangolins. Barn owls and spotted wood snakes. The wind shrieked diabolically, rattling the window. I fastened it shut, and now I took out a penknife and knelt over the fishing net. There was no coffer inside it, and no treasure either. It was just a woman, bundled up in an afghan of mohair wool. She was slight as a fernleaf. It was the weight of the afghan, its strands swollen with green river water, that made her heavy, that made catching her in the fishing net feel like catching something significant. In any case, she was dead, as far as I could see. The woman’s eyes were pasted shut with what appeared to be wheat glue. She had thickets of buffel grass for eyebrows, a nose like a stick of penne pasta, and her mouth was hardly a mouth at all, more like a piece of string pulled taut near her chin. I jumped back in fright, toppling a chair. The wind cackled in the eaves, but the little wild creatures above were unfazed. They stood still, and I felt the weight of a dozen eyes watching me. Striped weasels and black tail scorpions. Rufous elephant shrews. All waiting to see what I would do next. Tell the police? No, that would not do. See, they would burst in here, guns drawn, saying, You’ve got some of that madman blood in you, so don’t you act like you didn’t dead that poor woman yourself. But maybe I could dig a hole out in the grove of jacarandas and casuarinas? Bury the woman inside it? This would require copious amounts of time and sweat to accomplish, but I had both in plenty, didn’t I? I bit my lip. No, that would not do either. The trouble with this plan was, simply, that the dead woman might not cooperate. She might swell up and burst into a swarm of weaverbirds or red-chested cuckoos, which would then howl and peck my eyes out. I had heard of such things happening. You could not go burying people just fwa, without knowing who they were, meaning, if their mama was called Joyce Musanda Oketch, and if they’d had a hernia on their navel when they were younger, and if they spread Lady Gay lotion all over their body each night before bed. I thought, I’ve got to return her to the river. I knelt down and began to work over the woman, tucking her feet together, wrapping the fibers of the fishing net over her, binding her tight. On the radio the poet said, I don’t have no soul swirling inside me like fog over boggy marshes just ask my mama she made me this way dogged beast that I am all bite but no bark. And then, all of a sudden, something came, or something went away, and the room shuddered, the walls spasming, the light fluttering, but slightly, ever so slightly, so that I could not tell if I had only closed my eyes wrong and imagined it. Then I felt cold fingers stirring in my hands, and looked down to see the woman in the fishing net, not dead at all, and grinning like a horse, and chewing on a shred of something—string, or knotweed, or hair. She said, Look at you, Rosalie Sincere Were! I knew just who the woman in the fishing net was. It was the way she called out my name, as though she knew it as well as she knew the back of her own teeth. Called it as though she had both loathed it bitterly and loved it desperately for a long time. Called it just like my papa used to call it right before he grew morose and retreated acrimoniously unto himself. She was the other Rosalie. My papa’s sister. Rosalie of the storm. Rosalie of the rainwater. Rosalie of the little feet dangling out. All grown up now. She was what, thirty-five? She coughed out green water, and choked, and spat out a whole crayfish with twitching legs and quivering antennae. Would you please give me a hand? she said to me. I freed her from the fishing net and carried her out onto the wicker sofa. I brought her a tray of orange juice and saltines, and watched her lunge at it. I brought more food out—a bunch of bananas, five hard-boiled eggs, a loaf of bread, pumpkin soup, broiled brisket. Rosalie ate everything in no time at all, stuffing her throat as though she were a python. Now, with her energy restored, she lifted herself up from the sofa. She walked about, touching things—the architecture and design books on the bamboo shelf, the soapstone figurines, the framed portraits on the wall, the wine crate filled with vinyl records. I watched all this, thin-lipped. Finally, I grabbed my fishing net and let myself out into the frosty daybreak. I thought, Surely, Rosalie will be gone by the time I return with a fresh batch of eels to gut.  I waded into the water, stomping furiously, startling the snipes, making them shriek, Hleep! Hleep! as they fled from me. I was angry at my own naïveté, at my catching something hefty in my net and then immediately thinking, with utterly no right to do so, that things would be different. Thinking that I could finally leave this place. Eel catching had been my papa’s hobby. He would spend weekends in the river, watching the baited cages that he had built from wire. He had sophisticated equipment—seines, longlines, fyke nets, fishing spears. In the evenings, while stirring a pot of eel soup, he would talk animatedly, telling me all sorts of facts about eels. The difference in flavor between the ones you caught in the mud and swamps, and the ones you caught in the estuaries. The rivers and lakes that one ought to avoid because of toxic mold. The arduous journey that the female eels had to make, for thousands of miles, back to the ocean to spawn. I had become an eel catcher when my papa started to wander the streets and sleep in ditches. I needed the money—to feed myself and to feed my papa too whenever he returned home. So I trawled, and I dumped the eels in a wheelbarrow and fried them at the marketplace. Now fifteen years had gone by, and I was still at it. I abhorred eels—their slippery bodies writhing every which way, their slime that you had to salt and then rigorously wash off, and the smell of their guts, how it clung to me at all times, so that bluebottles followed me everywhere I went. Rosalie was still there when I returned home from the river. It looked like she had made herself at home in my papa’s house. She had moved things around to her taste—the wicker sofa so that it faced the window, the potted plants so that they were closer to the light, the bamboo bookshelf so that it was beneath the sloping wall. Rosalie had done other things too—cut the grass that had been so tall it had gone up to my chin; and smoked out the wasps that had lived on the kitchen ceiling; and plucked the mangoes steaming and festering in the tree in the yard, and then made jam and chutney with them. She had scrubbed the floors and made them glint. She had filled the cracks in the wall with cement and then painted them over. She had cooked up a feast, and now she set the table out in the sun. We sat under the surging sky and the trilling birds, with the soft breeze nuzzling our necks, and we ate brunch as though we were the type of women who wore pinafores and pantyhose and played footsie underneath ivory tables. I let Rosalie stay there with me in my papa’s house. It was rather nice to have someone waiting at home for me like that, with red lipstick slathered on, and with warm biscuits on a platter, and with Miriam Makeba singing “Pata Pata” on the radio cassette player. We hardly said a thing to each other, beyond “good morning” and “thank you for cooking” and “good luck with the fishing today.” Yet there was nothing strained at all about our silences. They were as tender as moth wings, and as wholesome as a field of wheat. We brushed fingers as we passed each other glasses of wine, and we giggled with our eyes and our mouths, and we told each other secrets just by gazing at each other, without speaking a single word. She knew, for example, that my mama had sent me a postcard when my papa died, that she had stapled to it a bus ticket for me to go see her, and that I had not. She knew that I was saving up money, hoping to one day get on the train and leave this wretched, waterlogged scrap of nowhere. And I knew that she had crossed the threshold often through the years, coming out of the ground and walking past our house just to peek at my papa and me eating eels at the kitchen table. I knew that once, she came to us as a housemaid called Rehema, working in our house, scouring our dirty clothes between her palms, starching them and ironing them. Loving my papa in fierce but revering quiet. Rosalie loved the rain that stung like nettles, and she loved all the yellow things that she could find—caramel toffees, and egg yolks, and honeycombs, and Lucozade, and rubber ducks. She was like an ordinary woman in every way, except that her skin was fine as the inside of a seashell, and that her voice box was located in her belly. This latter fact meant that sometimes, while humming to herself, the song in her throat dried up and she had to wind it out again by pressing beneath her rib cage. One day, I went out to the river as usual. I caught something heavy, much heavier than Rosalie had been when I dragged her out in the fishing net. I tugged and tugged and tugged, and the thing in my net would not budge. Wait! someone yelled. I looked up, and saw that Rosalie was at the riverbank, jumping down from the driver’s seat of a green Canter truck. She was barefoot, dressed in a silk camisole. Her coarse hair, which was dyed yellow, rolled about in the wind like a bush of dried barley. She launched herself into the river, losing her balance and falling, picking herself up again. She made her way to me and grabbed one end of the fishing net. She screeched with excitement as we sloshed out onto the rocks. I had caught an astounding quantity of longfin eels, each over a meter long, and weighing in excess of five kilos. I knew that it was Rosalie that had done all this—summoned to me such a rich and burly catch. Later, as we drove back home to gut, I asked, Whose truck is this? I had a lover once, Rosalie said. He gave me a diamond ring. This morning I walked to the car dealership and offered the ring to them, in exchange for the truck. Now Rosalie looked out the side mirror, and she frowned at the sight of black smoke rising behind us. She said, It’s not the most elegant thing, but it runs, doesn’t it? After that day, Rosalie began to accompany me to the river. Each morning, we awoke at 4 am, put on our fishing clothes, and drove out to the water. Always, we caught a lavish number of eels, and stuffed them into the bed of the truck. When the sun rose, we returned home and drank sweet black tea and ate yellow scones, and we salted and gutted the eels, and then we left for the marketplace, where I hunched over and fried while Rosalie called out to the townspeople, saying, You over there with the sorry face, I’ve got just the right cure for your ugliness. Six months of this, and Rosalie and I had made a pretty penny together. I counted it all, and saw that even after giving Rosalie her half of it, there would still be enough left for me to finally put my eel-catching days behind me. When I told Rosalie this, she leapt out of her chair, where she had been shelling peas, and threw her arms around me, so hard that we both fell laughing to the floor. Then her laughter turned to wet, snotty, red-eyed sobbing. Happy tears, she said, sweeping up the peas that she had spilled all over the floor. She got up, grabbed our coats and umbrellas, and started for the door. Come with me, she said. I’ve got to show you something. We walked through the woods, leaping over the stumps of stinkwood trees that had been illegally felled for timber and charcoal, leaping over the decaying corpses of Meru oak trees that had been struck by lightning, leaping over mud puddles too, with the deafening shriek of the daytime crickets in our ears, and with flying foxes thwacking our faces, and the bluebottles—the deplorable bluebottles—chasing after us because they could smell the eel slime trapped underneath our fingernails. She was still crying, which perplexed me, so I asked, What is it, Rosalie? She stopped walking just long enough to use the wind as a handkerchief, blowing her nose into the air beside her. She said, You and me, we have a good life together. But it can’t continue—I’ve got to leave you. Why? I said. Your papa can’t bear to be without me much longer. My papa? Rosalie nodded. She said, I can’t sleep anymore. Every night, I hear his cries inside the ground, saying, Lord have mercy, Rosalie, you’ve got to come back to me. Oh, my word, he sounds so tortured! If only you could hear him, too, your heart would be crushed. I did not know what to say to this. All I could think of was my mama saying that my papa would never choose another woman over Rosalie—not even me, his own daughter. Back then, I had thought that my mama was only a bitter, jilted woman, that she spoke out of turn. And I had resented her for it. Yet, now I saw just what my mama had meant. I saw, also, that Rosalie was exactly like that. That she could never love anyone but my papa. I felt foolish for ever thinking otherwise—that our golden days would stretch on forever, that she would leave this town with me, go to someplace new, where we would get jobs as secretaries, and spend our evenings drinking bone soup and watching Ousmane Sembène films. Please, I’ve got to go back to him, Rosalie said, as though I had said anything to forbid it. She turned, and cupping my face gently with her hands, she murmured, You understand, don’t you? I understood nothing, except that I wanted nothing to do with a love like that. A love like theirs.  We heard twigs snapping. Rosalie’s eyes widened. Look, she whispered. We watched as a dik-dik crept over the rotting foliage. It sensed our presence nearby and raised its head to appraise the danger that we posed. Shh, Rosalie whispered. Dik-diks scare easy. Let’s not scare him. Is that what you wanted to show me? I asked, my throat wriggling with the weight of a thousand millstones. I was fighting back tears. No, Rosalie whispered. That’s not it. The dik-dik went away, and we continued walking. It’s not normal, Rosalie said. The way you live. Out in the middle of the woods, all alone. My papa was the one that did it. Moved me away from the town like that. Give him some grace, he wasn’t himself. I shrugged. And I said, Why did you come out of the ground that night I caught you? Matter of fact, I came out of the ground a few weeks prior to that, she said. I came by your papa’s house and peeked in your window often to see how you were doing. And I saw how sad you lived—eating bland French beans out of cans, never opening the windows or drapes, and hiding in the shadows, pretending no one was there if a visitor came knocking on the door. I didn’t mean to get caught in your fishing net at all. I was only having a midnight swim. But then you brought me home and I thought I should stay just a little while to cheer you up. We were standing outside Dominatrix Discotheque. I leaned against the flowerpots on the ledge, my back pressed to the pane. I stared at Rosalie—her pebble-shaped face, her eyes that gleamed like china saucers, her jawline that was sharp as a butcher knife. I wish you hadn’t stayed, I said. I wish you had left me alone. I only wanted to make sure that you were all right. All right? I said, my voice high-pitched, incredulous. My papa chose you over me. He threw himself at death just so he would go in the ground with you. What do you think? Rosalie lowered her head sorrowfully. She said, He talks about you often, if it’s any consolation. I shook my head. No, I said. It’s not. Rosalie wiped the wetness of her eyes with the back of one wrist. She said, I needed to make sure you were all right. I helped you save up the money, and now you’ve got a truck too. You can go anywhere you like, start afresh. Isn’t that what you always wanted? Piss off, Rosalie! I yelled. I ran my hands through my tresses, and then buried my head in my palms. After a long moment, my rage passed, and I opened my eyes again. I looked into the window of the discotheque. I saw women in spangled gowns and kitten heels patting each other’s gold-trimmed coiffures. A serving girl tipped sparkling drink into flutes. Women slipped arms round each other’s waists and swayed to the trembling falsetto. This is what you wanted to show me? I said. The other Rosalie said nothing. Rosalie? I said, searching about me. She’s gone, someone said, startling me. The woman you were talking to, she’s gone. I turned away from the window, my hands jerking, upsetting a pot of angel-wing begonias. I righted the pot, gathered the dirt and put it back. There was a woman behind me, her arms covered in satin gloves so long they went all the way to her armpits. Her hair and eyes and lips and teeth all shimmered. Her skin shone amber, as though a hurricane lamp flickered inside her. Rosalie Sincere Were! You came out to see me? You came to see your mama? My head reeled. So this was what the other Rosalie had planned all along—to reconcile me with my mama? The woman before me was saying, Rosalie, I’m on tour with the jazz band, and our manager decided we ought to perform in this town tonight. I was hoping terribly, hoping against hope really, that you would come out and see me. How did you know to come? I lowered my head. Here I was, gangly, almost twenty-six, already gray at the temples, and raw on the knuckles, my fingertips charred, callused, my body full of strange, rattling objects. I smelled of eels the way other women smelled of jasmine or lavender. I knew the river and the sorrels and the bad-smell melons. I knew the brush-footed butterflies and the nightjars and the bush babies. What did I know about being some jazz musician’s daughter? Rosalie? my mama said. I’ve got to go onstage. Please stay and watch me sing. Later, we’ll have a drink together, and I will tell you a story about when you were little, how you always grabbed the mice that the cat brought in. How you chewed their mangled heads and spat them out like sugarcane dregs.

        "story": "Only Greg ever noticed the notch in my tooth, and only in outline did I tell him about how I got it—how Guin and I stole that couple’s developed film from the “J” cubby at the pharmacy. Tall and poor, she and I had walked through downtown Petaluma in each other’s clothing, our pupils dilated by one drug or shrunk by another. People thought we were fucking, or whatever mean verb they’d use to describe what bodies like ours could do with another, but the closest we came was sleeping naked. The closest we came was dreaming some vague man on top, and waking up holding a pristine, warm woman. If asked to explain the end of that friendship, I might still blame the night we ruined that marriage. It’s easier to claim there was one bad day, a cheap little kindness you can spend against the debt of one bad life. Guin was originally from Utah, spanked to welts for swearing against Jesus too often, asking about the looks her family had started to get at church, but I’d been punished more by chance, and silence. Little girl dinners I had to fix myself in the pantry, saltines and brown apples, on evenings my parents wouldn’t emerge after a fight. That Guin and I were poor, or unhappy, for different reasons—my parents boomer dropouts who came from middle-class security but destroyed their own chance of it, her mother a missionary never given a thing—didn’t register in the aisles of the Grocery Outlet where our families both shopped. During those years when I’d all but dropped out myself, becoming the gossiped-about mystery of the honors class girls who had been my friends, our miseries seemed to correspond exactly. I convinced myself soon after that this was closer to a coincidence, a tacky suitcase you find at a flea market that happens to bear your own monogrammed initials. You register the fact and move on, a little embarrassed that a part of you could be so recognizable, and reproducible. “You are unwell,” a client snaps at me, on what is something like a Tuesday afternoon, something like eight months into the virus. She’s angry about my suggestion—an antipsychotic, Latuda, for a pattern of intrusive thoughts about killing her husband—and that I’ve seemed tired, and elsewhere. “Have you even been listening to the complexity of this, or are you just another pusher? That’s what my fucking schizophrenic uncle takes, and I’m not a schizophrenic. I’m a good mother and a successful entrepreneur.” “I’m sorry,” I say, and roll my chair a little toward the screen to let her know I’m listening. “I hear that you’re feeling misunderstood.” The client’s thoughts have become the defining feature of all our recent sessions—how they intrude as she watches her husband take the bottles of formula from the fridge, or teach the five-year-old about the lawn mower by giving its different parts funny voices. A screwdriver in the neck! A gas leak while she’s out! They flash to her mind like things that have already happened, and can’t be helped. “How could I be running an award-winning yarn store,” she says, “if I were some dangerous lunatic?” That line I would have repeated to Greg, and it would have fed us for months. Oh, quite easily, he would have retorted in apostrophe, his handsome face smiling in a way that tripled my devotion. “Also,” she says, “I hate that thing you do with your tongue.” I start to apologize: it’s just a habit of thoughtfulness, how I push it visibly against my teeth, but she closes her laptop and shuts me back into my life. Maybe two hours later, as I take in the pond from our Palladian window—its placement under the side gable is unusual for a Federal house—my phone lights up, a spam call with my hometown area code. Social Security number soon to be erased, a voice says, due to illicit possession. It’s a good trick, on their part. They must bet on how many Americans might like it, the opportunity to pick up a familiar number, if only for the turn to say no!, if only for the chance to say no longer! Desktop Worker (Ban Bela), by Sam Bornstein Guin and I were waiting, that day, on a roll I’d taken of a dreaming, episodic acid trip—mostly of her, a few with the twenty-eight-year-old speed freak she was dating. We took turns slamming our palms flat on the bell until the balding, name-tagged Kenneth appeared from behind the curtain to absorb our complaint and disappear again. We rifled through the paper sleeves from opposite ends of the alphabet, bored with the same old photos of our shiny lip-glossed enemies—posing on Jettas in stretch denim, glittery thongs apparent, or holding each other in mirrors bombed by a disposable’s flash—and met in the middle. I found the envelope, but Guin snatched it from my hands. A childless couple in their early thirties, the Joneses lived near me, five blocks uphill, far from the sounds of the boulevard’s traffic that filled my mother’s apartment. He taught sixth grade and choir at a grammar school—unhappily, it was known, and pedantically—and she designed websites for people in cities. I’d only ever noticed the dog they followed in and out of their Queen Anne, a saluki whose elegance seemed gaudy in that town of hokey editorials and ripped, bored cops. I loved Petaluma, even as I looked forward to leaving, and felt a pride in where I was from, maybe trained by my father who had adored it, always honking when crossing back into city limits. You could see the Joneses’ dog outside the café where they stopped in the mornings for espresso, sitting calm and certain. The couple were part of a wave of others like them, leaving San Francisco after the tech bubble burst. They were the same people who would make it so the docks where we drank had gated fences, and the smarter restaurants took down their folksy, loving signs—one day they were pleased to serve you, the next they knew the pleasure had better be yours. The first photos bragged of their house’s restoration—midmorning singing onto lacy white pediments, molded cherubs floating at high corners. I wasn’t as compelled by it all as Guin. The subtleties of money, how it could be spent, didn’t interest me yet, perhaps because my father had been fixated on a lack of it. He was two years sober when he received his larceny sentence. A winsome barber with sixty college credits in philosophy, he’d run a scam he claimed to believe only hurt the credit card companies, not the customers he charged three times. By the summer before I left town, my mother was doing her own Sisyphean time, paying off the high-interest debt she’d run up the first year he was gone. There’d been nothing enormous: acrylic turtlenecks, a refurbished off-brand laptop for each of us. She ultimately declared bankruptcy, but in those years she was still trying to make it right, buying drugstore stockings for her job as a legal secretary. Soon they were going to change her position from contractor to employee, she would assure me, though I hadn’t asked. I didn’t need a doctor, and didn’t notice she couldn’t go to one. Clothes and books covered the bed she hadn’t made since my father left it, asking the same question her face did while she smoked. What was the lesson, could anyone say? For which occasion was she supposed to dress? It must have seemed to her that the moment she stopped picking him off the couch where he’d passed out drunk, he stood up quietly to become a thief. Guin glanced through the snapshots with her eyes half raised, awaiting the clerk’s return. Here was the brass finial, rising above repainted lilacs and blues. Next was a day at Dillon Beach, Mrs.Jones disappearing behind mounds of sand in mauve leggings, the two of them in matching Cal baseball caps. As we came upon the image of her twined to the bed frame with luminous black cords, her face lifted in devotion, the clerk reappeared. I kept his eye and nodded as he rang us up, knowing as I did that Guin had slipped the envelope down the back of her jeans. As he handed me our pictures, Guin put her hand in mine and thanked him so politely—Gee, I super appreciate it, Kenny—that he frowned in suspicion. Guin’s manners were a vestige of her Mormon childhood, a way of life killed as suddenly as her father was: his own gun, their garage, eleven in the morning. Guin had been eight, and lied to about the nature of his death, but she’d figured it out by the time she was twelve and they’d moved to California. A dyslexic who never spelled a word the same way twice, she was eighteen that summer, and had earned her GED two years before. After I’d stopped showing up to class, I graduated, barely, through some independent-study loophole granted to those with “trouble at home.” If we were free then, it was a peculiar kind of freedom—both the kind of daughters who needed to spy, we treated our own lives like something to be infiltrated, armed and blazing. The June morning was warm, but not severe, as we left the drugstore and crossed the bridge toward the old mill. Its steel coruscated above the remains of the railroad, which had once carried eggs from the town’s farmers to San Francisco. The tracks now stood rotting over the estuary—slow, brown, fetid water the town called “the river.” Back at my mother’s apartment, a flat sectioned from a Stick Victorian, we took off our shirts and settled on the concrete back patio. It was almost pleasant out there, with a row of plants in terra-cotta plastic, a wobbly glass table sprouting a crooked umbrella from the center, and two wooden chaise longues that could no longer be adjusted, their hardware rusted from winter rain. The only object that worked as it should was the ashtray, a metal contraption that spun and lowered, when pressed, to conceal the butts in its belly. Guin loved that thing, and called it the Forgetter. Memories, the drugstore packages said, in a bendy font that faded in thickness, toward the word’s conclusion, to become confetti. On the table between us Guin placed the image where we’d stopped before. The woman lay on her stomach, her wrists bound together behind her back, her legs held in a V by the cords that secured her ankles to either end of the footboard. Her turned face on the pillow, canted slightly up, didn’t look at the camera. As for the gag in her mouth, it seemed like something that had always been there. Sick, Guin said, as she flipped to the next photo, where the husband appeared alongside the wife in the mirror—one arm crossing her torso like a seat belt to choke her, the other holding up a whip. Guin brought that print closer to look at the leather cord, trying to get a real sense of its harm. I can’t look anymore, she said, after scouring all of them twice. We should do something about this. When I asked why she was so pissed about some boring softcore, she snapped. Anyone could have seen these, what he’s doing to her. If she believed her reaction to be on behalf of Mrs.Jones, I felt only a sad jolt of confirmation. Even if I couldn’t say it yet, I must have suspected the point of my body was its capture. Guin sat there fuming, smoke pouring from her mouth toward the sun, but I was as calm as I always managed to be during that spell of my life. Like many children of alcoholics, I could read faces very well—as a psychiatrist, it’s been useful—and so those photos didn’t alarm me. Anger, fear, love, or hatred: those feelings seemed as absent from the Joneses’ bedroom as any other clutter, silenced by the dahlias on the end table, or folded neatly within the lilac throw. I didn’t much see the point in looking for them. But then I’ve always liked explaining people’s lives too neatly, or that’s what Greg thought, saying that was why I got into my line of work. This isn’t real violence, I said. Guin looked at me then the way someone does when you brightly call them the incorrect name, long after you ought to have known it—hurt enough, by a mistake so crucial, that a correction hardly feels worth the breath. I went inside to piss, and as I flushed I heard Guin shout she was leaving, a nasty slam of the gate. These sorts of exits were occurring more often, likely in reaction to my impending escape. In the fall I’d applied to college—drunk, online, receiving no acceptances but one waitlist from a mediocre private school I knew little about—and when the letter came, I made the mistake of showing Guin my excitement. The brochure of hideous, brand-new buildings, the palm trees that screamed useless, lifelong debt. It looks like a bad mall where you can’t even shop, she said, a line I would use as my own to people in my classes. By then Guin and I weren’t speaking. That remark about my job: I think Greg made it the first year in Vermont, when we were thirty and mostly happy, chatting with people in the co-op about novels and politics. He taught rich kids classics at Deerfield, just over the Massachusetts border, and liked chiding them in Greek about ancient questions, being addressed as Doctor during coat-and-tie lunches. As for me, as the small-town shrink, I felt I was something like the masonry downtown—designed to protect people, but safe from being changed much by their lives. I loved all the granite in Brattleboro, the quartzite of the Gothic church sourced on Wantastiquet Mountain. That kind of architecture is hard to find in this country, where we were in such a hurry to get started that chopping down a tree made more sense than finding and quarrying the right kind of stone. I felt as devoted to Vermont as I did to Greg, loved its order and drama of time. That the leaves in October were as saffron as the snow would be white, that the mating bullfrogs in spring were as loud as the winter mountains had been silent. In northern California you get from primeval redwoods to sun-painted ocean in a half hour flat, piney peaks to tawny pasture without stopping for lunch. Sometimes I want to blame what Greg called my lost years on that landscape. Of course it was my father, of course it was my mother, but wasn’t it also that a day could feel like a year, that the scope of what you saw could explode one minute and shrink the next? Who knew what you were reacting to, the earth that didn’t need you or your life that only might? How could you trust any feeling? To my father, a southerner who still called the ocean the sea, that climate was thrilling. He had loved small talk about weather as much as the weather itself. My family was nothing like Guin’s, but there was one strange coincidence between us, I guess I forgot to say—both of our fathers had killed themselves. He’d told my mother he couldn’t do prison, she would repeat in the months after the call came from the DOC. And as with many things—how to swim under a nasty wave, how to hike down a steep hill and keep your balance—he had been right. The Joneses’ photos, I thought, couldn’t have shocked Guin as much as she paraded: we had learned hooks and jabs from a video we paused and replayed on my boxy laptop, and our party trick—she was more convincing—was to make the teenaged Spencers and Brians we knew, sweatshirted creatures with bong-water eyes, bleed from their noses without warning or reason. Local boys were friends, but little else: we had fake IDs used for nights in the city that felt like whole futures and required something like investigative journalism to piece together later. Oblivion or velocity, Guin had her preferences—already loyal to downers, she occasionally needed some all-night chatter—but I could do one or the other as if it were an aimless matter of left or right. For her birthday in the spring, we had gobbled Vicodin and sucked lollipops on the 80 into the city, playing up the irony that we might be girls who loved sugar, waving at sweet old women and calling them ma’am. I loved how an opiate made you aware of your lungs, the shallow breathing that courted those enormous sighs. At the Steinhart Aquarium, yet to be remodeled, redolent still with salt water leaking onto carpet, our breathing felt religious. We worshipped before enormous turtles who had lived forever, the shifting walls of fish whose only job was to be a certain color, and float toward the edges of their life. Oh, I love that ole dang squid, Guin said, kissing the glass, swiveling around to kiss me. Those drugs made her devoted to everything and everyone—on our way in, she had gasped at the blue eyes of an elderly security guard and said, Sir, are you aware you’re my husband?—but I took what I could get. On nights there was blow or Dexedrine glowing through our pockets, the goal was a room that looked like nowhere with a door closed to everything, paid for often with the tips we both made bussing tables. When we had less money there were men in tourist neighborhoods, harmless commuters or Cal State bros, who could be convinced to come along to whichever motel and pitch in. Greg would have been upset if I told him that part, or thought it was something like prostitution. There are so many nice, half-safe places on the way to getting rid of yourself, I wouldn’t have been able to persuade him, decent people who only give you what you’ve promised them you need. So much I didn’t say, and still he was the rare person who knew much about that part of my life—only because I’d had to explain why I’d gone to such a bad college, or could sip some turned wine without flinching, or would know what drug slang meant in an art-house addiction movie. We had met at twenty-six as Americans vacationing in Rome, passing down the stairs from the umbrella pines at the top of the city to the travertine arches over the gold-green Tiber. As a couple we were best when explaining something together, an idea or a poem, and could laugh until tears, holding each other’s elbows, about a faux pas or malapropism. The remark I had made in my failing French: Hitler and Stalin were one big problem. The time at a lake in Slovenia when Greg hardly glanced over his shoulder where I pointed, to a fire in an oil drum trash can, and the cavalier way he rebuffed it—Typical Slavic grill—right before some of the burning garbage exploded. He’d grown up wealthy, which made me feel his choosing me was a greater compliment, but the way my poverty came up began to be a problem. He wanted to be alone together, to have pulled me cleanly from my life into ours. I still don’t know if that was unfair, only that most facts of his background were not things he felt hunted by, and from which he had to cower, or stand up to shoot. The photos of us I reviewed without her: it was a ritual we typically loved, Guin keeping a hand light on my back. She was comforted by the idea of a record, evidence that her life went on without her memory of it, and I by her who-lessness, how in one image she could give off many people—the floppy wave of a toddler, the deep stare of real age. The day of that trip, we’d taken the 6 up from Civic Center to Golden Gate Park, where vanished, gray-complected men my parents might have partied with, still known as Fuzzy Bear and Socrates and Hazy Davy, mumbled as they sold most of everything for next to nothing. Those boomers were like the park’s cyprus trees to us, everywhere you looked, as unmoving and as pissed upon. There’s a photo of Guin, euphoric right after we scored, going down the nearby concrete slides—an oddity in design that requires filthy playground sand in the descent, to create speed, and pieces of cardboard you ride on, gripping either side. The day itself became a segmented spectacle, clearly divided into different situations and the feelings they radiated. I love boundaries like that, clean transitions. We peaked on the bus ride back to town, filling with anxious laughter we felt bounce down the aisle. By the time we deboarded we weighed nothing, and were no one. Petaluma was still made up of forgotten places, sheds meeting little beaches of scrubs and anise, and we spent a small lifetime in the grass by the abandoned Ghirardelli barn on the water, believing the river was not reflecting pink light but producing it. We needed to be free and outside on those drugs, because of how they could flip your senses—leaves could chirp, light could drip—and work a similar inversion on your life, a punch line you might hear and laugh at but soon forget. Well, I can’t speak for myself, I panted after a silence, face down in cool dirt to quiet the colors, fucking up the idiom, and we laughed for a year. Sometimes you make a mistake and it feels like a blessing: lucky and funny: clear and perfect: so much purer than anything you could work for. When we’d come down enough that buildings no longer felt vicious, we went to visit Tim at the bar where he newly had a job. Depending on the drugs he didn’t mention and I never saw him use—was he smoking meth, shooting speed?—he could drink to shouting, captious oblivion or down a twelve-pack with no sign of it. He spent his shifts reading, Tom Robbins novels and histories of ancient civilizations, sagas and victories that played in the caves of his face. The swirls and spikes of his hair seemed like an expression of his intelligence. He’d been accepted to Berkeley but refused to pay for an education he could give himself, a fact most of his conversations eventually included. He had the kind of fine, aquiline face I saw later in sculpture halls, and the Gen X slouch that went with their coffee-shop sofas. Tim could be useful and charming, playing us Psychic TV records and asking what we thought, taking us, when he had a car, out to the ocean, where he made a game of running up the high dunes—surprising us with a kite he’d hidden in his jacket, or reciting the bit of Eliot he had memorized. Maybe it wasn’t as much his age that was thrilling but his generation, the art they’d made of the T-shirt, the masterpiece of wasting time. Guin had been sleeping with him on and off for eight months. Sometimes he seemed to worship her, and sometimes he disappeared, and there’d come a tight coil of days in which Guin was always in my bed, asking anxious, funny questions in the middle of the night. Darlin’, when you finish school could we get a little house out down D Street, and have some chickens and sell the eggs? Do those Ren Faire girls think owning a lute is the same as having a personality? Are you sleeping? How old were you when you spelled your own name? During those sleepovers we’d roll around cackling, doing impressions of people we hated, pretending to fart into the other’s bare ass. Even my teeth wanted to fuck her. I could never decide if she wanted that, too, or if both of us did, whether it was for the wrong reason—that we’d shared everything else. The idea of there being some sound we’d never heard the other make, some face we’d never seen that meant exactly that, was as illogical as the fact we’d soon parcel our lives apart. Hurrying back to my bed on one of these nights in the winter, having gone out in the 10 pm rain to the store that took our IDs, we found Tim in the empty town plaza. He stood under an awning in a thermal and shower sandals, making the kind of snort he did at a dumb remark, over and over—except there was no remark, just the world around him. I felt Guin’s hand clench where I held it. His eyes opened and closed, opened and closed, seeming to rinse almost greener, the simple fact of us offending him. How could we have been there, went the blink of his tic, when he was somewhere fucking else? There was a string of screaming cursing, nasal and elated, and when Guin said let’s go and took my elbow to walk on, he followed us up some stairs and half a block, shouting and laughing for a terrible minute. Then he saw a left turn that somehow reconfigured him—he made a noise of recognition and disappeared without a word. Guin wouldn’t discuss it when I brought up these episodes later, acting like I’d violated his privacy. I didn’t consider how he must have treated Guin’s blackouts with the same hushed acceptance. Respect comes in where love should be, I once read in Tolstoy, stopping to underline it, thinking that distinction would be easy to see. Guin and I saw each other only once in our twenties, at the grocery store where she had taken a job bagging—I saw her, actually, apron clutched in her fist as she cleared the magazine rack by the bathrooms, not looking back long as she called goodbye to a co-worker. Had she seen me where I stood in line? I was twenty-four, and fooling people in medical school with the silk shirts I hand-washed in my bathroom sink, a change in the way I pronounced either and neither, and I reasoned it was possible she hadn’t recognized me. She’d gotten sober for the first time a few years before, and I knew she had suddenly married, an ex-con line cook—she’d worn celery green to the city hall wedding, I saw on Facebook. Other than that she never posted, and sometimes I tried to google her, pulled my phone out and typed Guin di Salvo Petaluma, as though she were an unusual domestic problem, and I expected the internet to tell me what to do, and to hear from people similarly afflicted. Her life was never online in the way mine was—just those creepy aggregators of phone numbers and addresses. She had so many, over the years. Crossing through the grocery store parking lot a minute later, I watched her get into her husband’s car. Standing on that same concrete, we’d once run into a former friend of mine, Sophie, who was star of symphony and debate, and she had sneered with rich concern. Um, have you ever considered just coming to school? Guin’s answer came easily, in the same breath she took me by the waist. Um, Sophie? Have you ever considered just furiously masturbating? As Guin and her husband roared by, I was ready to wave, but her face was pitched down, and it seemed to me he’d hit the gas before she’d even closed the door. Fighting Over a Butterfly, by Sam Bornstein The photos of us blitzed and senseless I left scattered across the kitchen table, some dare for my mother to find, and then I read away the afternoon. Guin showed up drunk two hours later, announcing her arrival by pitching her bag through my open bedroom window, reorganized under an idea she’d had about what we should do. About what, I said, as she took off her shoes and socks, making a grotesque face at her own smell, then leaning one cheek to the cool promise of the wall. She made a snapping gesture at the bag, gone enough that the pads of her fingers barely made a sound, and I threw it at her harder than was necessary. Moving a hand through loose tobacco and coins and fireworks, chapstick and condoms and shoe glue, she took out the envelope of photos, and I saw a new little tear at its fold. Pointing at the neat capitals where Mr.Jones had written his contact information, a Yahoo email address, Guin told me to get out my computer. I bet his AIM is the same, she said, crawling into my bed with the splayed limbs. Take off your jeans, I said, they’re filthy. She did, then held them way above her, grinning, poking her head through the two legs. Guin created a new account and added him to the buddy list, and then we waited, watching the videos we often did as we swilled the bottle she’d brought. Again we laughed at Kelsey Grammer walking right offstage during a talk, James Brown calling into a news show hammered, saying I feel good! in answer to every serious question, allegations of domestic abuse. These were our favorites: a man falling, a man refusing to fall. Would we have enjoyed these clips if they featured important women? I don’t know, just how in that grainy iteration of the internet, they did not exist. This only followed the pattern of the world we knew, triumphs and losses occurring mostly on the male side of things. There were clips of women stumbling and tripping, pert meteorologists accidentally drawing cocks that crossed oceans, but they were almost always anonymous—matronly or preadolescent shapes to be known only for the comical errors they made. When the sound came that meant a buddy had appeared online, Guin grabbed for my computer, roughly pressing the screen way back to squint at it. Hey, I said, that cost money. The alert was just our weed dealer, and I took the laptop back and primly shut it. That lady could be in real trouble, Guin said. That man could be hurting her. Why aren’t you worried about her? Because of her face in the fucking photos, I could have said. Because sometimes a small insult pays insurance against a larger, I wouldn’t have thought yet, because maybe to be primitive for an hour a day is to be in control for the rest. Instead I asked a vicious question, one I sensed she wouldn’t remember fielding anyway. She’d already dropped her bag onto the porch and put one leg out the window, and I propped myself up in my bed. Are you trying to tell me Tim loves you while he fucks you? Guin returned to my bed, briefly, mounting me on my hip bones. Give me your hand, she said, laughing, and then she spit in it, smoker-thick and wet, closing my fingers onto my palm. You’re gonna learn so much at school. I cried in the half hour after she left, loud enough that my mother came tentatively to my door and I sent her away, barking only Why is it so fucking hot in this house? Excepting the rare occasion a high temperature lasted into evening, she had the habit of moving the thermostat up to sixty-five at night, saying the early morning fog came in a cold draft. She was a thin, mysterious person, always putting on another sweater, never going farther than her ankles into the chilly ocean, smiling when I begged as a child for her to come, waving and saying she loved to watch me. By the time it was just the two of us I despised her caution, that aversion to the outside air. I would open all the windows and smoke her cheap cigarettes, shrugging when she cursed about her empty pack, saying maybe she should quit. I’m sorry, I T9’d Guin that night. I love you. You’re right. Let’s make that man afraid of himself. When I heard about Guin’s marriage—he had hit her a few times, she had left him, my mother saw his mug shot online—I felt a real victory for her, then something too close to jealousy. There was no good reason for what had happened between Greg and me: why he’d started sneering if I asked if he’d like to take a bath, walk and see the full moon, why I’d become some corrupt guard assigned to his life alone, asking what that look meant, that gesture, that pause, waking him in the morning to continue the argument. I would hear him brag about me to other people, and I praised him often, too, but in private he’d do and say things that I still can’t unsee or unhear. Their cruelty was almost hidden, almost elegant. I think you talk about your childhood for the attention, darling, he’d say calmly, but you already have mine. One spring he stopped wanting sex, would shade his eyes if he saw me coming naked from the shower, or wince if I squeezed him in the kitchen. By summer he’d moved to the guest room, asking politely for my help in hanging some new art there. Often, I couldn’t help it, I’d appear in his doorframe to beg and weep. Oh, here’s the quixotic quack again, he liked to say, rolling his eyes, often in the same gesture he reached for his clean, warm handkerchief. After he was gone, I wanted friends to say about my husband what people must have about Guin’s, that he was a bad man, or how it was something bigger than him, the drug he loved, which made him hurt her. But Greg stacked his books so neatly when he left: he looked only like himself in his old maroon sweater, crossing the lawn to his truck until the boxes were loaded. There was his pageboy bob I loved, his high rower’s ass I used to hold in the shower. We were married by that pond, we ran through that house, yelling some news that would make the other laugh. And all anyone could say, bored with my wretched mourning, was that he had been a person. I had tried to get Guin alone, the few days after she’d slammed my window shut, but she was always at Tim’s apartment. It was a top-floor one-bedroom he took great pride in, regaling us often with battles he waged against his landlord. That motherfucker, he would say, is dealing with somebody who knows his rights as a renter. After Guin had turned me down twice for whiskey by the river, I agreed when she invited me to his place, though I had sworn myself against it. The last time I’d gone, I’d refused to join them in the shower, and Tim had mocked my weak explanation. I’m really already clean, I had said. I stood there knocking a long time before they let me in. It was 7 pm, and I had passed by windows where families were just sitting down to dinner, fathers standing over tables with large serving spoons, children unfolding blue napkins. Tim kept his door locked and dead-bolted, and when Guin finally opened it, wearing a black lace bra and grass-stained jeans, she looked damp and peaceful. In his room he kept a bed on a low, imitation-wood frame, and in the kitchen a pool table. He’d been teaching Guin to play, all that spring and summer, and she took to it naturally, sliding the cue behind her back as if it were a part of her body. She was good at everything process-oriented she tried, tools and games and diagrams—that year she’d built a solar panel, taught herself fifty birdcalls. The moment I was inside, Guin crawled back into bed with him where he lay smoking and holding a beer on his bare chest. They were so far in their drunk they’d turned placid and kind, Tim telling me there were Chinese leftovers in the fridge if I was hungry, Guin asking from her place on his shoulder what the weather had done all day. I gestured to a glass quart of tequila on the floor and began to catch up. When I asked Guin if she’d told Tim about the photos, she made a strange face, as if this were not the time—then, seeing his interest, she laughed and produced them. If anyone deserves to be fucked, she slurred as he flipped through, it’s that serious prince of a dog. It was my thought that we call Mr. Jones, but I used words like somebody, playing in the hypothetical realm of juvenile humor. Somebody should call him? I said, and tell him the police have the photos? Like the clerk reported them? Tim spread them in a careful grid across the peaks and valleys of the unmade bed, chin tucked into his hand like the scientist he might have been. Oh, so they were maybe in my class at Berkeley, I remember him saying. I saw the suggestion as airy and unreal, only something to feel better for joking about—but Tim lived beyond that, in the place of real rent and real anger, and soon was dialing the number on speaker. The moment rippled in a sensation I remembered from childhood, of a secret feeling exposed by adult force. The malt ball I’d stolen from the plastic grocery bin, rich and perfect in my cheek: lost to the trash can as my mother demanded, replaced by mealy shame. Guin leaned back on the bed behind where he sat up, saying maybe we should talk about it first. She called him honey then, something I hadn’t heard before and that made me look at her another way. In it was a wish for peace that was nowhere in how she held her body, the muscled shoulders that appeared to meet the wind before the rest of her. Guin and I exchanged a look as he started to speak, something like a man as he first enters you, that tentative question of cruelty or kindness—will I hurt you or love you, their faces always seem to say, or is there something in you that might allow me both. Yes, am I speaking with Matthew Jones, we heard Tim say, sensed the pause and the assent. The voice he used was one he hadn’t around me, clear and clipped. This is Lieutenant O’Reilly down here at the Petaluma Police Department. I’m calling about some photos you took, reported by a concerned citizen. That’s right. Once he was really going, Guin wouldn’t look at me, just started to press her feet into the curve of his back. I could tell she was deepening the pressure there the more he refused to acknowledge it with any kind of glance back or touch, hinting at the kick that lived somewhere within her. Guin reached for the bottle between Tim’s legs, trying thinly to get in the spirit of things. And then, for a moment, she seemed as if she might smile, looking like someone gamely following a story spoken in another language—only a thought behind at first, but soon dissociated from it entirely. Well, my first question, sir, and pardon my impertinence, I think is the word, but is that your wife in those photos, or another consenting party? I see. And do you have any way of proving that? The man’s faltering equivocations came in a rush, making amendments as they went. We were enjoying ourselves privately, Mr. Jones said, and as far as I’m aware that’s perfectly legal, but I’m, uh, of course happy to help clear up any misconceptions, officer, truly sorry for any alarm. Tim went on to clarify that, because of Mr.Jones’s status as an educator in town, the department had a policy in place for anything untoward. However Guin or I had imagined Mr.Jones, cold with control, smooth with luck—he was something else on that call, namely uncertain on which part of his life he was meant to insist. The honor of his wife? The law as he knew it? The meaning of his privacy? The goodness of his heart? Guin made a noise, a horsey exclamation from her fat, pursed lips, and Tim shot his hand back to cover her mouth. I could tell she was tonguing his palm, and in retaliation he tightened his grip and pinched her nipple, moving the phone away from his face to giggle. I hated them and I hated everything around them, the butts wilted in glass, the condom wrappers blooming on the wood crate that was the bedside table. Is your wife at home, sir? Of course you’ll understand I’ll need her to tell me she was absolutely complicit. If you’d prefer, I can come down there, have a talk on the porch. No, Guin said, into Tim’s fingers. Stop it. Fucking prank, we heard Mr.Jones say in the background. Probably. Small town. I don’t know, to be sure... And then there was his wife’s voice, calmer than his, saying something like let me take care of it. Mrs.Jones spoke her name firmly, sincerely, and I watched the sound of it pass over Tim’s face. He hadn’t planned that far, or had only expected to move against her resistance—only to mock these people in an underhanded advance against their bigger part of the world. Saying something specious about protocol, spewing bullshit numbers, naming a bullshit code, Tim asked whether the gag in her mouth was definitely what she wanted. Are we done, she said. It was clear then that the woman had never believed his lie. Understanding this, Guin’s eyes were filling as she pressed her fingernails into her temples. She curled her toes into Tim’s back. Before she erupted—would she cry, would she hit?—there were always signs like this, her insides protesting their limits. She lived in her body as some people live in temporary housing. Unsure how long the arrangement will last, they ruin the walls with holes and marks, they slam the cheap doors. Tim began to speak in the high shriek I’d heard that misting night we’d run into him, adding an affected babying lisp. Do you hate your yuppie life so much that having your gerbil of a husband tie you up is the only way to come? Guin was on top of Tim then and slapping his ears, trying to wrest the phone away for a long time after the Jones household had gone silent. Fucking stop it, Guin kept saying, for too long after he had. As the phone fell from his hand and his giggle accelerated, I grabbed my jacket and pulled it around my sweatshirt, leaving his door unlocked. My hood was up against a thick mist as I walked home, and I felt glad to be obscured. I knew how soon I would pay for misunderstanding what Guin needed: to feel righteous about a crime that didn’t involve her, but was hers to define. To fantasize inviolably, and indefinitely, about some justice only she could dispense. Istopped going back to Sonoma County, in part because it lost its weather—I used to love that drizzle and fog, but now it only floods or catches fire. Guin and I spent a decade angry at each other, but the year we were twenty-eight we returned to our friendship and confessed. She had found me online and sent me a note rich in her singular misspellings, telling me only a little about her ex and the heroin, which always went unnamed. There’d been hard work and a little bit of luck, she said, but now! She was clean. She was new. We talked about Suboxone and her first-ever bout as a single person, the audiobooks she loved on politics and psychology, the granny unit she had triumphantly rented, a few towns over from Petaluma, despite bad credit and an eviction and a mug shot on her record. Once a month, for most of six, we’d skype—the internet was another one now, capable of bringing our lives closer together, but still faulty enough that her face might slow down, her language stop. I don’t know what happened, I notice everyone always rushing to say, just as Guin and I did, after a connection drops. Why? Don’t we know exactly what happened, that the kind of intimacy made possible by twitching screen is improbable to begin with? That if you know behind you is the safety or danger of your own home, that if you can’t smell someone starting to sweat, or see the way they curl their fingers when they mention a certain person’s name, the version of life you get and give can’t really be trusted? That’s what happened with Guin and me, ultimately. During a conversation that was creaking anyway—she seemed far away as she was, and was answering most questions about the past few weeks with a limited set of good, okay, and not the best—her face poured into bits. Two minutes later, she took advantage of the conversation restarting to ask about me. Were my patients behaving themselves? As I began to describe a client’s unique delusion, Guin’s husband called her name, and then he moved onscreen to kiss her forehead. Anything from the store, babe? She blushed deeply, saying something quickly about smokes, and sent him away. We were silent a long time, the country between us redrawing our faces in pixelated revolutions if she shifted or I did. She apologized first for the state of the connection, saying the internet was bad in what she called west county. They’d gotten back together a few months before, she admitted, when they both were sober, and I knew, I knew—I knew—by the way her glance fell that they were no longer. He’d been living there and they were doing sobriety together, she said, hoping I’d say something accepting—but I had returned to who I’d become again, and I refused even to ask how long. The lie had been as beautiful as she still was, but I’d forgotten how she smelled, that she was handy with a pocketknife—the time she had, with loving conspiracy, convinced a waiter to send a crying child a milkshake in an IHOP. Devotion rarely goes on without novel surfaces, isn’t that right? Without the grain of new situations it can be confirmed against. Greg, when I told him about the call, nodded in sympathy. He scrounged up some stained little words that we’ve all, in heedlessness, used. There is only so much you can do. It’s funny he could say that when he’d heard the sound I’d made, on that call, when I saw the face of her husband. I cried out in the way I do when I see a cockroach, as though it’s the first time and I haven’t been living all my life in these fucking American houses, built quickly of pest-friendly wood. If you get from one side of this country to the other, or the bottom to the top, you find out that even the wealthy are living in buildings that were not meant to last, and that the American imagination is selfish and short, and that the shrug we give when someone else needs something is a consequence of how long our memory is, and how far we can see into the future—and the answer to all of it is, well, about a hundred years. That’s how long the walls will stand if you do nothing, and that’s also the scope of history you’re expected to know or care about. It’s a friendly, easy figure, because it stretches just about one life, indicating any person’s decades as an exception, not a pattern. There are accidents of passion, here, not designs of cruelty. And so we go around chirping life is short!, which is a way of saying my life is mine!, which is a way of saying best of luck with yours! Greg moved out just before the virus, actually—I don’t even have that to blame. In the first six months of it, I seemed to spend my sadness only on my friends’ and clients’ lives, laughing at the right moments, adjusting their medications, often avoiding the diagnoses that would do little to help them and everything to set them against me. You tell a person they’re a recognizable type, you call a symptom specific to a pattern of others, and they’re likely to rage or turn mute. Few of us want to believe that our pain is so common it can be treated. In my personal life anyway, I’ve tried to select against certain categories, and have never gotten it quite right. Greg had accepted exactly one drink in his life—his father was an alcoholic, too—and I’d chosen his sobriety, his pellucid memory. Living with him I learned his religious tidiness, to empty rooms in order to sweep them. Oh, love, he had said laughing, in our first apartment together, looking at my dishes as he washed them, would you let me teach you? I was then twenty-six, and the undersides of my pots all looked almost caramelized. How funny that you never, Greg said, kissing me, learned to wash the bottoms of things. He was careful and tender with all his senses, coming home with dark chocolate and olive oil soap in his tote bag, straightening the rooms we slept in so that nothing bigger ever sat on anything smaller, and all the angles were right. But once he was unhappy, his tongue seemed to fatten with another decade, and his pupils expanded, as he stayed up all night reading the internet, until his brown eyes seemed only to be black. He had the snap of a drunk, the lurching impulses that hated to be seen. Toward the end I woke once, frightened, around 3 am, to the bed frame vibrating with a deep, frantic bass, Mahler’s Fifth booming from his office speakers a floor below. As if I were his neighbor, I knocked timidly, asking if he might turn that down. And he stomped across the room, slamming a hand down to quiet the noise, his eyes flashing that deep black and holding mine. He would say things I imagined had been once said to him (Do you think you’re the first person to suffer?) or pose a mean, specific question (You never got over your father dying, did you?) and behave with no memory of it the next day, when I might find him whistling as he cleaned the kitchen, or arranging narcissi in my office with a lucky wink. Even as they horrified me, I envied him those outbursts. Because the worst things I’ve said or done, and the worst said and done to me, have worked on my life more quietly, like some embarrassing, insuperable superstition—keeping me from walking where it must be safe to, assuring me I know something other people don’t. I waited an hour on my porch for Guin, knowing she would come, thinking of the Joneses’ house nearby—the dog who might be passing from room to room, wondering about the change in the way his people were speaking, the lights maybe not turned on at dusk. Through the walls behind me was the bed where I slept, the narrow corridor of sink and pantry where my mother drank her coffee alone by the small, high window. The unhappiness of my life in that apartment was perfectly tailored, shaped like the two of us, and I knew the unhappiness beyond would be a surprise for which I had no retort prepared. When Guin showed up, I announced straightaway we would return the photos. She nodded and took the package from her bag, handing it to me with a look she must have learned in her childhood—Was her sin so bad? Would she be forgiven? I could see in the streetlight how battered it was, the photo on top of the pile a little bent at an edge. I didn’t ask why the stack seemed slimmer, or about the tape she’d run on the envelope where it had torn, in some kind of apology. Even her anger she couldn’t really care for, or be loyal to, in the way so many people do for the rest of their lives, using the same language to describe it. My father’s narcissism was one of small differences, a client will tell me, again and again, seeming proud of their articulation. Whatever Guin’s failings, she never gave me the same sentence twice. In college I didn’t mention her, though I understood that I was desirable mostly because of the print she’d left on me. She had taught me how you remove a bottle cap with any edge, how you breathe around a cock in your mouth or run backward from a bottle rocket. You’re not going to be this sad your whole life, she had said once in bed, holding me from behind, her ribs bigger than my ribs, her voice clearer than my voice, and I knew it was something like an insult. She was standing at the perspective of distance between us she already saw. Even if I could drink to nothing with her, stay up on speed and get sliced to ribbons by hateful daylight, I eventually felt the need to return to myself. Faithful student I was at heart, I wanted the home in my mind that would ratify anything I’d done, convert it into some lesson or anecdote. In the middle of my first semester of college, I heard from my mother that the Joneses’ dog had gone missing. Flyers punctuated the neighborhood, using the word “love,” entreating the town’s sympathy. My mother admitted that she’d seen it—trotting downhill, one early morning she was half asleep and smoking out front—but its beauty was such, its certainty so evident, that she could not stop to worry. From her voice on the phone, I understood that she knew this was wrong, how it’s those creatures most easily alone you’re supposed to call after as they run toward traffic. Can you imagine losing your dog the same month you lost your job, she asked, but I wouldn’t take the bait, wouldn’t ask how or why. That was roughly the position I held on anything having to do with Petaluma, and that might be why we never really talked about the time after dad died, when she’d kept the apartment too warm and we’d acknowledge each other like roommates. Once, when she came to visit me and Greg, and he had slipped off to fix dessert, the topic did come up. Her thin hand grabbed for mine, and she smiled wetly in the sweet candlelight and mentioned those years and said, Someday, babe, when we have a sign the time is right. I did tell a friend the full story of what we did to the Joneses’ marriage, recently, during a series of Zooms about what she was willing to do for her husband’s pleasure. With the pandemic on, they needed something new in their life, but it would have to be a compromise, she reiterated, and I agreed: he’d been watching the kind of down, sex-pig! porn where women’s makeup forms runnels down their alarmed faces, and she was interested in shibari, if she could get the right kind of silk ropes from Japan. The friend had been calling often, and I would allow her to repeat her banal remarks, or call me back when her contractor needed to run through something on her kitchen’s renovation. Listening to my details of fifteen years before, she laughed at the mischief of it all, and repeated a line I sensed she had read on internet forums about that kind of sex. Sometimes the bottom is the top. Then she changed the subject. It had been so nice to say Guin’s name, but the friend had asked nothing further about her, who she had been to me or what she’d become to herself. The next time she texted I vanished the text, the next time she called I silenced the call, the next time she emailed I archived the email. I told myself I was bored by the conversation. False power, voluntary confinement, doesn’t interest me. If you add it up, the leather with the lotion, the cruelty with the kindness, doesn’t that only get you somewhere neutral? And that’s worse than being alone—which I actually like fine—given the lie of being together. All I had wanted, on that call, was the chance to say the outrageous, impossible words that had become true a few weeks before. It was the only conversation in which it would have been appropriate, because I had never really mentioned Guin to anyone else. She had existed before I became myself. It would anyway require so many steps down their empathic ladders, those lawyers and doctors, a series of bleak facts going lower and lower, deeper and deeper, and by the time I got to the phrase, they would have been worn out. Because first, I’d want to say how once she was sober again she realized her wisdom teeth were so painful she had no choice but to pull them and that two thousand dollars was impossible... and so her landlord had cut off the electricity... and when the virus hit she was living in a trailer without water, which was meant to be temporary... she had a good job at a restaurant but all but two of the front of house staff were cut... and the NA meeting that was important to her didn’t go remote, for some reason, and it felt wrong to start a new meeting on a screen, with intermittent Wi-Fi... and actually... She died. It was Tim who let me know, calling me on repeat from midnight in California, and I picked up in my sleep, as weak and confused as he must have remembered me. My terror, when I heard his voice, was so pure it touched everything—it made the rug I brought my feet onto rough, the books splayed all around me in my bed jagged and menacing. He said something first about Guin being the love of his life, testing out how it sounded. I could tell he was outside, and I remembered how natural he always looked near a streetlamp, as thin, and as cold, and as punitive. There was no euphemism: Guin had not “passed on.” “Four milligrams of pure fucking fentanyl,” he announced. “She never did anything lightly, which I have to admit I fucking admire.” That he and Guin had not talked in some seven years, that he and I had not in fifteen, that she saw my life as a put-on and I saw hers as a curse on mine—these things weren’t a part of the conversation. Shortly after relating some gruesome details, he switched topics, but I was still thinking about the week she’d been alone with her dead body, and only vaguely registered what he said next. He had heard I’d become a doctor, which didn’t surprise him. He wanted to tell me about a combination of ingredients he’d been using to treat a recurrent sinus infection—maybe we could talk, have a meeting of the minds, get it on the shelves. I could feel myself readying the condescending remark, that I was not that kind of doctor, that he hadn’t the right to... and then it drifted away, easily as an hour does when you spend it lying down. I couldn’t hold on to my offense at his having called me, asking myself in the next instant what I’d kept the same number for, if not this. You must want to be reached, I told myself. You must need some part of you that goes all the way back. “Do you want to meet up?” Tim said. “A drink for the old days.” Well, where are you, I asked, rather than answering I was in Vermont. I was convinced, somehow, by the short-circuiting of his mind. Even his ruined thinking was clever, understanding that I had left and couldn’t have really, daring me to deny it. “Downtown,” he said, like the answer was obvious. I clarified my location, apologizing, and he got off the call soon after, pulling the phone away from his mouth to shriek, “Oh, is that fucking right,” to something or someone I couldn’t see. And then I knew it, certain as the draft through the bedroom window—that if he’d been three blocks away, that if I could walk to him I would have, saving the buttons of my coat for the walk through the weather. The days or weeks after seem to fall down, their natural order like something you only narrowly catch, the save so close you’ve already imagined the irretrievable break. Some people go and you can’t imagine the bridge, how their bodies went from being memories to being silence, but it wasn’t difficult to picture Guin dying. She had practiced a long time. What bothers me about her death, the thought that cracks my chest open to a sob in the bulk-food aisle, is that I believe it so easily I keep trying to remember it. That the last place she’d ever gone was one where we’d never been together—it’s the force that holds me down in my bed until noon some mornings, and makes me wrench my stove from the wall to sweep behind it another. The fentanyl I keep in my bedside drawer, for months after I hear about Guin, an insult to her, I know—that I got it easily and legally and paid nothing, that I can keep it hidden in a room where I read and clean, sleep and masturbate. There is only so much you can do, to use Greg’s phrase, but in another selfish context—as in, only so much you can do of this drug, if you want to come back. The threshold is famous, the bottom. I know I wouldn’t have gotten it if he had still been nearby, in his tidy other bedroom, and also how lucky I feel to be alone with her—in my mind, I mean, in my body. “I just think you’re unwell,” the client chirps again, how many sessions after the first time I can’t truly say. “And I want you to know I respectfully decline the opportunity to work with you anymore.” You are the only one here, the HIPAA-compliant office software informs me after that, so why do I stay there a moment longer, looking at the frame of my life as it’s been presented? The window that’s best for western light, the row of plants we all keep to remind ourselves of an outside. Then I float upstairs, thinking I’ll get some laundry together, and I take a pill. It happens so easily: the idea of once has always seemed friendly. I could forgive anything in myself or in him, Greg liked to say, a compliment one day and an insult the next. In the depth of August, Guin and I pass up quiet, sloping streets. Outside the Joneses’ house, we stop, maybe hoping to learn something about that man and that woman, but in their lit bedroom the curtains are drawn, and all we can understand is that they are together. I push the photos into the mailbox that stands on a post, and we continue up the hill to the park we like, situated high above the rambling town. From a damp bench we take in Petaluma, the enormous grain elevator and the purple hills occurring all around it. You wanted to hurt them because they’re lucky, I say to Guin, and the underside of that sentence is that there is nothing she could do to make her life like theirs, but there’s plenty I could, and will. Guin cocks wide and clips short, and when I start to bleed from my top lip, when I feel the notch in my tooth where it will be forever, she laughs brightly as a toddler who has just understood that ice can melt, or green give way to blossom. She doesn’t tell me that Tim has taken some of the photos, and she can’t know that a few weeks from now he’ll be over at McNear Elementary in the middle of the night, supergluing them image-in to the tilt-and-turn Fifties windows of the choir classroom. It’s not her fault that the children who trot in on their first day of school will see those adult secrets, those strange expressions, as part of their view of outside, or that their teacher will seem scary as he tries to pick them off, cursing when he finds he can’t cleanly detach one part of his life from another. It’s dark early in Vermont, and a sound is more likely to come from within the house than out, a faucet, a radiator. As for my life, I’ve got thick, hand-knit socks on, a full glass of cool water, and a third pill, now, another half a milligram: it’s such a small thing against such a big house. Narcan in the drawer, she might have teased me for that, and fuck her. What did I owe her? A call every day? A check every month? A plane ticket would have been easy, an inpatient spell someplace else where her ex couldn’t wait in the parking lot. I could have given an apology for her life, not because it was my fault, but because it should have been somebody’s. In my bedroom the objects have been rearranged since Greg left, end tables and necklaces, oils and creams. There’s the rug from Athens, the vase from Sausalito, another pill on my tongue, then a dull, happy truth. It makes my ribs bigger, lets each breath go farther. I laugh when I know it! The absurdity in counting! Six? When was the last time you saw one in real life, a number? I can only speak for myself, but I never see a pretty wall of trees, or a stark impasse of mountains, and know there are twelve. No one ever goes on loving someone because it’s been so many years. They might just be a category, numbers, something that helps other people understand what we don’t need to. Somewhere under the covers, somewhere under my mind, we snake our way through town in the middle of the night, up and down the gravel of those little alleys, named School and Telephone and Pepper, seeing into the backsides of magnificent houses. Half-gabled, cross-timber. She’s learned to describe the homes of other people, faithful and tender as the owners must be, pointing with her chin tucked on my neck. Frieze, coffer. I kiss her for knowing, I adore her again, she walks deep into shadow, I go deep in my body, lick my tooth where she’s chipped it, she forgives us all distance, we come from the same place, we are parts of the same life. Maybe we aren’t girls, surely we were never children, but we might have the talents of animals, sensing everything that wants to kill us, and that we need to kill. Hills aren’t a problem, gates we can perch on, dark we can see in, and now we’re quiet by the glow of that couple’s back window. What’s the ancient idea, we’ve read it somewhere, we turn in the chilly bed to find it, we turn her face in the light of other lives to tell her. We’re born knowing everything, which is why we wail. We begin to forget, which is how we can stop. And here’s the thing: here’s the thing: here’s the strangest, loving thing, which helps until it doesn’t, which is kind until it’s wicked: At the end of your life, you’ve forgotten the most.

        "story": "Baumgartner is sitting at his desk in the second-floor room he variously refers to as his study, his cogitorium, and his hole. Pen in hand, he is midway through a sentence in the third chapter of his monograph on Kierkegaard’s pseudonyms when it occurs to him that the book he needs to quote from in order to finish the sentence is downstairs in the living room, where he left it before going up to bed last night. On the way downstairs to retrieve the book, it also occurs to him that he promised to call his sister this morning at ten o’clock, and since it is almost ten now, he decides that he will go into the kitchen and make the call before retrieving the book from the living room. When he walks into the kitchen, however, he is stopped in his tracks by a sharp, stinging smell. Something is burning, he realizes, and as he advances toward the stove, he sees that one of the front burners has been left on and that a low, persistent flame is eating its way into the bottom of the small aluminum pot he used three hours ago to cook his breakfast of two soft-boiled eggs. He turns off the burner, and then, without thinking twice, that is, without bothering to fetch a pot holder or a towel, he lifts the destroyed, smoldering egg boiler off the stove and scalds his hand. Baumgartner cries out in pain. A fraction of a second later, he drops the pot, which hits the floor with an abrupt, clattering ping, and then, still yelping in pain, he rushes over to the sink, turns on the cold water, sticks his right hand under the spout, and holds it there for the next three or four minutes as the chilly stream pours down over his skin. Hoping he has warded off any potential blisters on his fingers and palm, Baumgartner cautiously dries off his hand with a dish towel, pauses for a moment to flex his fingers, pats his hand with the towel a couple of more times, and then asks himself what he is doing in the kitchen. Before he can remember that he is supposed to be calling his sister, the telephone rings. He lifts the receiver off the hook and mumbles forth a guarded hello. His sister, he says to himself, finally remembering why he is here, and now that it is past ten and he has failed to call her, he fully expects Naomi to be the person on the other end of the line, his cantankerous younger sister who will no doubt begin the conversation by scolding him for having forgotten to call her again, as he always does, but once the person on the other end begins to speak, it turns out not to be Naomi but a man, an unknown man with an unfamiliar voice who is stammering out some sort of apology to him for being late. Late for what? Baumgartner asks. To read your meter, the man says. I was supposed to be there at nine, remember? No, Baumgartner doesn’t remember, he can’t recall a single moment in the past days or weeks when he thought the meter reader from the electric company was scheduled to be there at nine, and therefore he tells the man not to worry about it, he plans to be home all morning and afternoon, but the electric company man, who sounds young and inexperienced and eager to please, insists on explaining that he has no time to explain just now why he didn’t show up on time, but there was a good reason for it, a reason beyond his control, and that he will be there as soon as he can. Fine, Baumgartner says, I’ll see you then. He hangs up and looks down at his right hand, which has begun to throb from the burn, but when he examines his palm and fingers, he sees no signs of blistering or peeling skin, just a general sort of redness. Not so bad, he thinks, I can live with that, and then, addressing himself in the second person, he thinks, You stupid ass, consider yourself lucky. It occurs to him that he should call Naomi now, on the spot, to head her off at the pass, but just as he lifts the receiver off the hook to dial her number, the doorbell rings. A prolonged sigh emerges from Baumgartner’s lungs. With the dial tone still buzzing in his hand, he hangs up the receiver and begins walking toward the front of the house, grumpily kicking aside the scorched pot as he heads out of the kitchen. His mood brightens when he opens the door and sees that it is the UPS woman, Molly, a frequent visitor who over time has acquired the status of… of what? Not quite a friend, exactly, but more than just an acquaintance by now, given that she has been coming to the door two or three times a week for the past five years, and the truth is that the lonely Baumgartner, whose wife has been dead for close to a decade, has a secret crush on this chunky woman in her mid-thirties whose last name he doesn’t even know, for even if Molly is black and his wife was not, there is something in her eyes that makes him think of his dead Anna whenever he looks at her. It never fails to happen, but precisely what that thing is he is hard-pressed to say. A sense of alertness, perhaps, although it is a good deal more than that, or else something that could be described as a radiant vigilance, or else, if not that, quite simply the power of an illuminated selfhood, human aliveness in all its vibratory splendor emanating from within to without in a complex, interlocking dance of feeling and thought—something like that, perhaps, if such a thing makes any sense, but whatever you want to call the thing that Anna had, Molly has it as well. For that reason, Baumgartner has taken to ordering books he does not need and will never open and will end up donating to the local public library for the sole purpose of spending a minute or two in Molly’s company every time she rings the bell to deliver one of the books. Good morning, Professor, she says, smiling her illuminated smile at him as if it were a benediction. Another book for you. Thank you, Molly, Baumgartner says, smiling back at her as she hands him the slender brown package. How are you doing today? It’s early yet—too soon to tell—but so far the ups are more up than the downs are down. It’s hard to feel blue on a gorgeous morning like this one. The first good day of spring—the best day of the year. Let’s enjoy it while we can, Molly. You never know what’s going to happen next. Ain’t that the truth, Molly replies. She lets out a short, complicitous laugh, and then, before he can think of some clever or amusing response that would prolong the conversation, she is waving goodbye to him and walking back to her truck. That is another one of the many things Baumgartner likes about Molly. She always laughs at his lame remarks, even the most feeble ones, the out-and-out duds. He walks back into the kitchen and deposits the unopened book package on top of the pile of other unopened book packages wedged into a corner of the room near the table. The tower has grown so high of late that it looks as if one or two more of those pale brown rectangles will topple the whole thing over. Baumgartner makes a mental note to remove the books from their cardboard enclosures at some point later in the day and transfer the naked books to the least full of the several cartons sitting on the back porch that have been set aside with other unwanted books for donation to the public library. Yes, yes, Baumgartner says to himself, I know I promised to do that the last time Molly was here, and the time before that as well, but this time I really mean it. He looks at his watch and sees that it is ten-fifteen. Getting late, he thinks, but perhaps not too late to call Naomi and head her off at the pass before she can begin showering him with foulmouthed insults. He reaches for the phone, but just as he is about to lift it off the hook, the little white devil rings again. Again, he assumes it is his sister, and again he is wrong. A small, trembling voice answers his mumbled hello with a barely audible question: Mr. Baumgartner? The words are spoken by someone so young and so clearly in distress that Baumgartner is flooded with alarm, as if every organ in his body were suddenly working at twice its normal speed. When he asks who it is, the voice says Rosita, and all at once he knows that something must have happened to Mrs. Flores, the woman who first came to clean the house a few days after Anna’s funeral and has been coming twice a week since then to mop the floors and vacuum the rugs and tend to his laundry and handle numerous other household chores that have prevented him from living in squalor and disarray for the past nine and a half years, the good and steady and mostly silent, walled-off Mrs. Flores, with her construction-worker husband and three children, the two grown boys and the youngest one, Rosita, a skinny twelve-year-old with magnificent brown eyes who comes to the house every year on Halloween for her little bag of goodies. What’s wrong, Rosita? Baumgartner asks. Has something happened to your mother? No, Rosita says, not my mother. My father. Baumgartner waits for several moments as the girl’s pent-up tears spill out of her in a short, stifled crying fit, and because the little one is struggling to hold herself together and will not allow herself to let go completely, her breath has turned into a series of chopped-off gasps and shudderings. Baumgartner understands that because Mrs. Flores was scheduled to come to the house this afternoon, and because it is spring break and her daughter is not at school, she has instructed Rosita to call Mr.Baumgartner about the emergency while she herself goes off to confront whatever it is that has happened to her husband. Once the gasps and choked-off tears have subsided somewhat, Baumgartner asks the next question. By piecing together the girl’s fragmented account of what her mother told her, who herself had heard it from someone else, he gathers that Mr. Flores was on a kitchen remodeling job this morning, and as he was down in the client’s basement cutting two-by-fours with his buzz saw, an operation he has performed hundreds if not thousands of times in the past, he somehow managed to slice off two of the fingers on his right hand. Baumgartner sees the two severed fingers falling into a pile of sawdust on the floor. He sees the blood flowing from the bare, skinless stumps. He hears Mr. Flores scream. At last he says: Don’t worry, Rosita. I know it sounds terrible, but the doctors can fix it. They can reattach your father’s fingers to the hand, and by the time you start school again in the fall, he’ll be in perfect shape again. Really? Yes, really. I promise. Because the girl is alone in the house, and because she has been locked in a state of pure, petrified panic ever since her mother left for the hospital, Baumgartner goes on talking to her for another ten minutes. At one point toward the end of the conversation, he manages to coax something that resembles a laugh from her, and when they finally hang up, that tiny excuse of a laugh is what stays with him, for he is almost certain it will stand as the single most important thing he has accomplished all day. Nevertheless, Baumgartner is shaken. He pulls out a chair and sits down, fixing his eyes on the black ring of an old coffee-cup stain as he walks through the scene in his mind. Angel Flores, a veteran carpenter of forty-eight, in the act of doing something he has done repeatedly and successfully over the course of many years, suddenly and unaccountably slips up and, through a single moment’s inattention, gravely injures himself. Why? What caused him to lose his concentration and turn his thoughts from the task at hand, which is a simple one if you are concentrating and a dangerous one if you are not? Had one of his co-workers distracted him by walking down the stairs at that moment? Had a stray thought inadvertently entered his head? Had a fly landed on his nose? Had he felt a sudden pain in his stomach? Had he drunk too much last night or quarreled with his wife before leaving the house or… It suddenly occurs to him that perhaps Mr. Flores was cutting off his fingers at the precise moment that he, Baumgartner, was burning his hand on the pot. Each one the cause of his own misery, even if one’s misery was far greater than the other’s, and yet, in each case— The doorbell rings, interrupting the flow of Baumgartner’s wandering thoughts. Damn it, he says, as he slowly rises from the chair and shuffles toward the front of the house, They won’t even let a man think around here. When Baumgartner opens the front door, he finds himself looking into the face of the meter reader, a tall, strapping fellow in his late twenties or early thirties dressed in the electric company’s regulation blue shirt, with a PSE&G logo emblazoned on the left pocket and, just under it, in vivid yellow stitching, the name of the man inside the shirt: Ed. As far as Baumgartner can tell, the look in Ed’s eyes is both hopeful and distraught. A strange combination, he thinks, and when Ed offers a tentative smile by way of greeting, the effect is even more confusing—as if the meter reader is half expecting the door to be slammed in his face. To allay the man’s anxieties, Baumgartner invites him into the house. Thank you, Mr. Boom Garden, the man says, as he strides across the threshold. I appreciate it. Sigh? says Ed. What kind of a name is that? Not the sigh you make with your breath—just Sy, s–y. It’s short for Seymour, the ridiculous name my parents gave me when I was born. Sy is no great shakes, I admit, but at least it’s better than Seymour. You, too, huh? says the meter reader. Me, too, what? says Baumgartner. Stuck with a name you don’t like. What’s wrong with Ed? Nothing. It’s the last name that bugs me. Oh? And what is it? Papadopoulos. Nothing wrong with that. It’s a fine Greek name. For someone who lives in Greece, maybe. But it makes people in America laugh. The other kids laughed at me when I was in school, and when I was pitching A-ball a few years back, the whole crowd would laugh when they heard my name announced over the loudspeaker. It gives a guy a what-do-you-call-it. A complex. If it bothers you so much, why don’t you change it? I can’t. It would break my father’s heart. Baumgartner is growing bored. If he doesn’t put a halt to these meandering irrelevancies, Ed Papadopoulos will soon be spouting his father’s entire life story to him or reminiscing about his up-and-down career in the low minor leagues, so Sy, short for Seymour, abruptly changes the topic and asks Ed if he would like to take a look at the meter in the basement. That is when he learns that this is the young man’s first day on the job and that the meter downstairs will be the first one he has ever read as a full-fledged employee of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, which explains why he did not show up at the appointed time—not through any fault of his own, mind you, but because a gang of veteran meter readers on the staff played a joke on him this morning—his first morning on the job!—and emptied the gas tank in his van, leaving him with enough fuel to travel only half a mile, which caused the van to stall out on a crowded road in heavy rush hour traffic and led to the embarrassing delay. He is sorry, he says, so terribly sorry for inconveniencing him. If only he’d had the good sense to check the gas gauge before going off on his rounds, he would have been here on time, but those stupid pranksters had to play their joke on him, just because he’s the new kid on the block, and watch and see if he doesn’t catch hell from the supervisor for it. Another one of these screwups, and he’ll be put on probation. Two more, and he’ll probably be canned. By now, Baumgartner is ready to scream. From whence came this brawny motormouth, he asks himself, and by what means can this inexhaustible flow of words be stopped? And yet, in spite of his growing irritation, he can’t help feeling some sympathy for this good-natured oaf, so rather than open his lungs and let forth with a full-throated howl, Baumgartner emits a soft, almost inaudible sigh and begins walking toward the door that leads to the basement. It’s down there, he says, on the back wall to the left, but when he flicks the switch to turn on the basement light, the basement remains dark. Damn it, Baumgartner says, struggling not to lose control of himself, in the same way little Rosita had struggled not to cry when they talked earlier, the bulb down there must have burned out. No problem, says Ed. I have a flashlight. Standard equipment, you know. Good. I’m sure you’ll be able to find it. Maybe yes, maybe no, says the novice meter reader. You wouldn’t mind going down to show me where it is, would you? Just this once, so I won’t waste any more of your time. It occurs to Baumgartner that Ed Papadopoulos is afraid of the dark, or perhaps just afraid of dark basements, especially in old houses like this one, with spiderwebs dangling from the beams and giant bugs scampering along the floor and God knows what invisible objects blocking passage to the meter, and therefore, even though he has no doubt that Naomi will call him the instant his foot touches the bottom step, Baumgartner reluctantly allows himself to be talked into leading the way. The stairs to the basement are wobbly and decrepit, one more thing that Baumgartner has promised himself to repair and still hasn’t, not even after years of making the same promise with the same sense of earnest resolve, for it never occurs to him to think about the stairs until he finds himself walking down to the basement, and once he goes up again and shuts the door, he forgets all about them. Now, with no overhead light to illuminate the stairs, and with the only source of light coming from Ed’s flashlight behind him, Baumgartner warily takes hold of the splintered wooden railing, but no sooner does he tighten his grip around it than his scorched palm and fingers are jabbed by a thousand phantom needles—as if he were being burned again. He instantly draws back the hand, and because there is no railing on the left, he has nothing to hold on to anymore, but still, confident that he knows these stairs well after living in this house for so many years, he hazards a first step downward, misses the plank by half an inch, loses his balance in the dark, and tumbles down to the bottom, bashing an elbow, bashing the other elbow, and then cracking his right knee against the hard cement floor. For the second time that morning, Baumgartner cries out in pain. The cry dissipates into a prolonged spasm of groans as his crumpled-up body twists around on the dank floor. He has no idea that his limbs are moving, but he nevertheless knows that he is still conscious, for a number of disconnected thoughts are bouncing around in his head, even if those thoughts are dim and incomprehensible to him, which would disqualify them as true thoughts, he supposes, and relegate them to the category of almost-thoughts or non-thoughts, except perhaps that in spite of the pain assaulting his elbows and right knee, there is no pain in his head, which would suggest that his skull has survived the fall without any serious knocks, which in turn would suggest that when all is said and done the accident will not have turned him into a blithering, drooling idiot ripe for the glue factory. A moment later, however, when Ed is standing over him and shining the flashlight in his face, Baumgartner is unable to summon the words to tell him to turn the light elsewhere and instead lets out another groan as he puts his right hand over his eyes. This inability to articulate his thoughts troubles him, even frightens him. If nothing else, it proves that the brainworks are still scrambled, if not permanently damaged after all, or else merely gummed up for the time being by the pain that has gone on digging into various body parts other than his head, his right elbow in particular, which felt as if it would burst into flames when he lifted his arm to cover his eyes with his hand, the same right hand that has already been burned this morning and is still aching now, no doubt because he broke the final stage of his fall by thrusting out his hands as he hit the cement floor at the bottom, even though he has no memory of doing that. Holy shit, Ed says. Are you all right? After a long pause, Baumgartner at last manages to push some words out of his mouth. Hard to say, he says. Gratifying as it is to learn that he has not lost the power of speech, the pain is still too strong for him to exult in the victory. At least I’m not dead, he continues. There’s something to be said for that, I suppose. Of course there is, replies the meter man, there’s everything to be said for it. But tell me, Sy, where does it hurt? As Baumgartner enumerates the banged-up places on his body, Ed, slipping into the role of professional sports trainer, carefully assesses the potential damage to each battered muscle, tendon, and bone, and once the inventory is complete, he asks Baumgartner if he has the strength to be lifted off the ground and guided up the stairs. Let’s give it a shot, Baumgartner says. If I can’t make it, we’ll know soon enough. So Ed Papadopoulos, a stranger who entered Baumgartner’s house no more than fifteen minutes ago, hoists the old man from the ground with his right hand as he holds the flashlight with his left, and then, with his right arm firmly clamped around Baumgartner’s ribs and torso, begins the laborious process of maneuvering him up the narrow, rickety stairs. Of all the things that hurt, Baumgartner discovers, it is the knee that hurts the most, hurts so much that merely to stand on it produces a yowling sort of pain, such yowls as to mimic the discord and clamor of forty screeching bobcats, and yet, spurred on by his gratitude for Ed’s solicitous care and capable, muscular arm, Baumgartner is determined to do his best and not complain, to bear up to the yowls and shrieks in steadfast, stoical silence. Therefore, even when Ed launches into an account of his own knee injury four years ago, a torn meniscus that put him on the shelf for most of the season and ultimately destroyed his pitching career, Baumgartner emits no sound but for an occasional grunt, nor does he speak or cry out when Ed goes on to explain that once he returned from his injury his heater had lost its bite and his curve had lost its snap, and there it was, he says, So long Charlie, it’s been nice to know ya, and even then, as Baumgartner remains trapped within the ex-pitcher’s long-winded tale of broken dreams and cups of coffee that were never drunk, which lasts throughout the entire four minutes it takes to ascend the stairs, he does not hold it against Ed and in fact clings to the meter reader’s words as a grim but welcome distraction from the pain. Once they make it to the top of the stairs, Baumgartner continues to lean on Ed as he hobbles forward into the living room, where his protector eases him onto the sofa and then props up his head with a pair of embroidered pillows. We should put some ice on that knee, the young man says, and before Baumgartner can tell him that the ice machine in the refrigerator is broken, Ed disappears from the room. Baumgartner listens as the freezer compartment is opened and then closed. A few seconds later, Ed reappears, looking both befuddled and chagrined. No ice, he says, speaking in the same forlorn tone as a child who has just discovered there is no Santa Claus or an adolescent searcher who has just discovered there is no God or a dying man who has just discovered there is no tomorrow. Don’t worry about it, Baumgartner says, I’ll be fine. I don’t know about that, the meter man says. You look pretty banged up, Sy. Hair all disheveled, your pants all smudgy and stained. We should probably get you to the hospital for some X-rays. Just to make sure that nothing’s broken. Forget it, Baumgartner says. No hospital, no X-rays. All I need is a little rest, a chance to regroup. I’ll be up and about in no time. Well, suit yourself, Ed says, looking over his patient carefully as small, invisible wheels begin to turn in his head. At least let me get you a glass of water, okay? Thank you. A glass of water would be lovely. A minute and a half later, as Baumgartner is drinking the water, Ed abruptly sits down on the floor and leans forward until his face is almost touching Baumgartner’s. Tell me, Sy, he asks, what year is it? Baumgartner pauses in mid-sip, gulps down the water gathered in his mouth, and says: What kind of a question is that? Just humor me, Sy. What year is it? Well, let’s see. If we can eliminate 1906 and 1687, along with 1777 and 1944, then it must be 2018. How’s that? Close enough? Ed smiles and says: Right down the middle of the plate. Satisfied? Two or three more—just for the fun of it. Sighing deeply with exasperation, Baumgartner ponders whether to pop Ed in the snout or to play along out of politeness. He shuts his eyes, poised at the crossroads between crotchety old grump and otherworldly sage, and finally says, All right, doctor. Next question. Where are we? Where? Why, we’re here, of course,where we always are—each one of us locked in his or her here from the moment we’re born until the day we die. True enough, but I’m thinking more along the lines of what town we’re in. The place on the map that the two of us are in right now. Well, in that case, we’re in Princeton, aren’t we? Princeton, New Jersey, to be exact. A beautiful but dreary place in my opinion, but that’s only my opinion. What do you think? I don’t know. I’ve never been here before. It looks pretty nice to me, but I don’t live here the way you do, so I can’t really say. Baumgartner wants to go on teasing Ed as they march through the remaining questions, but he can’t bring himself to do it. The force of the young man’s goodwill overwhelms any impulse to mock him, and so once the little Q&A is finished and the meter man is satisfied that his patient has no concussion or other life-threatening symptoms, Baumgartner tells him that he has already taken up enough of his time and that he should be off on his rounds again, lickety-split, since there are more meters to be read today, which suddenly reminds Ed that in all the confusion following Baumgartner’s tumble down the stairs, he has forgotten to read the meter, and just like that he grabs hold of his flashlight and hustles out of the room to complete his first job as an official member of the PSE&G staff. As Baumgartner listens to the sound of boots clomping down the basement stairs, he reflects on the curious skein of circumstances that has put him on his back with a pair of throbbing elbows and a swollen, aching knee, which no doubt will cause him to walk with a limp for the next several weeks, if not to the end of the summer or perhaps even to the end of his life. Nothing to be done about that, he says to himself, and then his thoughts turn to poor Mr. Flores and that dreadful business of the two chopped-off fingers. How horrible it must have been to see himself doing that to his own body, Baumgartner thinks, not just watching his fingers fall off his hand but knowing that he himself was responsible for his own mutilation. From all he has heard, doctors can routinely sew back severed fingers these days and get them working normally again, but he doesn’t know anyone who has personally experienced one of those miraculous restorations and therefore hopes he was not lying to Rosita when he promised that her father would eventually be whole again, for one must never lie to children, never, not under any circumstances, even if that rule can sometimes be broken when it comes to adults. By now he has forgotten all about his Kierkegaard essay and the book he was planning to carry upstairs in order to polish off the sentence he was writing. He has also forgotten about the phone call to his sister and the fact that he ever had a sister to begin with, for so much has happened since those things were important, pressing matters to him that they might as well have been part of someone else’s life. For the time being, his only plans are to go on resting for a while and wait for Ed to return from his meter work below, at which point he will thank him for his many kindnesses and send him on his way. He closes his eyes, and for the next minute or two his thoughts continueto drift from this thing to that thing, but before long there are no things and the thoughts have been replaced by a succession of dream images, most of them of Anna when Anna was young, and one by one he sees her smiling at him and frowning at him and spinning across a room somewhere and sitting in a chair somewhere and standing on her toes and stretching her arms toward the ceiling. When he wakes up, the light trickling into the room suggests that some time has passed. Baumgartner assumes it has been no more than twelve or fifteen minutes, but when he looks at his watch, the dial says ten to one, which means that he has been out cold for forty-five minutes or an hour. He glances over at the coffee table immediately to his right and sees that a handwritten note is spread out on top of a pile of books. If he wants to read it, he will have to extend his right arm in order to snag the sheet with his fingertips, which will further call upon him to test the condition of his elbow, but what the hell, he thinks, be a brave boy and do it, and so Baumgartner does it, and while the elbow is sore and painful, the pain is not so terrible as to require anything more than a loud grunt. Dear Sy, You were asleep when I got upstairs. I didn’t want to disturb you so I left. When I’m done working I’ll go to the store and get you a bag of ice. It will help your knee and cut down the swelling. I’ll also get a new lightbulb for your basement. Expect me between 6 and 6:30. Sincerely yours, Ed Papadopoulos. Extraordinary, Baumgartner says to himself. A perfect stranger going out of his way to do all that. In a world full of shitheads and selfish brutes, along comes this good-hearted lunkhead as an angel of mercy, and yes, the ice will surely help, since the knee is exceedingly tender and the flesh around the patella is bloated now, spongy with blood and damaged tissue or whatever it is that gathers under the skin when a part of the body begins to swell. Baumgartner makes a mental note to call Ed’s supervisor at PSE&G and gush enthusiastically about the outstanding qualities of the new man on his team. The only telephone on the ground floor is in the kitchen, and when Baumgartner thinks about going to the kitchen, he understands that he is hungry, so hungry that he decides that when and if he can manage to walk that far, he will not only make the call to PSE&G but rustle up some lunch for himself as well. Rolling off the sofa is less difficult than he imagines it will be, but standing up proves to be a torture, as does the act of moving his right leg forward, especially when he plants his right foot on the floor. Grunting helps a bit, but not much, and while hopping across the room on his left leg would be the ideal solution, he is afraid he would lose his balance and fall, even though he was once considered a fine athlete, one of the best in his school when he was young, but that was a long time ago now, a whole lifetime ago when you stop and think about how many years have gone by since then, and Baumgartner understands how foolish it would be even to consider taking that risk, in spite of the fact that he was once capable of taking hold of his left foot with his right hand and jumping over his left leg with his right leg without letting go of the left foot with the right hand. It was a feat that inspired awe among his friends and made the girls gasp, for he was the only person who could pull off that bizarre, mindless stunt, but that was then and this is now, he says to himself, and for now he has no choice but to hobble and grunt his way to the kitchen with slow, cautious steps and pray he doesn’t collapse before he gets there. He nearly collapses but doesn’t, he nearly doesn’t make it but does, and once he crosses the finish line he is so drained by his exertions that he plops himself down in one of the chairs spread around the kitchen table. Needless to say, it is the one closest to the door he has just walked through, but it is also the only one from which a person can look out through the window and see the entire backyard and, by turning his head slightly in another direction, see the entire room as well. Breathing hard and hammered by what he has just been through, Baumgartner knows it will be a long while before he can stand up again and make the journey from the chair to the cupboard and then to the fridge and the stove and the sink and the wall phone, and for now he just sits there in a blur of pain and exhaustion, indifferent as to where he is looking or what he is seeing or even if he is seeing anything at all. As it happens, he has landed in the chair in such a way that his head is turned in the direction of the room, and as his breathing gradually subsides to a more or less normal rhythm, he begins to cast his eyes around the room and eventually catches sight of the scorched pot on the floor. That was the start of it, he says to himself, the first mishap of the day, which led to all the others on this day of endless mishaps, but as he continues to look at the blackened aluminum pot on the other side of the room, his thoughts slowly drift away from the dumb-show pratfalls of this morning to the past, the far past flickering at the outer edge of memory, and bit by lilliputian bit it all comes back to him, the lost world of Then, and there he is in his barely finished twenty-one-year-old body, a piss-poor, first-year graduate student on the upper Upper West Side of Manhattan marching out into the light of a late September afternoon in search of some things for the first solo apartment he has ever lived in, off to the Goodwill store on Amsterdam Avenue to buy a cupboard’s worth of cheap, secondhand cooking utensils for his microscopic kitchenette, and that blank but cluttered place with the yellowed walls and dim fluorescent lights was where he caught his first glimpse of Anna, the girl with the brilliant, all-seeing eyes, no more than twenty years old herself and a student in the neighborhood as well. Not one word exchanged between them, no more than a couple of glances in each other’s direction, sizing each other up, testing out the potential pros and cons of what might or might not begin to happen if something began to happen, a little smile from her, a little smile from him, but that was all, and off she went into the September afternoon as Mr. Timid stood there like the dolt he was and still is and wound up buying this crummy aluminum pot, which cost all of ten cents and stayed with him all these years until it was finally extinguished this morning. Eight months went by until he finally ran into her again, but of course he remembered her, and for reasons that are still unfathomable to him, she remembered him as well, and then it started, little by little it started until they were married five years later and his true life began, his one and only life that lasted until she ran into the Cape Cod surf nine summers ago and encountered the fierce, monster wave that broke her back and killed her, and since that afternoon, since that afternoon—no, Baumgartner says to himself, you mustn’t go there now, you sorry bag of shit, suck it up and turn your eyes away from the pot, fuckhead, or I’ll strangle you to death with my own two hands. So Baumgartner turns his eyes from the pot on the floor and looks out into the backyard, which is little more than a patch of poorly tended grass and a single dogwood tree, not yet in bloom but beginning to sprout some buds, and lo and behold, look at that, he says to himself, a robin has landed on the grass, no doubt to scope out the territory and hunt for worms, and there, look, he’s found one, he’s pulling it out with his beak, and then, thwack, he throws it onto the grass and bobs around for a few seconds to look at other things, and then, suddenly, he pounces on the worm again and shakes it around with his beak, snips off a small bite of it and then, thwack, he throws it onto the ground again, bounces around a little more and then dips his head one last time, snags the worm, and swallows it in a single gulp. Baumgartner keeps his eyes fixed on the robin as it goes about its business of catching and devouring worms, for there are many of those little creatures embedded under the surface of the backyard, far more than he ever imagined there were, and by and by, as the robin goes on pulling them out of the ground, Baumgartner begins to wonder what worms taste like and how it would feel to put a writhing, living worm in your mouth and swallow it.

        "story": "Actually, I had walked into the hallway and disappeared into the bedroom briefly. Several of them danced and I heard Vida say about me, “He disappeared into the backyard.” She, Vida—once went everywhere with me, in the air, on foot, by car and train, and still I can’t now really claim her as a true friend. So, Vida was once my hope that everything in my life that was bad or sad would end. Today I had set out deluxe vegetables—the spinach ring that Les loves, alongside a big cheese-egg float. And I enjoy washing the greens clear of their colonies of organisms, scanning the wrinkles and the cracks for their impurities over and over again. Ted prodded the dessert, said he was tired, and griped about my squash that was too spicy. “I’ll tell you what let’s do,” I said. Then Polly arrived angry. “Are there two Gulfs by any chance? You said to go five blocks beyond the station!” I forgot about Ted. I was glad of Alice’s presence. I adore Alice and I hooked my hand around her elbow. I guess I expect too much goodwill, especially from Alice, deference and enamoredness. There it is!—what I want from Alice, who had just found a framed photograph of my father. “I liked him, but he didn’t like me,” I said. “Do I look like him around the eyes? I don’t have the pointed chin.” But Alice cold-shouldered my father in order to put a cheese cone on her plate and then other people followed her around and I know she causes sexual excitement. Oh, eat, drink, and explore. I love those ideas. My thought was—if I left the house now, I could return to my party at six. I did. I took a walk around the block—got a cheap cocktail—where I could also get a quick bite in a shushed atmosphere. But what if I could have gone anywhere? I would go to Japan probably. I’d like to go into one of those Japanese temples or estates to get a feeling of the emptiness of the rooms. Why emptiness? I am saying empty—why do I say empty?—because of how I grew up inside of clutter. Very often a room is a rectangular space—corners and juts. When getting into a room like that with all that clutter—the shape of the room just falls away. So I wonder if I’d feel any better in an empty room—if the shape of the room had a strong presence... yet it was cordial. i fixed my hair My tactic last night to secure my husband’s fellow feeling might have been a touch too simplistic. But it should be enough, no more required before sleep. I inclined toward Howard and—done!—I kissed him on the mouth! And in the morning, I pinned a beautiful and well-made cloth flower clip over one ear to cheer myself up, because in my dream I had neglected a dying child while it felt like eons were passing. If I really face facts, though, I find most of my solace in the spirit of my hair. It is in a half-up, fishtail braid these days. Then after my shift at the mill—where I am running around like a sacred rabbit usually. Typo! Sorry. Scared rabbit usually!—I became much less dynamic. I told my husband to—“wrap it up!”—once supper was over, and flexed my fingers with a flourish in the direction of the dirtied tableware, to make of my command a little joke. For some odd reason I went into the yard and tripped badly on a stepping-stone. I fell into the privet hedge and had to shove at the hedge to boost myself up and away from it. But I am not frail. Even when I was a girl I did physical work beyond my strength. Inside the house, our son, Reggie, had the most peachy expression of appreciation and innocence on his face, because something of that tradition survives here. Except that Howard said, “I found a box of kitchen matches in the trash. You could have burned the whole house down.” In our bedroom, on the soft mattress, I was drowsy, yet newly aware that some foreign material was ground into my abraded skin, so I got up and gently washed my arm. Did not disturb the dressing for twenty-four hours, maintained cold treatment for my bruise. And for my family? Easy does it, so that it won’t blow up in my face. I make suggestions—I’ll need more of these—I will discuss questions, bake my cookies in batches—all while I am so certain about so many things. for example, the son What are they going to do now, folks? The most necessary step? The father had a grip on the boy’s wrist near the lilac bush, which the mother sat beside, and the mother said, “There isn’t time for that, you know, now. I have to go get my tooth implant.” The boy sprang loose from his father and then up an incline and the father ran after and held on, as the child plunged about. Don’t spit on your mother! Never spit on her. You have to say you are sorry to your mother! The boy strongly has a sense he should be elsewhere, whereas the mother likes to believe she is a practical young woman and she is by all appearances placid. The father attempts to be mighty in battle. And that boy, Derek Hood, is now a man. Born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, he still lives there. Hood is both distinguished and cruel and has exerted himself to relieve poverty and sickness. One stormy evening his young son says, “It’s raining!” The boy’s mother says, “No, it’s not.” “But,” the boy insists, “I hear the di di di di di di di di!” “I don’t hear it either,” his father says. He never found anyone as difficult to hit as that little boy. fling This is snug enough and the warm day allows for sitting outside, and she holds a flower stalk, a featherbell, and has tried forever not to be an ass, tried. What about him? He’s got a slip of paper in his hand while birds go by demonstrating all manner of flying styles—long, strong, provoking strokes, or agitated. “That goose is in pain, too!” the old woman says. “It must hurt it to fly like that and it sounds as if it’s sick. It’s hoarse!” The old man’s limbs don’t hurt that much. Hers hurt. Her left foot, both knees. It’s the heel of her left foot. Her left hand is at issue, naturally, under these circumstances, yes, and typically. And it is not to her advantage that she often sleeps with her hands held up above her head, positioned as if for the Highland Fling. The panicle on her lap—it’s finished—has flattened. And the elderly man and woman will yield to a superior force, too—but in a good way?—sometime soon. For now, they budge a bit—and the woman thinks, I am going to go inside and set the oven at four hundred and fifty and start the carrots. The sparrow near the bent toe of her shoe takes off toward a tree as she rises from her lawn chair, and she wonders aloud, “How does he know I can’t chase up there after him?” And the old man? He has had a wise idea, too—which for him provides an intermission of sorts, and so... But as it happens he is napping when a small boy approaches and causes the woman to feel childish fear. “What did you say?” she asks the child. “I want to show you something!” the little boy keeps saying. “I want to show you show you something!” and the boy is supposed to turn up in the nick of time and be much more intelligible, but this old woman just can’t make him out. In the meantime, we can look around at where they all are, where centuries ago, executions and floggings took place. But this is also where this mister and the missus once stood and danced together—walk, walk, walk, and step hold—and there are the starry, late blooming flowers, and the shadblow and a birch, and a shrubbery garden border. The little boy has unknown ambitions and has just departed and the old woman cranks her head sideways, skyward. And she doesn’t wonder to what or to whom she says?—Bring down a big owl or let me see a hawk down here so I can scare the hell out of him too! And this is almost the whole story I wanted to tell you—how an old wife left the shore—but she doesn’t die yet, a minute or so after midday, just after saying, “I’ll go in now...” She lingers—although she hardly lingers at all. She is interested to see if she will make a spectacle of herself, or if she can possibly be very smart about it, or better yet—dainty. one woman and five men She has said, “I don’t make friends easily with men. I don’t really like the trouble of them. I like the idea of men.” And yet, she has developed two effective modes of operating: survey the other’s body, then stealthily approach, or lie still at first. And her life has been one crowded calendar. But look what we have here—nobody in a bed and instead a ramble in progress, as Mr.Rollo Ryder conducts the woman on a moderate climb. And at the zenith—they both felt weaker, as if they had received a rough physical blow. No!—not on account of their light physical exertions. What caused the offense? It was the severe sight, as they looked out from the promontory, of rock formations with minimal vegetation. And the wallop, of course, was nothing personal, was well meant and all that. And this incident has unreasonably increased the woman’s dislike for Mr.Ryder, even though once, in his company, she did feel thoroughly and delightfully stretched. But from where they stood that day, apparently, the bright light revealed pockmarks in the rock, the face of which was bony, freckled, pallid. But supposing nothing more happens and that this is how the story sullenly ends. So unfair—because just to the north lies a mountain range where—as it is told in another tale about this woman—she gets to keep company with a mountain god in the form of a dog—who possesses patience, intelligence, and gentleness.

        "story": "Long after his fiancée had fallen asleep in bed, Adam Edwards read next to her on his phone. He thumbed the screen to scroll through a long article. The words glowed and passed. At the end, he removed his thumb. “Wow,” he thought to himself. He lay in the quiet night, in his soft bed, having just read the long, stimulating, very stimulating, article. A car cruised by on the street outside at slow speed. Shifting his focus away from the article, across the phone’s top edge, he settled his gaze onto the shadowy ceiling. The eye movement and the angle of his neck loosened his thoughts. “Wow, wow, wow,” he thought. He scrolled upward on his phone to look at the title of the article: “Maoism.” The Wikipedia page on Maoism contained phrases he had never heard before, words he had not once been exposed to in his thirty-five years of American life. A question of tone had led Adam to the Maoism Wikipedia page. The tone of a line in a review of a video game, a game that Adam thought he might want to play someday. The author had mentioned Maoism, and the mention, in passing, sounded snarky to Adam’s ear, but without knowing anything about Maoism, he couldn’t really know how snarky, or whether it was, in fact, snarky at all. “I’ve heard of Maoism, of course, but I can’t say what it is,” Adam admitted to himself, wondering about the Maoism, and the snark. The mention in the video game review went like this: “You can even play as Maoists and buck history racking up buttloads of extra grain.” What should he make of this? Adam needed to know, even though it was late at night, and his fiancée, Samantha, was asleep next to him in bed. It took forty minutes to read the entire Wikipedia page. And once he had, his previous ignorance of Maoism seemed impossible, since, as the article explained, and Adam accepted into his heart, Maoism was one of the most important political happenings in all of the twentieth century, the century into which Adam had been born. “Why hadn’t anyone told me?” he wondered fretfully. In his mind’s eye, as if flipping through a slideshow, Adam tried to think of all the people he had known in his thirty-five years of life in America, none of whom had explained Maoism to him. His immediate family appeared first. They stood against the back of the house, its vinyl siding the color of raw chicken, hands on each others’ shoulders: Dad in his dress shirt for work; Mom in her favorite yellow blouse, most often worn to summer family gatherings; his sister much younger, for some reason, from a different era than the other two, a teenager in her volleyball uniform. They looked happy, genuinely happy, and already, looking at them in his mind’s eye, Adam wasn’t so surprised that these people had never talked about Maoism. He pictured other people he had known, teachers and uncles and classmates, but soon he stopped. It would’ve been far too difficult for Adam to cycle through everyone he had ever known, even under such relaxed yet stimulating circumstances. Born in a large town, he had graduated from a large college in another large town, and now he was employed in a third large town at an important and growing institution; he had known literally thousands of people in his life so far. The three towns—the birth town, the college town, and the growing-institution town—formed a triangle with an area of nearly 490 square miles. But for Adam, the small sample he had seen in his mental slideshow offered a clue: maybe no one in this whole group, this sea of thousands, even if many of them had heard of Maoism, knew enough about Maoism to talk about it. How could any of them have approached Adam, said “Maoism,” and then continued from that word? “I could tell them about Maoism.” Adam’s eyes had adjusted to the dark. Now parts of the room looked merely dusklike. He could become a teacher of Maoism, or, at least, a Maoism explainer. Suddenly, it seemed oddly necessary to know everything about Maoism, and the need to know seized him fervently. He began the Wikipedia article again, from the top: Maoism, or Mao Zedong Thought (Chinese: 东思想; pinyin: Máo Zédōng sīxiǎng), is a variety of Marxism–Leninism that Mao Zedong developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the Republic of China and later the People’s Republic of China. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism–Leninism is that the peasantry are the revolutionary vanguard in pre-industrial societies rather than the proletariat. “Vanguard.” An icy shiver passed through Adam: thirty-five years old, learning about vanguards for the first time. Under the sheets he moved his feet and clicked his ankles in an attempt to fidget away from the discomfort of his ignorance. “Proletariat. I know what that means,” he thought. “Or maybe I only kind of know what it means. Poor people.” He thought about members of his mother’s extended family, who were poor and possibly proletariat. Daybreak Blue, by Matthew Wong Restlessness surged through him. He wanted to jump out of bed, but that would have woken Samantha. Samantha found his enthusiasm infectious, but something told him: not this time. She, like he, had to work in the morning. It was hard enough to wake refreshed when you hated your job, without late-night discussions of Maoism. It all depended on the principal. This school, the one Samantha was currently working with, had a bad one. When entering into a school and demonstrating that standardized test preparation can be done in such a way as to allay apprehension, minimize self-doubt, and foster mindfulness, things can go very well or very poorly. A school’s culture emanates from the principal. Schools are strangely local in that sense, even those in large cities or under the umbrella of much larger entities, and Samantha would go as far as to say, when she really got going on the subject, which was often, that it didn’t even matter for how long the principal had been there. From day one under a new principal that school was different. There’s something obliterating about the personality and acumen of a new principal, Samantha said, no matter the specifics of the personality or the acumen. It would have been wrong to wake Samantha and make her peer into the night’s darkness. She was a light sleeper. When he jumped out of bed, she would hear the thump of his heels on the floor, put her glasses on her face, and see her fiancé’s dim outline standing at the bedside. She would do all of this just to hear him say, “Oh, sorry. I’m just getting really excited about Maoism, which I know nothing about. You?” But he had to get out of bed! Carefully, he slid his feet from under the covers until the bare air touched them. Soon he was standing upright, and he took the water glass from his bedside table. In his other hand his phone glowed against his white Hanes boxer briefs and V-necked T-shirt. He eyed the closed bedroom door a few paces away. He liked closing the door to the bedroom before they went to bed. It finalized the night. Slowly, Adam moved toward the doorknob. He reached for it and twisted his wrist with dramatic deliberation to keep the latch from clicking. The hallway outside was much darker than the bedroom. He closed the door behind him with a thin creak. No sound from the other side. He grinned. “Maoism, Maoism.” He tried to erase his smile. The narrow hallway led to the living room. He made out the shapes of the couch, the television, and the bookshelves, which were crowded with DVDs, books, video games, board games, and collectible toys. He walked to the kitchen and, without turning on a light, filled his glass with water. The time on his phone read 12:46 am. In less than seven hours, he would walk back into the kitchen to start his morning. Adam was the assistant director of systems operations for a local museum. It was a museum dedicated to preserving the history of the early settlers of northern Illinois. Thirty buildings, restored to their nineteenth- and early twentieth-century conditions, many moved by heavy construction equipment from the surrounding area so that they could be experienced all together, as a city of sorts, in Naperville, a suburb of Chicago. He had always loved solving technological problems. Colleagues often sent him their problems via email. Now, at the sink, he checked his email. Several messages described work that he would complete when he arrived at the office at 8:30am that morning. For instance, the museum had implemented some recent cloud initiatives, and now the vice president of external affairs could not access the cloud for pictures from a fundraiser. “Need these. Can you look up my password?” Yes, Adam could look up his password. None of the problems described in his email reminded him of the problems he had imagined when he first tried to learn about computers, as a teenager. The 1990s: the internet was heating up; computer games were exploding in complexity. Adam’s father had to learn about computers, too, for his work. “Using them more and more,” he would say. “Everything’s getting computerized now—it’s interesting!” As he looked over Adam’s shoulder while Adam played a game on the computer, which was located in the corner of the living room: “Very interesting what these new computers can do.” Then he’d leave and turn on the TV in the family room. One day, the older man checked out a book on C++ from the library and gave it to his son. “I can’t make heads or tails of this,” he said casually as Adam finished lunch, a bowl of Frosted Flakes, at the table. “Can you?” Adam humored his dad and opened the book in front of him. Chapter 1: Introduction to Computing. After an introductory paragraph, which Adam did not read, he saw: Algorithm 1.1 The Babylonian Algorithm for Computing the Square Root of 2 This is the algorithm that the ancient Babylonians used to compute the square root of two (√2): 1. Set y = 1.0. 2. Replace y with the average of y and 2/y. 3. Repeat Step 2 until its effect upon y is insignificant. 4. Return y. He didn’t want to admit his confusion to his father. Instead, he sneered, “Why did you get me this?” His father looked hurt. He hadn’t steeled himself for such a reaction. “I just thought, you know, something new to figure out.” He zipped up his windbreaker and disappeared outside. Maybe to mow the lawn? But all afternoon the algorithm flitted across Adam’s mind. As he played outdoors, and as he played indoors. He had never seen the word “algorithm” before, so he remembered it as a blank spot next to the word “Babylonian.” Outdoors and indoors, he thought, “Babylonian ______.” As he played H-O-R-S-E with Drew: “Babylonian ______.” As he played Civilization II: “Babylonian _______.” So later, when he went into his room, and he saw the C++ book on his desk (his father must have put it there), Adam picked it up again. He wanted to see the bewildering word. Seeing “algorithm” again, and locking its tightly compressed four syllables into his mind, he also saw, free from the gaze of his father, that beneath the algorithm those four steps which had so surprised him with their utter alienness were actually quite understandable using his knowledge of variables from algebra class. What had loitered diffusely in his mind all afternoon was now a sharp and satisfying set of steps. His pride swelled, and an unusual feeling of certainty mingled with the pride. “Someday I will master this,” he thought, looking at the book. “Just a normal kid, mastering the Babylonian Algorithm and C++. That’s who I am.” In the kitchen of his and Samantha’s apartment, Adam refilled his glass of water. Small emerald reflections swirled through the glass’s curve from the light of his phone. He didn’t really know anything about politics. It was, to use the word again, bewildering. He knew who the president was. And he knew why people were protesting. He had even thought about protesting, but he always had other plans. Or Samantha had plans, and he was part of them. Plus: there was no difference between 4,000 and 4,001 people at a protest. That was a mathematical fact he could never get around. Sure, someone might say, “But that 4,001st person, they might do X,” X being some galvanizing thing. But galvanizing others at a protest didn’t seem like the kind of thing Adam could do. “I don’t know enough about politics to do X,” Adam would say. The person who encouraged him to be the 4,001st person would have to agree. Adam hurriedly read more about Maoism, which is to say that he skimmed the Wikipedia article again. Under the headline “Differences from Marxism” he read: Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao’s words, “A clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it”.[23] “A blank slate. That’s what I am,” Adam thought to himself. He left the water glass on the dark bottom of the sink and ambled to the living room. He turned on a lamp and paced slowly in front of the bookshelves. Adam liked to walk when he had to think about a problem. This was considered unusual for a man who worked with computers. He was expected, he thought, to like sitting in front of a computer. And he did like it. Sometimes, though, when there was a complicated problem to solve, midway through the solving process, not always when he was stuck, but sometimes when he was, he would tell his boss, the director of systems operations, that he was going to take a short walk. He’d simply pop into her office next door and tell her so, adding, “But I’ll have my phone on me.” His boss hadn’t indicated that he was doing anything unusual by taking walks during the workday. But she didn’t tend to indicate things like that. He once saw her eat half a sandwich and then say “I think the ham went bad” without changing her expression. She just threw the rest of the sandwich away. Fireplace, by Matthew Wong A picture in the Wikipedia article, of Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon shaking hands, appeared in Adam’s mind. Both men seemed pleased, but a lot had happened since then. A lot that Adam knew nothing about! Each time Adam paced toward the window, the image of Maoism assembling inside his head projected onto the glass. “Differences from Marxism,” he thought, onto the window. The wood floor creaked in different places each time he crossed the room, and Adam was always glad when his pacing brought him, for a few steps, onto the rug. (“What if I had a pacing rug? The length and size of my pacing?” he thought.) He stopped and looked at the bookshelf. “Nothing on here about Maoism.” Suddenly, the bookshelf disgusted him. He looked at his Star Wars toys. Obscure Star Wars characters. Obscure aliens, obscure humans. What a full, varied universe. And some of the common Star Wars characters, too, like Chewbacca, the Wookiee, standing there, saying, “Hi, Adam.” “I love these characters, and yet, right now, I hate them,” Adam thought. He pictured little Maoist toys instead. What did these Maoist toys look like? Chinese men and women wearing red and gray. Adam’s life seemed more interesting, larger, with these Maoist toys on his bookshelf. The Maoist toys, sitting on his shelf, even next to the same books, DVDs, video games, and board games, signaled a seriousness that Adam was fast realizing he did not possess. Yes, the Maoist toys deepened his life. They were mysterious, figures of a different time, a time to which Adam was not expected to have a relationship, but here he was, celebrating this time and its seriousness in toy form. The Shaanxi province, with its prefecture-level city of Yan’an, as it were, materialized behind the rows of figurines. He pictured it as best he could, and Yan’an looked like a desert city of intrigue and grandeur, one he would like to visit and explore, but from behind Yan’an, the face of Chewbacca kept penetrating. Soon Adam couldn’t see Yan’an at all. The Maoist toys disappeared, too. Only the Star Wars toys remained. He paced again. And every time he tried to think about Maoism, really think about it, he hit a dead end. He didn’t know enough about Chinese history, twentieth-century history, or political categories to be able to think as deeply as he desired to think. Every time he retreated from thinking about Chinese history because he didn’t know enough, he ran straight into the wall of twentieth-century history, about which he was similarly mystified. Without being able to see any of the three overarching topics clearly, Chinese history, twentieth-century history, and political categories, he kept coming back to one question: “What would it mean to believe in Maoism?” It was then that, thumbing through the article, he accidentally thumbed past the last section on “Mao-Spontex,” beyond the seventy-five footnotes, and saw “Further reading” for the first time. He felt as if someone had flung him a life preserver. Of course: he could read a book about all of this. “They have whole books on Maoism,” he chided himself. Calmly, he scanned the list. Eighteen bullet points delineated fourteen books and four scholarly articles. Which book was the correct choice for a beginner such as himself, someone who needed basic concepts defined, but who also desired mastery, total comprehension? He eliminated the four articles. They all compared Maoism with something else, and he wasn’t there yet. Serenely, he saw another way to winnow: many of the books focused on areas adjacent to the core principles of Maoism and said so right in their titles (Maoism at the Grassroots: Everyday Life in China’s Era of High Socialism, for instance). Eventually, he would need to know about these adjacent concepts, but first he needed to study the basics. He was now down to three titles. “I’ll buy all three,” he thought. He sat down on the couch and reached toward the coffee table for his laptop. He opened it and searched for each book on Amazon. Mao’s China and After looked like everything he could ever want, plus it was available on Prime. He added it to his cart. The Political Thought of Mao Tse-Tung was unavailable except at exorbitant prices, or secondhand, which would mean no free shipping. Adam balked. He did not add the book to his cart. Mao Tse-Tung, The Marxist Lord of Misrule: On Practice and Contradiction promised something fun, like a treat, but copy-and-pasting that title into the search bar brought back differing editions of the graphic novel adaptation of the Percy Jackson book series and an array of strange Lord of the Rings products, like a decorative towel. Adam sighed. “I guess it wasn’t meant to be.” So that left Mao’s China and After and nothing else. Perhaps it was better to start with one book anyway. He chose to have it shipped to his office. It would arrive by Friday afternoon. The menu bar running across the top of the screen said 1:58 am. He opened the Maoism Wikipedia page again on his computer. The bigger screen revealed previously unseen aspects of the article. Here was something he had missed: In the late 1970s, the Peruvian communist party Shining Path developed and synthesized Maoism into Marxism–Leninism–Maoism, a contemporary variety of Marxism–Leninism that is a supposed higher level of Marxism–Leninism that can be applied universally.[7] He could see himself reciting the above paragraph, onstage, as if the words were his own, and he felt the electricity of the words as he soberly whispered to himself: “Shining Path ...” “A supposed higher level ...” Adam wanted to be attached to ideas that required saying such words with a straight face to others who also took them seriously. He had a history of doing this. He had been part of a rock band in college, and he had been raised Roman Catholic. It was a pleasure to talk to your bandmates and to fellow Roman Catholics in this serious way, and to be taken seriously. He wasn’t in a rock band now, and he didn’t attend church, so when he did tell new friends that he had been in the Fiery Trial, or that he had been confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church, he had to do so with a bit of irony. Because he didn’t believe in either of those things anymore. It was as simple as that. He had lost his faith, and the Fiery Trial never attracted much enthusiasm, even in their bustling college town, where they once opened for O.A.R., whose bassist, Benj Gershman, said that he thought they had been “locked in.” Adam had been part of so many things in his life, and he was part of many now. He and Samantha rented this apartment together, for instance, with no one else. He was not Roman Catholic because he had lost his faith one day at the age of sixteen. This was not uncommon. There had been no one in the church who could talk to him about the questions he was having about right and wrong. These questions involved sex, mostly, and horrible wishes. He couldn’t go to Father Ernie: Father Ernie didn’t look like a priest. He looked like a bit player in a workplace sitcom. There was no way to trust Father Ernie with knowledge of his horrible wishes. “What about a documentary?” Adam thought to himself as he sat in the living room. He went to YouTube and searched “maoism documentary.” In the results he saw thumbnail after thumbnail of Mao’s face, actual and animated. “To think,” Adam thought, “I’ve seen his face so many times before, not quite knowing who he was, but now I recognize Mao Zedong easily.” The first result differed from the rest. It did not contain Mao’s face. “China: A Century of Revolution 1946–1976” featured an image of a Chinese man with a young child clutching his shoulders from behind. The camera zoomed in on their faces in the short, looping preview that played when Adam hovered his cursor over the thumbnail. The video had been uploaded by someone named Richard Hogan. It was movie-length. Adam clicked. The opening sequence suggested that this was a serious full-length documentary that had run on American TV near the end of the last century. Words appeared in gold: “The Mao Years.” “Perfect,” Adam thought. Soon enough, people who had lived through the Mao years in China talked about their experiences. Over old newsreel footage, Adam heard a narrator, the sort of serious man one expects to hear in a documentary of this kind: “They wanted to transform the lives of one quarter of mankind.” Okay, but what was Maoism? No one explained. Everyone spoke too slowly, too elliptically. The pauses between people talking seemed to go on for minutes, with B-roll footage of crowds and construction and music filling the silences. Adam tried to relax as a Chinese woman explained that because of Mao, women could marry the men they loved. And as he sat back, the image of himself onstage reciting the Maoism Wikipedia page as if he himself had written it, because he knew all there was to know about Maoism, appeared in his mind’s eye again. “Shining Path ...” The image was pleasing, and imaginable, but then his thoughts focused on the crowd. Who was in the crowd? Those interested in Maoism? Maoists? Was, in this vision, Maoism experiencing an onrush of popularity, and so experts, ones like Adam, were being tapped to give high-profile public lectures on the nuts and bolts of this important yet undercovered political theory? Yes, Adam decided, people were interested in Maoism again. And he was in the right place at the right time. And so he walked onstage. “Shining Path ...” Adam paced again in his living room, leaving the documentary to explain the Korean War in the background. Adam didn’t even know that China had anything to do with the Korean War. Yet nearly one million Chinese soldiers had been killed or injured! And Adam’s grandfather had been there, too. Well, not in Korea, but in the Pacific. He had never said anything about Maoism, either. And now he was dead, dead from working too hard building aboveground swimming pools. Adam’s eyes did not return to the screen. He checked his phone, to study the Wikipedia article again. Hours passed in the semi-lit living room. The prospect of knowing about Maoism seemed within reach. China became closer, as did the twentieth century. Political categories sorted themselves. History: weaving. Change: profound. Turmoil: expected. By 4 am, Adam had mulled over much more of the Wikipedia article. His digestion process looked something like this: marveling at the existence of a new area of information, such as a whole section labeled “Contradiction,” and then, after some light daydreaming, picturing himself showing off knowledge of that section in real life. For instance: the next night, like every Wednesday night, Adam and Samantha would gather in downtown Naperville with two other couples for bar trivia. The group chats idly, amiably, between rounds, drinking draft beer under blue light. Ben, Samantha’s friend from work, who is too tall for the stools, returns from delivering the team’s scorecard to the bar trivia emcee, and as Ben approaches the table he complains that he’s sure some of the answers he has just delivered are wrong. Some in the group turn their heads. “Well, I don’t really know they are wrong,” Ben concedes. He just has a feeling. Twice in the previous round, the music round, the table was unable to agree on a definitive answer, and twice the table arrived at a wary, vague consensus. Both times, Adam chose that moment to intervene with a new answer, one that nobody even mentioned in the previous throwing-out of possibilities. Adam then convinced the table to side with his new answer against the original vague consensus. He spoke passionately, enthusiastically, and the others became convinced. (At least, convinced enough.) But now Ben regrets Adam’s “coercions.” Adam forced the rest of the group into tying themselves to “long shot” answers. “They’re long shots!” Ben says, staring down Adam. Ben bangs his fist on the table, which wobbles. Others lurch for their drinks, to keep them from spilling. And Adam merely smiles as beer slips over the rim of his glass. Everyone wonders how he will respond. With all eyes on him, and Ben huffing and fuming, Adam lifts the glass, takes a slow sip, places the glass down, and says, “Coerced? Well, political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” That this scene did not make much sense indicated that Adam was finding it hard to come up with any situation from his everyday life in which he could realistically demonstrate his expertise in Maoism. For starters, the idea of Ben banging his fist on the table was all wrong. As Samantha often noted, disdainfully, Ben was a pushover. Plus, Adam and Ben got along great. And yet, the scene pleased Adam. Here he was, in a situation that had the texture of a situation in which he might find himself, talking to the people he knew best, saying the words of Mao Zedong. What better proof could there be that he was an expert? His laptop died before the documentary finished. He heard the rumble of a distant motor outside. “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” he said, aloud, in the hush of the living room, loud enough for the Star Wars toys, but not Samantha, to hear. “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” he said again, as if coaxing the words out of hiding. Adam had stayed up late reading the internet before, but not like this, not with such elation. He didn’t get out of bed when reading about Soylent, Alan Turing, or serial killers. Why this then? Why tonight? Samantha and Adam were scheduled to marry the following Saturday, February 8. Their family members and friends would attend. Many, many family members and friends. Neither Samantha nor Adam had intended it that way, but that’s how it had turned out. Planning had gotten away from them. Luckily, marrying in the Chicagoland area in winter meant a discount on the venue. Other vendors had also given them a discount. So some things hadn’t gotten away from them. But then, for example, in October, an important relative of Samantha’s declared that he couldn’t attend the wedding on February 8. His potential absence caused a lot of hand-wringing, and Samantha spent hours on the phone with her mother, uncle, aunt, and the wedding planner trying to figure out a way to make it work. Once, over her shoulder, as she dialed Aunt Maggie for the third time that day, Adam said, jokingly, “Let’s just have another wedding for Uncle Albert.” Samantha laughed. About a week later, after much cajoling and family discussion, Uncle Albert found a way to attend on the eighth. It seemed pretty easy for him to do so in the end—he never gave a convincing reason for why he couldn’t attend on the eighth in the first place—but the Uncle Albert incident got Adam thinking: Why not get married many times? The problem with the wedding, it seemed to him, was that it would happen just once. If he and Samantha married several times, the multiplicity of events would relieve the stress of planning a single, momentous occasion. He didn’t mention this idea to Samantha. To tell her, he would need reasons that sounded convincing. All he had was a feeling. And then, one workday morning in early December, while walking from his car to the office, an unadorned nineteenth-century building, visible in the middle distance under a bright-gray sky, he hit upon the way the logistics of several weddings could work: a road trip, driving from location to location, marrying at each stop in front of a few attendees. The bride and groom would travel to the guests, instead of the guests traveling to them. A marriage tour! He could see it now: the tour would transform the act of marrying. Instead of all the time, money, thought, and energy concentrated onto one single event, an event that loomed so large that Adam and Samantha, as bride and groom, were merely bodies sucked into orbit around it, he and she could plan many smaller, charmingly low-stakes events that cohered into an exciting road trip through the Midwest. See part of the country, see the people they loved, have a lot of fun, and get married many times! They would need to postpone the wedding until late spring for better driving conditions, of course. Adam saw Samantha’s face in front of him, and he felt tenderness. He had resigned to the fuss of the wedding, the fuss that would obscure the romance of the single event. The single wedding was to be held in a large Roman Catholic church in Samantha’s hometown. They had driven there twice, and Adam had taken in a lot of the details of this formal, ornate church while also wondering what it meant, as a lapsed Roman Catholic, to omit the lapse so that he could marry in the priest’s church, the same church he had never trusted with his horrible wishes. Adam had met with the priest, Father Jerry, twice, and Adam had talked on the phone with Father Jerry that same number of times. Father Jerry was an older man, but an older man in his prime. He looked and sounded like an excellent golfer. He was priestlike. He understood exactly how to talk to Adam and Samantha about Roman Catholicism, and becoming married Roman Catholics, without forcing either of them to outright lie about the level of their commitment to the Roman Catholic Church. Which was nil. Father Jerry must have understood it was nil. He wasn’t an idiot. He was in his prime. So it didn’t worry Adam too much, or Samantha either, for that matter. But what if this lie, this group self-deception, entered into Adam’s mind during the ceremony? The single wedding event would force him to look in the eyes of his two fellow deceivers quite often. What if, during that eye contact, he had a new qualm with this lie? How would he control his face? It wasn’t one of his strong suits. With a shaggy, quirky, delightful road tour of small, intimate ceremonies, Adam need not worry about lying with a horrible look on his face during the wedding. He could live in the moment of marrying Samantha, a moment he knew he wanted to remember. He could look into her eyes, at her dress, he could feel the weather, there would be all sorts of weather, and both of them could say, one-hundred-percent thinking about the words, “I do.” And rather than have one shot, they could have many. Over time they could improve at marrying. They could have practice! In the car, between stops, they’d discuss strategy. Playfully. The tour would include ten stops, as Adam saw it, not counting opening and closing nights in Naperville: Glen Ellyn, Illinois; Beloit, Wisconsin; Rochester, Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Olathe, Kansas; Evansville, Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Lima, Ohio; Merrillville, Indiana; and West Lafayette, Indiana. This was romance. Romance and sentiment. “We would have a story to tell for the rest of our lives,” Adam thought, sitting in the living room. “Hardly anyone else has ever had a wedding like this.” To make sure about that, he had googled his idea and learned that in 2015 a couple had flown all over the world, marrying in as many countries as possible, and posting photos of themselves in each new exotic location on Instagram. His and Samantha’s weddings would be different. He liked to picture the final event back in Naperville. He and Samantha would drive the two and a half hours from West Lafayette to arrive at their Naperville apartment early in the afternoon. Blearily, they shower, eat takeout from Potter’s, and the weariness of the past weeks’ travel sloughs off them. They put on their wedding outfits—one last time! tonight!—and head to the childhood home of Janet, Samantha’s best friend, whose parents have offered their large backyard for the evening. Christmas lights run from tree to tree above the grass, and a PA system sits near a small stage laid on the lawn for dancing. Late at night, after the chummy, loose ceremony—complete with jokes—and a buffet-style dinner, everyone waits near the small stage. They’re waiting for the reunion of the Fiery Trial. One by one, the members take the stage: Josh at his kit first, then Doug to tune his guitar, his head down in total concentration. He hasn’t changed one bit. Breanna and Tuck, now married, so Adam heard on Facebook, joking and laughing as if still in the early stages of dating. They pick up bass guitar and electric guitar (rhythm), respectively. “Testing, testing,” Tuck says into his microphone. Then the man in the tux, Adam, arrives at the keyboard. He plays some thick major chords. “Hello hello,” he says into his microphone. The crowd goes quiet. “We’re the Fiery Trial.” And before the applause can even start, they launch into their opening number, Marvin Gaye’s “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You).” They play it by the book, and yet it’s entirely their own. The crowd moves forward to dance. “It’s too late to ask her about the road trip,” Adam thought, sitting on the couch in the living room. “If I brought it up now, it would only create problems.” The wedding was in ten days. He ran his hands over a stack of the board games that he and Samantha liked to play together. Suffice it to say, none of the games mentioned Maoism. “This will be a very important moment in my life, whether I like it or not.” He walked back into the dark kitchen and opened the fridge door. He pulled out a jar of blue cheese–stuffed olives. “And I do like it. I don’t mean to be so dour,” he said to himself. He opened the jar, dug a fork out of the drawer, and scooped out two olives. “Everyone gets a little antsy before they get married. Tonight it’s my turn.” He ate seven olives. Then he went for the leftover pad thai. He closed the refrigerator. “Becoming an expert in Maoism,” he thought as he ate the cold noodles, “would become a large part of my history, too, just like getting married.” It was the best pad thai in Naperville. “Even if I didn’t tell anyone, it would be a very large part of my history.” Then, one day, he thought, on the day he died, someone would look to write his obituary, for Adam Edwards had been a solid citizen of the city of Naperville for several decades. He was not a pillar of the community, but one of the steps underneath the pillar. If he was picturing a building in Greece correctly, the steps held up the pillars. And when the obituary reporter went looking into Adam’s life, doing the gumshoe reporting that such a reporter does, she would be surprised at what she found. Arriving at the Edwards-Cunningham household, the reporter encounters a family gathered not in mourning but in active silence, the living room a mess of open boxes of books and notebooks. The widow flips through pages in total concentration. The daughter has placed a set of old hard drives on the coffee table, and one is connected to her tablet device. She’s scrolling through images. The son, who had opened the door for the obituary reporter, a humble smile on his face, returns to similar scrolling, bent in concentration. “What a remarkable scene,” the obituary reporter thinks. She makes a small note in her notebook: “Born again?” “Can I have a look?” the obituary reporter asks. “Of course,” Adam’s daughter replies. She hands the obituary reporter a copy of the will. “You might as well start here.” Hours later, still sifting through notebooks and talking to the family and all those who stopped by to pay their respects, many of whom, after receiving the latest news about Adam’s dedication to Maoism (“His what?”), stay to leaf through his papers, too, the obituary reporter dares to admit to herself that this was exactly the sort of affirming work she had hoped to find when she entered the field of journalism. Where else but in this field can one stumble into a home and find that a recently deceased, solid member of the community had been, in actuality, a passionate and virtuosic Maoist? (The obituary reporter already knows a little bit about Maoism, more than enough to recognize that a dedicated Maoist, secret or otherwise, wasn’t something you found in Naperville every day.) Soon the obituary reporter offers condolences again and, invigorated by the afternoon, excuses herself. She wishes she could stay, but there is a deadline to make. The finished obituary reads something like this: Adam Edwards was a committed citizen of Naperville, Illinois, for forty-three years. Beloved son of Arnold and Nancy Edwards, dear brother of Jennifer Edwards, loving husband of Samantha Cunningham Edwards, loving father of Casey and Amanda, loving uncle of Stephen, Alexander, and Patricia, beloved son-in-law to Terry and Eleanor Cunningham. Edwards grew up in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, and attended Purdue University, where he studied computer science. Edwards was a kind, curious man, and he spent his career as an administrator overseeing computer systems in many important Naperville institutions, including the DuPage Children’s Museum, Edward Hospital, and Naper Settlement. Surprisingly, in his last will and testament, Edwards revealed himself to his family to be a “scholar of Maoism” and a “Maoist.” “The questions—and answers—of Mao Zedong have guided me throughout most of my life and, in fact, all of my married life,” he wrote. “It has been a privilege to navigate my life, even in this capitalistic, imperialist country, with the help of the wisdom of Mao Zedong and the variety of Marxism–Leninism that he introduced to the world.” He continued: “I leave for my children my collection of books and data on the subject of Maoism, and also my extensive commentaries. These can be found in a set of boxes in the attic. I especially hope that my writings on the subjects of dialectical materialism, left deviationism, and the tenets of Maoism embraced by Peru’s Shining Path are of great help and concern to you. It would be humbling if my work were to be found, in the famous phrase describing Mao’s legacy, ’70 percent right, 30 percent wrong.’” Those last words are taken from a quote by Deng Xiaoping, a successor to Mao Zedong. Edwards had requested that his work on Maoism be broadcast as widely as possible. “It’s too easy for something to be lost forever,” he said. “I almost never came across Maoism. No one told me about it. But then, one night, I did hear about it, and it changed my life forever.” Edwards’s daughter, Amanda, after learning about her father’s Maoism, said, “I feel like I’m meeting my father all over again. And I’m learning about Maoism.” Edwards’s wife, Samantha, said, “He was always dedicated to his family, his job, and his community, so it’s not that surprising to find that he was so dedicated to Maoism.” The sun had not yet risen when Adam slipped back between the sheets without causing Samantha to stir. Was he tired? He lay on his back and looked up at the shadows. He would find out when he woke up in a couple of hours. “And I wonder if she’ll notice,” he thought. Not just whether he was tired. “I wonder if I’ll seem different tomorrow.” He corrected himself. “Different today.” In the darkness, he quickly fell asleep, though not before he pictured himself at the end of the workweek, when he would stay late at the office waiting for the book on Maoism to arrive. It’s true that the book would likely be delivered earlier in the day, but you never knew. And if all else failed, which was always possible, he would find the book in the office the following Monday. It could wait.

        "story": "In Old Delhi, not far from Chandni Chowk, on roads plied only by cycle rickshaws and men and women on foot, there is a wonderful little set of alleyways that fork off from the already tight little streets. It is here that my sister and I have come on an errand of the sort our parents now pretend to be too old to undertake, but which really it just amuses them to see the young busied with. And we complain, though we are happy enough to get out of the house and into the city. Working our way in from the station, we pass the dusty bookshops whose vitrines are filled with old medical textbooks and adventure novels, and the shops of the lock sellers and key cutters, and not a few drunks asleep atop the gutters, and find ourselves in the alleys of the wedding stationers. There’s one in particular we’ve been recommended, who used to be connected somehow or other to the Nawab’s court when our grandfather was wazir-e-azam at Rampur, but his heavy wooden doors—not metal shutters, as you’d see elsewhere in the city these days—are closed with a slide bolt and a brass lock. There is no sign as to when he might reopen. In fact, though it’s a Tuesday, most of the wedding stationers appear to be closed, per some schedule unknown to us. Before we can begin discussing whether we will bother to make the journey here again, another stationer, a few shops down, calls to us. This man, about fifty or sixty, in a white kurta and skullcap with henna in his beard, is seated on a high bank so that his legs are visible above the counter that faces the street. We walk over and ask if he knows about the closure of his competitors, but he makes a noncommittal gesture. My sister looks at me for permission, and I shrug. “Do you have anything in a heavy cardstock, and that takes proper gilt lettering?” she asks. The man shouts up to the loft into which a ladder disappears, and after a minute’s rummage some invisible hand tosses down bundles of fresh stock and a packet of sample invitations. The samples are gaudy, clearly offprints of invitations from real weddings, and my sister and I are in an unspoken sympathy of offense at the sequins, borders, and loud scripts. But the plain stock is quite good, a lucky find. We sort through ten or twenty choices and ask after prices, then settle on the best one, which happily is among the least expensive, and give the stationer the particulars. My sister hands him our written-out text, but he waves her off and asks that we dictate it to him. “I can’t read anyone else’s writing,” he says, “or at least I can’t be held responsible for it.” Then he asks offhand when we’ll need it. My sister tells him that the wedding is in mid-April, so two weeks from now at the latest. “You must be Muslim,” he says. We are not wholly surprised that he can tell, our salaams were genuine and casual, but why, we ask, does he ask? “The astrologers have told the idol-worshippers”—our co-religionist here gives us a wink—“that April will be unlucky, so things have been dead slow. Only people of the Book are getting hitched in April.” We don’t know why he is speaking under his breath in this area, which looks to be all either Muslims or stray dogs, but we lean in as if being told a secret. I ask, in jest, whether any Jews or Christians are ordering invitations, but he ignores me. “Anyway,” he says. “Please give me the names of the betrothed.” “Mrs. S— Z— to Dr. A— A—,” says my sister. “Slow down,” he says. “I want to make sure I’ve got that right. You said Mrs., yes? Mrs. for sure?” “Yes,” my sister says, “it’s an elder relative of ours. She was married when she was very young, actually before I was born and when my brother would have been a baby, but her husband died in an accident.” “Ah, God forgive us. No children of her own?” asks the stationer. “No, none.” “But she has found a doctor for a husband,” the man says confidently. “And perhaps he has children, grown like you and your brother?” My sister nods. “And they will give each other some comfort in their twilight years.” My sister and I both say nothing. The stationer notes our distraction and asks whether we are worried about a match with so little at stake. “Well,” says my sister. “It’s a troubling situation, really.” “Why should it be so!” shouts the man, and his voice is so rich with concern that my sister tells him all. “For years after our auntie’s first husband died, the family hoped she would remarry. She kept her looks for a good long time. Even today she’s rather beautiful, though I never know how to judge old people. “Anyway, she would still get an offer here and there, even as she moved past a normal age for marriage. And so our family came to hope that her heart might have softened and healed, but at that very time a peculiar delusion fixed in her mind.” My sister is using her chastest Urdu diction, and the stationer interrupts her with a playful “Vah! Vah!” I find myself a little jealous. He says he’s Lucknow born and bred and no Lakhnavi could speak any better. “She had traveled to the Gulf countries some years ago and got it into her head that the son of a particular sheikh was in love with her. She never so much as met this man, but when she got back here she told our family about his great affection for her, though of course she couldn’t provide any evidence of it. Everyone thought she would eventually recover her senses since she was back in her own country. But if the affair was all in her imagination, why should distance disillusion her? “She was sent to her aunt and uncle’s house in Kashmir that autumn, but neither did this do her any good. She claimed the leaves of the chinars that had fallen on the ground outside her window had been disturbed by the footsteps of the sheikh’s son as he watched her, when really it was nothing but the gardener, or the wind. If the milk in the pantry was low, it was because he had drunk it in the nighttime. If the autumn-blooming roses put on a good show, it was because he had fed them egg shells and molasses. If the post was delayed, it was because he was jealously reading the letters for evidence of another suitor. “This bent of mind has remained the case, as far as we know. But she has learned not to speak of it. Ten years ago, she nearly yielded to the family’s pleas to remarry, when a good man, a foreigner—” “Swiss, I think?” I say. “—who had a tea plantation in the east, made a proposal, but around the same time she had the misfortune to make the acquaintance of some charlatan, a supposed swami, who read her sorrows and her hopes too well and told her not to commit to the union, that someone better would be along soon, someone who loved her much more. Of course she was free to make assumptions about who this meant. And now that she has again agreed to go through with a match, we worry that something similar will happen and humiliate this poor doctor sahib, and bring further embarrassment on our family.” The stationer nods his head at this well-told tale. “It sounds,” he says, “like you need to go to the seller of spare hearts.” “Has that anything to do with the spare-parts district?” I ask. “That place we do know.” There you’ll surely find spare parts, for every kind of machine and device, but moreover it is an immense thieves’ market, with goods rarer than you could imagine alongside the newest conveniences lifted by the palletful straight from the docks as they come off the ships in Bombay or Calcutta, hundreds of miles away. Once, a little electric motor was stolen from our compound over in the south of the city, near the Yamuna, and our gardener found it all the way up here the very next day, and haggled to buy it back for a fair price. “I’ve heard of a hearts seller who used to be in Lucknow,” my sister says brightly. “You know so many things I don’t, Little Pear,” I tease. “Mahmudabad, actually,” says the stationer. “Although, yes, when Raja Sahib’s lands were seized some years after independence, many of those merchants settled in Hazratganj, in the very heart of Lucknow, but the person you’re thinking of never shifted.” “Did the Raja’s family get back the old Metropole Hotel in Nainital?” I wonder aloud. “Yes, exactly,” says the stationer. “And half of Hazratganj, besides. The high court, you’ve surely heard, gave them back most of Mahmudabad.” “Lucky buggers,” mutters my sister, in English. “But enough of such feudal gossip,” says the man, though I’d wager it’s himself he’s chastising, as he clearly enjoys it the most among those present. “The hearts seller was nowhere near either of those places—he was in Mahmudabad itself, right in Sundoli.” “We don’t know the city,” I explain. “Near the railway station?” he asks. We shake our heads. “At any rate, right in the center of the town. But that’s not the point. This one, our Delhi hearts seller, is a nephew of the Mahmudabad one, who must now be dead, or long ago retired back to his village. The family’s reputation is generally one of honesty. Well, as honest as one can be in that trade.” He wrinkles his nose a little and holds on to his cap as he leans far forward over the counter to spit betel juice into the gutter. My sister gives me a wide-eyed grimace before he comes back up. “But for what you’re in need of, I don’t think you can go wrong,” he says. We take the directions from him, finish relating the particulars of the invitations, and hand him a certain amount for the deposit. “Be careful though,” he says as we leave. “There are some sweets sellers near where you’re headed who claim to deal in hearts, but whatever they have, what they keep under the counter, is not to be trusted.” “Oh, look who it is,” I say to my sister. “Isn’t that Rashid?” We call out and find that it is indeed who we thought: Rashid the tailor. He greets us with elaborate courtesy. His teeth as always are stained with betel nut. Both men we’ve spoken to today are great lovers of paan. He asks what brings us to such a cluttered and humble place. “We’re looking for the seller of hearts,” I say. “Well, we came here for wedding invitations, but now we’re doing that also,” says my sister. “The heart seller!” the tailor says. “I’ve just seen him myself.” He lifts up what he’s carrying in the crook of his arm. It’s a packet bound in cotton shipping cloth, tied with twine, and sealed with wax, the cloth marked in both Roman and nastaliq scripts: s. ahmed, provisioners\nbehind green mosque (second\ngully, next to abingdon house)\npurani dilli\nno telephone “That’s the place we’re looking for,” I say. “Oh, may I ask why?” “Our auntie’s quite mad,” says my sister, and leaves it at that. “What about you?” His pause makes me wish she hadn’t asked, but then he gives a little nod and says, apologetically, in old-fashioned phrasing that conveys modesty and shame, “You see, I am afflicted by a fondness for men.” I suppose we knew this, but we make vague expressions of commiseration, not reprimanding him for this tendency but also taking care not to congratulate him excessively in his new direction. It is a delicate matter. “May we see the heart?” asks my sister. “Of course,” he says, as if he’d been rude not to offer. “Oh, you don’t have to undo it all on our behalf,” I say, giving my sister a scolding glance. “It’s no trouble, really,” he says. My sister offers her hands as a table as he undoes the packaging, breaking the seals (at which I wince for some reason) and unwinding the twine. Inside several layers of cheap rag padding lies a small bundle of muslin, the heart inside, swaddled tightly like a newborn. He removes the safety pin holding the wrap in place, and then takes me aback by grabbing one end of the muslin and jerking it upward, letting the fabric unspool rapidly and the heart fall into his palm. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised, though, as tailors must generally be a sure-handed lot. He holds his hand out. The heart is small and neat, a handsome little thing. “Must have cost a packet,” I say. “It wasn’t cheap,” he says. “But, all thanks to God, I’ve been getting a lot of work from the French who are posted here. They want all the latest fashions copied from Paris. They give me a photograph,” he sweeps his hand in front of himself dramatically, “and I can see the lines true as if they were plumbed.” He thrusts his hand downward and flicks his fingers open with a conclusive gesture. “Soon we won’t be able to afford you,” I say in jest. “Your family are as my own to me,” he says, a little offended. “I will not cheat you,” then after a moment, “thanks to God.” “He’s only joking,” says my sister. “And if you charge ten times as much, we’ll beggar ourselves for shame.” This is a very poetic sentence, and once more it’s good that my sister, great reader of ghazals and enthusiast of the dastangoi revival, should be the one to deliver it. I would sound like a bureaucrat trying to declaim such a line, my Urdu corrupted and weak as it is from years overseas. This satisfies the tailor. “But it won’t ruin me. Look here,” he says, and holds the heart up for closer scrutiny. “It’s got only one chamber,” says my sister. “That’s where the price comes down,” says the tailor. “I’m not a rich man, I’ve no need of more than one woman.” My sister trades small talk with him about when he’ll have her petticoats ready, since three at the least are needed for the wedding. Then we say our khuda haafiz. Once we’ve taken our leave and walked a little my sister says to me, “For a tailor he dresses very poorly.” It’s not untrue: large clunky sandals that are falling apart, trousers an awkward gray, a shirt of cheap fabric with collar points from a distant past or an unpromising future. “Oh, be nice,” I say. “That’s not what matters.” “I suppose not.” I have a guess why she’s upset. This happens maybe once or twice a year, when she thinks too much about everything that was stolen from our family or lost by foolishness. None of it ever came back. Yet they have always regarded such things with a fatal humor, and made jokes about the circumstances. Like the time our great-grandfather lost half the mango orchards of Kakrauli to the old Nawab’s idiot son in a bet over who could eat the most poached eggs. And who was the idiot then? All the talk of Mahmudabad has reminded her. I in turn remind her that we are modern people, who live beyond our family. That we move forward in the world by work and by virtue. She nods and casts off her dourness, as she always does. But who doesn’t find loss hurtful in some way, even when it is salutary? Besides, she is younger than I am, and romantic. She feels the loss as spiritual rather than worldly. She says she would like to get a quick bite to eat, and I make us wait until we see a clean-looking place that seems popular enough that the food won’t have been sitting around all day. It’s not too crowded inside, so rather than go in with her to look after her modesty, I wait and poke around the intersection, where three stone-paved streets come together. There’s a sewing-machine repair shop, a shop selling woven reed baskets, an antiquarian bookseller, and a few of those curious general stores of Old Delhi that seem at once to sell everything and nothing: toothbrushes but no toothpaste, yellowing composition books and dry ballpoint pens, stale peanut brittle wrapped in disintegrating cellophane, warm mineral water, double-edged razor blades, gritty Indian bar soap and expensive imported shampoo. The exterior display counter of the place my sister has gone inside is full of traditional delicacies, and I try to see whether I can recognize them all. Among the laddus there’s the motichoor and besan and boondi kinds, and two I don’t know, but which I don’t think I ever knew. There are old-fashioned single servings of firni in little terra-cotta pots. There’s sing barfi, cham cham barfi, and what must be pista barfi. They even have the kind of barfi topped with real gold foil rather than silver foil. I realize as if waking from a dream that this is a sweets shop, and there is no queue at the till, and my sister has been inside a long time. I enter and find her talking to a stooped mithaiwala in a lambskin cap who’s showing her a heart resting on a bed of pastry tissue. “We should go,” I tell her. “I just wanted to see,” she says. “I’m not going to buy anything.” “Then let’s not waste this man’s time,” I say, and take her hand. We get turned around a few times and misdirected by locals who are afraid to disappoint us with an ignorance equal to ours. We curse ourselves for not just asking Rashid to take us there. “It’s not like he would have minded,” says my sister. “I know,” I say. “He would probably be over the moon to spend time with you,” she says. “Your tongue’s still sour from earlier,” I say sharply. “And besides, he’s gone off men.” Then we find the heart seller. He’s in an airy little shop with a single empty glass-topped counter and fresh plaster on the walls. The edges of the heavy wooden posts that frame the open shop front are soft from the dozens of layers of paint they have gained over the years. At present they are a bright dusty blue. The man gives us a shallow nod and a smile. “I’ve heard tell of your uncle in Lucknow,” says my sister. “Ah,” he says. “In Mahmudabad,” I correct her. “Are you people from that area as well, then?” “No, not really,” I say. “Our grandfather was chief minister at the court in Rampur.” “What did you say your family name was?” We tell him. “Ah, of course.” He smiles broadly. I get the curious feeling that maybe he’s dealt with some relative of ours before, but if so he says nothing about it. “And how may I help such fine folk?” he asks. My sister tells him our aunt’s story, though with less flourish than she used with the stationer. Perhaps she is trying to give the heart seller something more technical. He nods throughout, and before she’s wrapped up he waves her off, reaches down into the lower part of the cabinet, and places a heart in the empty glassed-in portion on top. The heart is fairly plain, though a little less antique and more ornate than the one Rashid showed us. “Can you tell us about it?” I ask. “This is one of two that I think would work for your situation,” he says. “It belonged to a simple village woman. She lost her daughter in the field one day, and heard the girl had been taken against her will to Sitapur. This was some time ago. The woman traveled for many miles searching for her daughter.” “Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh?” asks my sister. “No, the other one,” says the man. “Surely not the one in Chhattisgarh?” I say. “The very same,” he says. “I would think they’ve nothing to do in Chhattisgarh but steal girls,” my sister says, by which I think she means, Who knows what even goes on in Chhattisgarh. (I hardly do.) “They are a shiftless lot,” says the heart seller, nodding. “Anyway, the woman reached Sitapur after nightfall, and begged to stay with a little community of farmers on the outskirts, explaining her predicament. They said they would help her look for her daughter the next evening, after finishing work, if she would drive the buffalo for them the next day. There was an illness in Sitapur at the time, and they were short of hands. “So the next day, the woman tended the buffalo. But rather than shirk her task and pine for her daughter, she was exemplary in her duties. The farmers were charged with righteous feeling at seeing this woman’s honest work, and sought the help of some local higher-ups and generally made a big fuss and a big search until the woman’s daughter was found, in circumstances that are not precisely clear. Maybe she’d been taken as a whore, or to work as a servant, who can say.” “Sounds like a fine heart,” I say. “It might work and it might not,” the man says. “I think there’s a good chance, but I don’t want to misrepresent anything.” “There was another option?” asks my sister. He removes the heart from the display and returns it to storage. Then he reaches deep inside the cabinet, as if he’s moving several things around and exposing something well packaged. He does not seem a theatrical man, but the amount of time he takes does build our curiosity. When his hand emerges with the heart, we see that the suspense was justified. The heart is extremely fine and clearly very old. Its form is subtle and precise. A masterpiece. “This,” says the heart seller, “belonged to a prince of the West. One way I heard it told, he was even an emperor. Among the Greeks who lived long ago in Turkey, before the Ottomans took over. He was buried under the walls of the city in which his people lived, a protector even in death. Not one of our Hindustani people, but one of Alexander the Great’s people, who were at one time Hindustanis after a fashion. This prince wasn’t some layabout spoiled rich type, but a soldier, who fought for his people as they faced an unavoidable end. When the walls of his city were taken he looked around and, realizing it would not do to live once his city was fallen, threw himself where the battle raged most fiercely.” He looks heavenward. “Ah, for such days.” The heart seller perhaps detects a dubious silence from me. “These things don’t come with the most thorough paperwork,” he says. “But I can tell when things are right.” He taps his head. “When they’re good. This is”—he searches for the word—“an incorruptible heart.” “It’s beautiful,” says my sister, hardly listening to any of this. “We should take that one.” Like an idiot, she’s forgotten the first thing about dealing with shopkeepers, and in the Old City at that. “Even if a tenth of the story’s true,” I say, “I’m quite sure we can’t afford it.” The man rubs his jaw with a thumb. “Just rent it.” And then because we are surely surprised, he adds, “I know your family. Your aunt can get married and keep it a while, and you can bring it back when you’re sure it’s worked. It doesn’t sound like she’ll need it indefinitely.” “She’s far too old for children,” my sister says. He names a price, with a deposit to be kept as surety. It’s still extraordinary. “We might have to sell some things to cover this,” I say, and now I am the one who is muttering and thinking about all that we’ve swindled ourselves of. The day of the nikah, my sister and I are frantic helping to fix everything that has been done wrong by the tradesmen and laborers who have set it all up with the crooked eye and cheerful laziness of the illiterate. The rows of tables are madly out of line and have to be put straight, which, in fairness to those who have laid out the furniture, proves surprisingly difficult. The props for the tomfooleries are nowhere to be found. The dance floor is sinking into the soft lawn even without people on it. And on and on. Some of those whose labor went into the preparations are invited for the feast, at which they stand by politely at the edges and eat their fill of the impossibly rich food. The descendants of the old court cooks from Rampur have been dredged up from some village and brought to prepare the dinner in giant cauldrons, using a kilo of ghee for each guest as their rule of thumb, and cooking for twice as many as were invited. Auntie S— is brought forward by our great-uncle M— and our father, as the closest thing she has to brothers. The doctor looks pleasant enough. They sign the marriage contract. She looks happy. Rashid the tailor, who is responsible for my sister’s new choli and my new achkan, is among the peripheral invitees. He is engaged to a girl from his village, he tells us. His family found her straightaway. She’s finished six years of school and knows how to speak a bit of English. As soon as he finds a little flat and moves out of his bachelor suite, he’ll send for her. Later in the evening, my sister asks me whether I think the heart is truly what the heart seller said it was and I say that, as the stationer told us, the man was probably as honest as can be hoped for, and besides that, he’s really the only game in town. But I think I am telling this to myself more than to her. Three months after the wedding, on a day when the first monsoon rains have cleared the extra dust and people from the streets, my sister and I go back to Old Delhi, and we return the heart. Then, with the deposit money back in hand, we treat ourselves to a big lunch of kebabs, such as we loved when we were children.

        "story": "Grief takes as long as it wants, in various formations, and doesn’t follow rules the way we’d like to think it does. And for God’s sake, it doesn’t pass through stages. Forget stages, I hate that idea, she said to her friend Valery, who had suggested she try attending a bereavement group. They were walking together on a cloudy afternoon, following a path along the river, with the train tracks up the hill to their right and the river, gray and seething in the fall wind, to their left. Valery, who had gone through a number of steps to get sober and had attended such group meetings with ritualistic, almost religious fervor, seemed absurdly small in her devotion to the therapeutic nature of storytelling, of confession. across the threshold In the group there was a man who lost his teenage daughter two years ago, chasing after a Frisbee into the road. It’s a cliché and we warn and warn but that’s how it happened, he said. It was a warm July afternoon and I was out back—this was my old house, the one I sold last year—on the deck doing some work and she and her friends were up front, playing, and I could hear them laughing, not giggling but teenage laughs, hoots, shouts, stuff like that. It was a sound I could’ve listened to forever until that day, and now, of course, I can’t stand it. Hearing teenage kids kills me now, he said, and then there was a crushing silence as the group members leaned forward, faces in hands, waiting the expected few seconds for what they knew was coming, the choke of it, the restrictive collapse into sobs. It didn’t matter that two years had passed for this man because for a split second—with the gurgle of the coffeemaker on the table behind them—those sounds were in the here and now, as he put it when he got his speaking voice back, clearing his throat, his words full of sorrow. His name was Cal and she’d later learn that he lived in Westchester, in Bedford to be exact, in a house in the wooded countryside along a curvy road, with split rail fences and a white gravel drive. Later she’d sit alongside him in the car outside his house on a clear winter night, with the stars bright overhead and snow windblown across the road, and they’d hear in the music on the radio—something by Chopin, one of the nocturnes, the C-sharp minor, sad and quiet yet somehow uplifting and joyous too—a reflection of their mutual conditions. Something in the formal way he held the steering wheel high, lightly, wiggling his fingers, told her that he would turn and kiss her, and then he’d wait a few seconds and drive up to the house, to delay the weight that would come when they crossed the threshold. Perhaps she knew in the car that he’d gallantly let her go ahead of him, pushing the door, opening his palms, and tossing his fingers into the air as if to say “after me,” and then he’d come in with the rush of cold air—there was woodsmoke along with the smell of pinesap—and they’d stand awkwardly for a moment. A sprig of mistletoe would be hanging from a light fixture in the foyer. He’d look up at it and grimace. Ignore that, he’d say, and he did say. the lawyer His daughter’s name was Drew—like Drew Barrymore, he told them—and he had been unable to say it for over a year, through a bitter divorce and the fury of guilt, until finally one afternoon at the country club, sitting with friends watching kids splash one another in the pool, listening to the laughter, he said her name, Drew, and then said it again. The club didn’t want him as a member anymore, not only because he’d been negligent in attending social gatherings, avoided serving on any committees, and refused to golf, but mainly because he’d become a sad sack who had once been a facilitator, a gregarious guy who could talk about anything to anyone in a friendly manner, a person who, as they used to say, got things done and was well liked. Now he was an isolate, quiet and brusque, shrouded in sorrow. He knew it. The members of the club knew it. Yeah, he said, brusque is the word I’d use. I snapped when I felt like snapping. I felt, and I still feel, he said to the group, that the structures around my everyday actions, the small, silly fucking rules that make up everyday decorum for the living, polite inquisitions about how it’s going, small gestures like a handshake or a pat on the back or whatever, simply no longer mattered. So I just did what I wanted to do, and I still do, when I wanted to do it and when I want to do it, and I said what I wanted to say when I wanted to say it, and still do, in honor of Drew, who would’ve fucking liked seeing me become a kind of rebel, a punk, he said. And then, after someone else had a turn to speak, he put his hands out and added that he meant to say that he often felt he should approach the world as his daughter had approached it, from an angry fifteen-year-old’s vantage. Then he sobbed, and the sob passed gently from one to the other and they all admitted—clutching coffee cups, rubbing their faces—that they were totally helpless, even this far along. For a moment there was a communal flash of grace in the silence, just before someone moaned, or sniffed, or coughed—and the cars outside passed with a judgmental shush that made everyone in the group aware that inside those cars, people were passing with the bitter solace and mindlessness of those who do not know, who have not shared this kind of loss, and in doing so, in passing, were casting a judgment on those inside the church basement, in the chairs, and it was manifested in the sound the tires made as they rotated through the slush. group Grief comes unevenly, not only in relation to the way the bereaved suffers, unique to each personality, but also in relation to the time through which the pain moves, so that for some, a year is more than enough time, or at least adequate, to return to a semblance of normalcy, whereas for others a year is a blip, a flick, a blink, not enough. Other factors—and they all admitted this, talked about it—include the precise manner of your loss, the horrific but necessary circumstances examined over and over again. Jodi, who lost her daughter five years ago in a car crash on the Merritt Parkway, talked obsessively about the need for guardrails on that stretch, about the dangerous nature of decorative trees along the roadside, and, mostly, about the television newscast, the way the information (not news, she cried) had been reported (and I watched, she said, I had to see it, I didn’t believe it), the smirk on the announcer’s mouth, a man named Greg Gunwald, a square-jawed sportscaster who sat in for the news that night, she said. A man who saw life as a matter of scores, of yards gained and all of that. I could hear it in the way he said, Four teenagers were killed tonight, stressing the word four and then putting an even heavier stress on the word horrific, the same way he’d stress the word terrific, as in the way he’d say the Yankees had a terrific comeback. sailing Howard lost his son, Andy, in a boating accident, a freak accident, he said again and again, always working in the word freak, making sure it was clear that it had been a bright, sunny day on the river near Croton, that little inlet, and that his son had been a highly proficient sailor. The kid had wild golden hair (he said another time, passing the photo around), and then they had waited for the catch in his throat—two years had passed for him too—but instead his voice grew shrill. He was coming about in high winds, maybe trying a chicken jibe. It was that simple, he said. According to his friend in the boat, he even announced it, sticking with proper protocol. Prepare to come about, he said, and his friends in the boat ducked but he didn’t duck low enough and the boom knocked him out of the boat. (It went unspoken, but each one of them in the circle thought about the currents of the river, the tidal complexity of the salt water coming up from the sea, and they all thought about the yearly accidents, the canoes tipped, or those who decided to take a dip unaware of the dangers.) A full sail. The luff along the edges, the abundance of wind along the reach of the river, the arch and tip of the boat in relation to the air and the water; a boy, one hand on his tiller, the other on the rope, ducking down but not far enough. first date That’s the thing about Howard, Cal said in the car on their first official date, after a movie in Mount Pleasant. It’s not that I begrudge him the fact that he struggles. It’s the way we all just sort of sit there and let him talk about that kid sailing over and over. I guess what I mean to say, Cal continued, his tone taking on an officious air because he was a lawyer and part of his job was to speak this way, to make opening statements. What I mean to say is I think each of us are inclined to see only into our own grief, so we have to work, use up energy, to move away from our own grief into the grief of others—I mean beyond our trigger mechanisms, oh God, sometimes I hate that phrase—and with Howard it just doesn’t seem worth the effort. They were sitting together on the couch in his living room. He stood up, said excuse me, and left her alone for a moment. On the side table next to the couch was a framed photograph of his ex-wife: short, blond, prim, her slim legs in riding breeches, holding a crop, her nose flat, bent slightly to one side in a way that gave her a ragged edge that was all the more attractive, gazing directly at the camera with a joyous aggression, as if daring the future to send her a tragedy. Over her, the sky was richly blue, with the negligent brilliance of another perfect Westchester afternoon. Turning away from the photo, she looked out at the falling snow whirling into the window light. From the kitchen came the clink of ice in glasses, the tap of a bottle against glass, a sound that seemed lonely and isolated until he came out with the drinks, one in each hand, hoisting them gently. He was a tall man, with narrow hips and wide shoulders and premature salt-and-pepper hair cut in layers sweeping away from his high brow. He moved with a tentativeness she appreciated, and when he spoke it was in his voice too, something that—she would much later come to appreciate—went beyond his grief into the natural ease, a part of himself that had been there before his loss.   coping The way she had coped in the early days—she explained to the group on a cold night in December—was to walk around and imagine her son alongside her, and to speak to him about things as if he were in bodily form, still alive, walking through town, past the pizza parlor, turning right at the corner, past Edward Hopper’s house, telling him about how she had been a good dancer back in the Seventies, when she would do the disco steps, the line actions, with the mirror ball slicing light into fragments, the entire dance floor becoming sequined with light, and her imaginary son would laugh and tease her and call her old and she’d lift her chin, feeling her cheeks tight, too thin, and she’d laugh and then someone, across the street or approaching ahead, would give her the odd look that came from seeing someone talking to the empty air, and she’d feel anger, not shame. On occasion she lashed out, saying, What are you looking at, fucker? I lost my son. Other times she’d hold the anger in and feel her face flush and an ache along her lower back, tingling up into her shoulders. It was physical, she told Cal, later. They’d share that together. He’d take her across the yard and into the grove of oaks, a windbreak, the remains of the farm that had been on his land years ago, and he’d put his hands to his sides and look up at the stars and confess that he had done the same thing, not so long ago, in Mount Kisco, walking along and conversing with his son, talking to him about copyright, about the nature of the Constitution, about his hope that he’d go to law school, follow in the family footsteps. group During those soft, sudden moments of quiet, the sadness seemed pure and mutual between the group members. Someone would say something and then there would be a gasp, an intake of breath, and then around it a silence that seemed stricken—and it was, it was—with a physical anguish so strong it broke apart differences, the bitterness that often went with a story that was told, as the others took it and reflected upon it and then tried and failed to keep it away from their own stories. Then, for what seemed to be a fleeting few seconds, with the thumping of the steam pipes, they’d become aware that they were simply a small group of folks gathered on old folding chairs in a church along the road, not far from the river, with the vaulted stone overhead and, above the arches, in the bell tower, the cast-iron bell that was waiting to be rung, the clapper held in position, the rope hanging limp, plunging down through a hole above the entryway, to be pulled by a church elder or usher during the service, the bell ringing outside, muffled and distant, as the rope slipped up through the hole and then, when it was high enough, the elder reaching up to pull it again, smiling at the pleasure of it like a kid in a schoolyard. At other times there’d be a trite, acidic taste to the words that were spoken, and each of them would retreat inward and close in on the fact that their own grief was integrated into the individual stories of those who were now gone. Then someone would become so overwhelmed by bitterness, unable to hold back, the barrier of civility slipping away, that they’d strike out with a harsh comment, beyond the pale, as she had done early on during their second meeting when a woman named Ruth went on and on and on about an app called JDate, about trying to find a man who would understand that she was a mother who would never be a mother again. Without thinking, she had looked at Ruth and said, You’re dating the dead. That’s what you’re doing. skiing We were skiing in Vermont with several friends, renting a place called the Bates Mansion, having a wonderful time, she told the group one night. It was bitter cold and I drove Andrew up there in the evening, after school. The air was crystal clear and there was a full moon and we were watching the road, and when we got there we couldn’t make it up the driveway because of ice, and he got out and said he’d take care of it. He said that. He said, I’ll take care of it, Mom, and he got out of the car and grabbed the rear bumper and began to push, and I was steering the wheel back and forth, spinning the tires, and when I made it up the hill he came running around in front of the car and started dancing with his arms over his head, victorious, and I got out and gave him a hug and we just stood there for a few seconds, our breath puffing clouds, and it was silent and cold and snowing. The two of us on a bitter cold winter night, she said. It was the first time he said something like that to me, and I remember thinking to myself that he would say that to me again and again as I got older, as I needed him in different ways, as he got more and more mature, and with him gone it’s like something that was meant to be, I mean that was really meant to be, isn’t going to be, she said. The group remained quiet, and Cal, next to her, put his hand gently on her hand and lifted it away, touched her once, not in a creepy way, just quickly with reassurance, and around them in the basement was the purest sort of silence, until the great iron pipes of the church’s heating system gave a thud and the radiators under the basement windows—leaking cold from the street—shuddered and hissed. It was the skiing that brought them together, the pure coincidence of a commonality between their two losses, as they’d see it, the miraculous nature of the truth as it related to the stories they told themselves. That’s how it was. Out of the blue, two souls lost in some woods come upon each other and—at a great distance, barely visible, just silhouettes—recognize something familiar, a slight limp in the gait, the shape of a head, and when they get close enough, before they speak, they begin to laugh because they were old college roommates, or had worked in the same office in Chicago years ago. A magical feeling began to appear at the meetings, beyond conspiracy, beyond luck, that foretold some aspect of existence, sealing a bond that had not existed before the chance encounter. After she mentioned skiing in Vermont he waited a few meetings before he mentioned his own experience, and he kept it vague, just said they used to go skiing and then he got choked up and couldn’t speak. (Much later he’d see that in the withholding he had found some hope; he had foreseen the moment when he would share it with her away from the others, passing it like a chalice, sealing the bond that was forming, and he knew it was only an imagined relationship that had formed, glancing over at her, catching a glimpse of her lovely face: narrow and austere with thin, pale lips and a high freckled brow that seemed enhanced by the way her hair, a brown so deep it was almost red, was pulled back, charged with winter static, loose and curling around her ears, which, when he got close to her during coffee time, looked small, delicate, shell-like when she leaned forward to take a cup, exposing to him for the first time, as the collar of her shirt tightened against it, the long, delicate elegance of her neck.) the red hat I can’t tell you, he’d say later. I can’t tell you what I was feeling when I heard you talk about skiing, about your boy pushing the car in the driveway, because we used to take my daughter skiing in Vermont, too, and I remember when I drove them up there, same kind of thing, late at night after a meeting in the city, moon in the sky, and my little girl was asleep in the back—this was when our marriage seemed strong, tight, good—and there was that feeling, I mean I knew I’d remember that moment forever and look back at it. I have the mind of an attorney, I’ll admit that much, and it seemed to me, I mean it seems to me now too, that it was evidence that the world was right, and so when I go back to it now, I mean like you did that night, I was thinking, Carol, when you were speaking, that I feel doubly betrayed—not only by the memory itself, and what it once meant to me, but by the fact that I actually put it in some sort of mental file and told myself at that time that it was an evidentiary moment, a moment that proved something, proved I was a good father in a good life in a good car driving a moonlit wintery road in Vermont—and now I see that it proved nothing, he said. They were at a restaurant called The Red Hat, seated outside on the patio, overlooking the river, thirty miles from his house and it was midsummer, and the candles flickered in a warm breeze off the water, and Manhattan twenty miles downstream a quivering glob of light in the heat past the pearled beads of the bridge, and the subject had risen up out of the small talk, out of the easeful laughter, and it made that moment—she’d think much later—somehow even more profound, something they’d both remember as formative. drives Late in the winter they began to meet outside the church after meetings, taking long drives north along Route 9D, following the road along the river until the Bear Mountain Bridge appeared, brightly lit, with small brick shanties holding the ends of its cables, desolate and empty as they crossed it, circling around the traffic circle to the Bear Mountain Lodge, where a few cars were parked close to the building but the rest of the parking lot, vast, white with salt, stood empty. He’d slow as they passed the lodge and they’d look up at the dark windows and think, both of them, about lovers in bed, resting in postcoital slumber, sleeping deeply after the exhilaration of touch. (Later they’d share this impression, looking back.) They barely spoke during these drives. They weren’t on a date. I don’t feel like going home yet, she’d say on the sidewalk outside the church, and he’d offer her a drive and they’d go. At Bear Mountain he’d drive to the far end of the parking lot, turn the engine off, and they’d sit and listen to music—classical sometimes, or jazz—and then he’d reach over and touch her shoulder and pull her toward him and kiss her, running his hands up into her hair and around her collar, and he’d smell her and she’d smell him, both inside the protective sense that came from the car cooling down, the leather seats under her wool skirt, the bunch of her stockings around her toes, the sense of her breasts inside her bra, her fingers around his thigh, and then they’d push away from each other and sit back, veering instantly into their own grief, feeling a foolish pleasure in the routine, aware of the immensity of their guilt, the rush of it overpowering, but also aware—they’d both later think—that these drives were part of something larger, a process that included the patrol car that appeared each time, the same cop most likely, swinging his flashlight at them, interrupting their solitude, making them feel like a couple of teenage kids. the eros of grief The fuzz of erotic energy was the strange part. He had lost a daughter and she had lost a son, and somehow those two facts began to form a pattern, a logos. What are the odds of two successful people, two divorcés, two relatively attractive people sitting next to each other in a bereavement group in the basement of a church in Westchester, feeling—as they listened and spoke, as the group descended into a unified sensation of pure loss that, in those moments after someone spoke, also felt like grace, like a sensation of free fall, the sudden jolt of a plane in the middle of a transatlantic flight—a sensual awareness of each other as they sat in the hard chairs, shifting haunches, lifting hands to their cheeks, brushing his five o’clock shadow with the bottom of his palm (she saw him do it out of the corner of her eye), or lifting her chest to take a deep breath and, in doing so, allowing him a glimpse? What were the odds of two people, lonely and lost, coming up to each other during a coffee break and gently, without provocation, as a kind of mutual gesture, lifting their cups as if in a toast, both of them about to sip at the same time, facing each other, and in the uplifting of their hands and the tension that had formed, sloshing the hot coffee onto the floor at the same time? He had a stylized ungainliness that reminded her of Jimmy Stewart, with a voice to match, an aw-shucks way of disregarding his own seriousness while making himself seem, somehow, even more serious. His grief was serious but he wasn’t all that serious, he seemed to be saying with his gestures, sipping and leaning back slightly as he spoke. He asked her where she lived and she told him, and he admitted he’d never been to that side of the river, not once in all his years, except a few times when they drove north on the Thruway, and when she asked him where he lived he said not far, in Bedford. geography Each one of them talked about moving out, changing jobs, shifting their footing. He spoke about moving to Aspen, not only to ski, if he could ever get himself to do it again, but just to be in the crisp mountain air near the edge of the atmosphere, closer to the void of space, the open languor of stars, pristine and pure, sunk deep in a darkness that wasn’t darkness at all but a lack of material. In Aspen I might feel something new. Another time he talked about moving back to his hometown in Pennsylvania, where it would at least look okay to remain silent, to avoid too much, too much, too much, he said while the group waited for him to continue. That night the windows were open and it was a warm spring evening, a faint smell of bloom in the air. I could be reticent. Everyone’s reticent out there, so I wouldn’t stand out. Then he talked about the austere farmhouse his father and mother had, like something from the painting of the farmer and his wife and the pitchfork, joined in holy stoic matrimony against the elemental facts of life, pure and clean, not hidden but not up-front. While the others in the group begin to shift uncomfortably, he went on to speak about the way certain brutalities might be faced by not facing them. In another meeting she talked about moving upstate, to a town called Hudson, which was going through a revival, where everyone was creative and trying to find an orderly but fake (she said fake) sense of authenticity. Or better yet, she went on, one of those abandoned upstate towns where she could walk as a stranger and strike up friendly banter from time to time, when she felt like it, a town where the streets had lost their grandeur and would mirror her own sense of loss, where houses sat plump and stately but also rotting and half-gone, and then she went silent while everyone in the group, each one of them, thought about the ideal place where everyone was alive and well. A few nights later, on a drive through the countryside near his house, she said, I feel just the opposite of what I said in the meeting the other night. There simply isn’t a place in the world where I’d feel better. If I see a picket fence I think about the backyard, and if I think about the backyard I think about the way he used to make a run at the pool, one of those plastic wading pools, and how I’d tell him to stop and he’d run anyway, making a sliding drive into the water. If I lived in Hudson—I mean it’s like one long street going down a hill—I’d still see the river and think about him that way. That night he drove along the reservoir and they looked out at the water and he told her that the original town of Katonah, the first one, was somewhere beneath the water out there, and they both had the same thought: perhaps that was the place to go live again, and then one of them said it and the other said she was thinking the same thing, and instead of crying they both laughed and then he was making fun of the idea, saying, Yeah, let’s go live down there. Better yet, we’ll blow up the dam and live in whatever’s left, and then they stopped at a diner, pale-pink neon tubes around a chrome formation, and had predawn pancakes and coffee together, watching the first frills of light around the trees across the road, feeling at that moment secluded and warm in the booth. stopping distance A year later, when they were skiing in Vermont, he told her about his idea for a group called Stopping Distance. Right after the accident, a part of him, the attorney part, wanted to manifest his grief in some active way, to make a formation out of his loss and to transform the world. So I was thinking of starting a group, or a web page, about fast drivers in relation to pedestrians. You could put in a speed and then find out your stopping distance, because at that time I was totally obsessed with the fact that the car that hit her was going too fast, and that if only the kid driving had been going slower he would’ve stopped just before he hit her. I kept thinking, over and over, stopping distance, and for a week or so, I mean when I was totally glazed over in my sadness, not even close to admitting what had happened, it seemed to make total sense, he said. They were on the lift, almost to the top, in the sudden, clear cold of high altitude, and he felt relieved to leave the bar, to feel his skis touch the ice as the chair swung away behind. Just the icy upper reaches—shrouded in low fog—and the steep initial drop of the slope. He split off at the black diamond while she stayed on the blue trail in a parting that seemed to her, in those initial seconds, before she could think, while he was swooping away into the steep drop-off, with the wildly gorgeous vista opening up around them, to be deeply meaningful. By the time she got to the bottom, sweaty and tired, her ankles aching in the tight bindings, his words were gone, until he appeared a few minutes later, whooping and hissing down out of the trees, emerging suddenly, a crystalline dry shush in his bright-blue ski jacket, letting the poles dangle at his sides, heading straight at her at top speed before cutting into a long, wide snowplow stop that sprayed a fantail of snow into the air and, with wonderful precision, swept along beside her with his face wet and pink, and his eyes, when he pulled off his goggles, were startling, glinting gray, as he leaned over for a kiss. That’s what I mean by stopping distance, he said. It was right then, she’d later think, that she had felt a perfect sense of the destiny of their lives: he would go one way, down the harder course, and she would go the slightly easier path, along the side of the mountain and down an old logging road—but in the end he would emerge, come to a slide alongside her, and they’d kiss and feel alive in a way that was regenerative and, she thought, full of grace. On the way to the lodge, holding her skis, she was aware that she was putting everything into a single symbolic basket, making way too much of the fact that on the way down the hill, in the exhilaration of movement, in her concentration on her legwork, she had forgotten to think about anything at all except reaching the bottom without a spill. recourse When you’re living in a certain kind of loss, the only recourse is to look at events as loaded with symbolic portent, as full of signs and indicators pointing a way out of loss, or to the fact that the loss might never go away; it’s that or the sad but pure darkness and depression of no meaning at all. One way or the other, at a sway of extremes so that suddenly, say, in the middle of a dinner party, with the sparkle of light on the silver—polished that afternoon, the grimy gray of the paste drying to white and then rubbed carefully away to reveal the mirrored shine—the flicker of candlelight and the warmth of the faces can at one moment seem joyful and hopeful, and then, a second later, seem utterly trite and absurd, as a guest laughs and lifts his fork to make a point. Later she’d have to sort it out, do her best to see what meant what and how much of her life at that time—the dates with Cal, the dinners, the meetings at the church and her own work at the school, delegating and going through the motions of being principal, examining test scores, meeting with the superintendent, managing the teaching schedules—had been done with intent, looked at with meaning, and how much of it had been lost in the wash of pain, subsumed, cast away. It was important, she’d later feel, to look back and establish patterns, to trace the complex paths that had somehow led to stability, to the grace of a life with pain but also with love. One afternoon, moving around the kitchen, preparing a roast for dinner, listening to the television set in the den where Cal was watching a football game, feeling a settled calm of domesticity, looking out the window at the clouds gathering over the trees, wintry, tinged with a blush of amber around the edges, she felt her sadness as it seemed to fall forever into the placid standstill of the moment and stay there. It was a brief, fleeting sensation. Then there was a jocular shout from the den, football-related, and she glanced back out the window and remembered, years back, watching her son as he played in the yard, swinging a stick around, his body small and isolated as he made jousting gestures in the air, moving gallantly in the purity of his playfulness at that moment, a moment she had known, even then, that day—whenever it was, she couldn’t really recall—she would file away and remember forever, just as she, on occasion, would go back to that moment in the yard and the pool, his skin glistening seal-wet, and countless other moments that now felt catalogued, sorted out, slightly stiff around the edges, like index cards that had been fingered soft in the corners, and when she left the sink and went to the den to sit with Cal, holding his hand, she stayed silent, let him remain in the present moment, hooting and shouting at the plays, leaning forward. On the screen the college players were hugging one another, jumping up and down, patting rear ends, and pointing fingers at the sky. When the replay came, she watched the quarterback fall back, protected, back farther, his arm cocked and the ball resting in his hand until he unleashed the pass, which arched high into the stadium lights and found a pair of outstretched arms. She watched as the receiver ran in slow motion with the ball cradled into the end zone, lifting it to the heavens as if making an offering, and then collapsed onto his knees. He was crossing himself as she turned and went back into the kitchen. days They moved through days joined by the loss, talking about it obsessively, exchanging intimate details. He told her about the afternoon light coming through the trees as he sat in the backyard in a lawn chair that day, listening to the kids playing out front, and then the odd, rubbery, blunt, sudden sound just before—microseconds, really, but in mental replay, long and drawn out—the screech of car tires on the summer-hot pavement. She retold the story about the trip to Vermont, seeing her son in the driveway; not so much narrative details—outside of the group setting at the church she seemed to stay away from anything resembling a story—but small things, the way he liked to tie his shoes in a double knot, patting the top of the shoes before standing up again, and the stench of his lacrosse gear that couldn’t be washed away (he pieced together these fragments into an image of a young kid who had many superstitions when it came to sports, refusing to wash his gear, tying his shoes in particular knots, wrapping his sticks with tape in a certain way, tying up his own nets to his own specifications). He was a star athlete. His name was Ross. He seemed destined for greatness. He was only fifteen, but the details she gave made him seem older and wiser, a kid who had braced himself and matured to adulthood during a horrible divorce, a fatherless kid—she refused to talk at all about her ex-husband—who had to make do. She talked of his broad shoulders and the way he stood straight, with a kind of dignity. Everything she said solidified his view of the boy. the move She moved to his house in Westchester later that year, packing up her stuff, moving around her son’s old room, which she hadn’t touched since the accident, feeling a resolve, like an iron bar, plunged into her gut, sitting in the car one last time, looking across the driveway at the house and then at the river, and felt the relief of geographic relocation, having left at least a few of the physical reminders behind. He would drift out to the yard from time to time. She’d look out and see him there, standing alone, looking upward, not so much a ghost or an apparition but a clear memory, something she knew she was creating, pushing his image out there amid the pines that had been denuded in the last big storm, many of the long branches twisted off. At that point, for some reason, her grief seemed cheap, like a bad plot in a bad movie, one more thing that Providence had invented to make the world seem brittle and thin. These appearances were as real as the trees in the wind, as real as the walls of the house. He ran around with his stick, throwing the ball at the elastic net, catching it with a twist of his wrist and throwing it back, stopping once to tie his shoes, patting them, and then, with his shoulders straight, glancing back at the house as if he knew she was watching, and it seemed he continued like that for an hour while she stood at the sink, looking out, she told Cal one afternoon. He nodded and gave her a knowing look, and between them, without a word being spoken, a vapor, an ectoplasm of assurance seemed to form, because this, too, was another aspect of their bond, that they could share these crazy intimacies, claim they were true, without shame. He received her grief and she received his, in whatever form it took. the story of her mother Her mother, Ella, had lived alone with her own loss for the last twenty years of her life, in a little house in Cleveland, not far from the airport. She had taken the BRT into the city center to work at a clothing store, and then got a job at an airport newsstand a few years later, ringing up candy bars and bottles of water and newspapers and magazines. Ella had lived in Cleveland most of her life, as had her father, also a Hungarian immigrant who had joined the Navy when he was sixteen, forged his documents, and had come back with a tattoo on his arm and an edge that needed drink. What do you want to work there for? she had asked her mother one afternoon, sitting in the little kitchen—warm, outdated, with a big white stove and linoleum floor with a pattern of little flowers worn away in two spots close to the sink. A small window over the sink opened to a view of the back parking lot of a busy tavern, where night and day people seemed to linger and smoke and break bottles and, on occasion, usually at night, fight. When her father built the house, the parking lot had been—her mother liked to point out each time she visited, each time she looked out the back screen door—an open field. After arriving from Hungary, her father had built the house by hand, using a kit that was first delivered by railroad and then by truck, lifting the boards, which were printed with numbers. Everything but the brick and mortar and the plumbing, the fixtures, and the stove, he liked to point out, and her mother liked to repeat the story. (That’s how we salvage the past, locating the small stories and passing them carefully into the future. Always with the same reverent tone, she thought. But the story of my loss isn’t something I want to pass on. The only thing I can pass is the silence.) All that—the memory of that kitchen in Cleveland and those conversations—was in the past, before her mother died and then, a few years later, her son, but she thought of those particular days—the warmth of the kitchen, the exact smell of the floor wax, something called Future, and then she thought about how her mother’s death had, for a while, opened a sense of taking a step forward in the timeline, but then her son died and reconfigured the order, destabilized everything, and in this destabilized state she began to understand her mother in a different way, to see that she, too, had found a way to continue on after her father’s sudden death—a job at the airport, an arena of transition, fixed in place behind the counter while others moved around her, taking pleasure in the smallest of tasks, neatening stacks of newspapers, listening to the conversations of others. I don’t mind being out there at the airport, her mother said. For one thing, it gives me something to do, and I need to keep busy, and the money helps, and best of all I get to talk to people, to see them as they arrive, thirsty, or in need of a sugar boost. Or they buy one kind of magazine when they’re leaving for a flight, and usually buy a newspaper when they arrive. That kind of thing, she said. The sad thing, though, she said another day, is when I go to get something to eat and see an old couple, dressed up to the nines for a trip, bags sitting there, not speaking at all, just not talking, and then I want to shake them and say, Speak now, when you can, because there’s gonna be a day when you’ll wish you’d talked more, or gotten out of your marriage in the first place. There were things you could remember forever about your parents, about those who were gone, she thought, remembering her mother. All she could do was imagine her mother, a prim, tidy, older woman with perfect skin—no sun, not a bit of sun, not even once in her life, she liked to claim—that looked powdery even when it wasn’t powdered, and pale-blue eyes, reaching for a candy bar or a bottle of water, perfectly content, or so she claimed, to be working amid the hubbub. The end of life, whatever you’re doing near the end, is what seems to define you, someone named Jill in the group said one night, speaking in her eastern seaboard, blue-blooded voice, mimicking Katharine Hepburn, annoyingly precise. the natural dead Grief over the natural death of an older person had a different flavor, of course. Everyone knew that, or thought they did. That’s another thing: those who have not had a loss so deep and so tragic can only imagine what it’s like, and when they try to imagine, for a fleeting second or two, they do so with a bit of a freakish, superstitious avoidance maneuver, because to go too close to trying to imagine it might be to jinx something so that it becomes a reality of some kind, if not a material reality, an imagined reality. It just can’t be done. Those in the group who talked of others often spoke judgmentally of those who had not experienced such pain, as a way of getting a firm footing on the outcrop of their loss. They don’t want to think about it. But even when they try, they really don’t, someone in the group once said. Perhaps it was Jill, who wore black wool skirts and wonderful shoes, designer shoes with blood-red soles and stoic black blouses and, on one occasion, a Jackie Kennedy?style veil. Jill’s little boy—from what could be pieced together—had gone through a long fight with cancer, starting at age nine, stretching year after year into his late teens. The anger Jill brought to the group had to be respected and channeled gently away. They listened and nodded, made polite comments about how well she articulated her pain. The men in the group, at least outwardly, in their gestures, seemed better equipped to understand her rage, the desire to lash out at those who just didn’t, and would never, ever, ever, get it. They pounded fists into fists and nodded in agreement and said they could totally understand. I’ve wanted to punch a doctor myself, Cal said, and then he blushed, spreading his palms on his knees, leaning forward and adding, but of course I wouldn’t. I’d get hold of myself. I’d remind myself of the legal consequences, of course, but I’d also tell myself that they have nothing to do with it, and can’t get it, and that I have to understand that fact, I mean really understand it, or it will eat me up. (He mentioned his Stopping Distance project later in that same meeting.) Whereas most of the women resorted to a series of soft touches, to verbal diversion techniques (You shouldn’t even think about how other people might be feeling), and to an agreement, silent and unspoken but visible in their eyes, in their aversion to what the men had said, that at times all you can do is say “now now, now now,” and hug and hold one another as you release yourself into the physicality of grief. the wedding The wedding would take place at a church Cal knew in Garrison, not far from Cold Spring, a small chapel atop a stone outcrop that he had spotted one morning from the train, on the way up to file a claim at the federal bankruptcy court in Poughkeepsie. Seen from the train window, the chapel seemed to float above the river. They would settle into a comfortable arrangement, move away from his house in Westchester, find a place new and apart from both of their old lives where they could settle into their twilight years, arranging life around their mutual loss, which would, by that time, be a powerful but manageable pain in the field of memory. He’d retire from his law firm in the city, manage his stocks on a computer screen as a hobby, and get up for coffee in late afternoon. There would be the years of wearing slippers into the afternoon, of moving around the house in a leisurely manner, of making small decisions as if they were big, paging through the Metropolitan Opera brochure, planning the season, picking La Bohème and Boris Godunov, looking forward to the train ride into Grand Central, the cab over to Lincoln Center. Ahead, they would sense, was the end of the line, a terminus of sorts, so the days would compress, tighten, and there would be a sense of urgency in the way they filled the calendar, a sense of a desire to get as much in while the going was good—she liked to say—of making use of time in a way that was respectful, zeroing in on the abundance of each moment, stopping, from time to time, alone, in the later afternoons, to simply hold each other in the living room, establishing the kind of intense eye contact that occurred between older people, who, after looking back, would make an effort to home in on the present. Then, on some particular afternoon she would feel it between them, the large, abstract silence that was, they both knew, a formation around the unspoken loss, which was not so much a black hole—as she imagined it—as a black speck, whatever was left when enough was forgotten. (Because, as someone said one night in the group, You can’t fully remember pain. Pain comes and goes. Physical pain, most of all, but mental pain, too, otherwise you’d never go on. If you remembered what it was like to give birth, if you could recall that pain with acuteness, you’d never do it again, is what I think, someone had said.) bindings And it did turn out that way, for the most part, although a few years after he had resigned from the firm they moved west to a small house in Pennsylvania, not far from the Delaware Water Gap, up on a ridge overlooking the valley, far away from the Hudson River, which had somehow, they admitted, united them symbolically and proved too much to bear, a reminder in too many ways, couched in two different memories, his and hers, but still flowing through the pain. His father had had a hardware business in Stroudsburg, and he went to the shop in the mornings and helped out, sharpening lawn mower blades (at least that was one thing he mentioned doing), holding the metal against the spinning sharpening stone, blowing the dust off, running his thumb along the edge, imagining all the grass it would cut on summer afternoons. For that was another part of it, finding release in the minutiae of daily life, and both of them had longed to get away from what had been the complexity of the city, to find a new ritual. He screened windows, running the rubber band into the groove with a roller, and moved around the shop while his father—unfashionably stoic, hunched over in chronic pain from his arthritic neck, having survived the Depression on a farm in Bismarck, North Dakota—worked at the register. One afternoon, shortly after his father went into the hospital with congestive heart failure (What’s failing? Nothing’s goddamn failing, his father had said, frustrated), Cal sat in the back of the store, amid the goods, with the pale midafternoon light coming through the front window, down across the old wooden aisles, barely lit, the feeble neon overhead fixtures long burned out, and began to cry for the first time in three years, feeling the waves of anguish arrive, not in response to any precise stimulus or memory, but simply because of the way the light looked and the intense silence of the store, and he recalled, because he groped around, felt a need to find a source for his grief, to pin it to some particular image, his daughter in her ski gear, stiff in the nylon embrace, her face puffy, wet, and red—a baby face, the same face she had as a baby when he lifted her out of the bathtub—as she stood and waited while he adjusted the tension on her bindings, twisting the small screw. Right then, on the ski slope, he thought in the store, he had had a profound insight: to protect his daughter, the tension had to be exactly right, loose enough so that the skis would fly away under force but tight enough to sustain her on her run down the mountain, because she was a shaggy, youthful skier, loose in the joints, free, fearless, dangerously reckless in a spirited way. He would explain all of this to Carol later that night, in bed. I had to find something to make sense of it, he told her. Otherwise it was just another one of those waves that come more and more infrequently. Otherwise I was just this sad old man in the back of a hardware store crying like a fool. So I thought about the way she used to look when she came down to the bottom of the mountain, you know, suddenly appearing. She’d always ski the last run of the day, and she’d always take some back trail, and she’d take as much time as she could, until it was almost dark. And I’d always—and this happened three years in a row—wait for her and worry, worry and wait, and then she’d appear, he explained, and for the first time in three years they wept together, snow falling outside into the valley behind the house, and out there somewhere below, the Delaware River plunged through the ease of the gap. That’s how it worked, he thought. You want nothing more than a straight line away from grief, to disassociate the story from geography, from landscape and the things in the landscape, the shrill morning call of some bird waking before sunrise, startling the early morning dusk, a kid with a skateboard, his feet as if glued, betraying physics as he skips with a jerk up a curbstone. All you want is a semblance of orderly structure in your progression back into the world, while others find it dubious that someone who has lost so much isn’t wallowing in the eternal loss, because the entire house, up on the ridge, overlooking the valley on that clear, cold winter night, seemed to be spinning into a whirlpool for a moment as they held each other in bed. Then, just as suddenly, it was over, and he went and turned on the late show, and they watched the opening monologue. You grant yourself the grace of a story, but then it goes away. People spin stories around your loss. The unimaginable is the most fearsome thing. In some small pocket, some primal recess of their minds, some dark little cave, is a place where the deepest fear rests, some assure themselves to feel better. Put it there, they say to themselves, and then they lean down and tie a shoelace on a little foot, or wipe a mouth, or kiss a forehead, or tuck a blanket under a chin, or remove a Band-Aid with a swift, urgent sweep and then laugh it away. Woe to the one who admits that those dark little places, the boxes—he thought the next afternoon, sorting nails, opening and closing the long, wooden drawers, enjoying the heft and the rattle—do not exist at all, because when you lose something dear it builds a box that you can’t imagine, he thought, and then a customer came in, the bell over the door tinkled, and he went back to moving through reality again, the floor creaking under his shoes, going to the register and saying hello to Marge Pierson, one of his father’s favorites, gaunt but still elegant, her eyes deep blue, a former beauty queen, a woman with her own sorrows, a woman who had lost her husband years back in a horrific car accident and still carried it with her somehow, in the scarf she wore around her neck, in the way she clutched her small purse, in the cut of her skirt over her bony hips. Grief in prepackaged form, he thought, sweeping the back of the shop, thinking about a smart little piece he had seen on the news that morning about a woman who, as a way of overcoming her loss, had formed a fund for children like her daughter. Lilly’s Fund. The music began to swell beneath her voice halfway through, and then emerging onto the screen in soft focus was the face of a child, angelic, of course, with downy, windblown hair and eyes that were wide and blue and, of course, deeply innocent, with freckles around her perfect nose and then, before you could take that image in, they were back in a studio in New York, with the mother who was also somewhat angelic, her face seemingly free of makeup and startlingly assured as she explained that she had set up a fund not as a way to help herself through her loss but as a way to help other kids in the name of her daughter and to assure the world that no one else in the future would have to suffer such a loss. But at that point a shot of her hands appeared, just her hands, folded together in her lap, and he saw in the image of her fingers interlaced that the package she had created meant nothing outside of the context of the production itself, the ads that framed her story, and he thought, and told his wife later that night, that nothing could package grief, not really, not a fund, not anything like his idea, Stopping Distance, nothing at all. He said that and then stopped speaking, another of his non sequiturs arriving out of the blue as they read together in bed, leaning against the headboard side by side, and he said it and she nodded and remained silent, because to say something more—they both knew—would be to open the door to a particular dialogue that, for the most part, was better left unspoken. What was inside that silence was the fact that the previous candor, the words spoken in group years back—not so long, really, but long enough to seem threadbare—had worked magic at that moment in their lives and was now unnecessary. He was speaking, changing the subject, of his old English professor at Princeton, a man named Shilling, who had taught them about James Joyce, about the idea of epiphany. He had us write our own, or at least attempt one, and I wrote mine about my father, something about him in the house—not that far away from this place here, Carol, and then he let his voice trail off as he remembered the old room, the thick plaster walls and the dormer and the small ledge by the window with the cushion where he used to sit, looking out at the rolling hills, and where he probably sat to write his epiphany on a cold winter night like this one. What had he written about? He couldn’t remember, not at all, just that it had some tragic overtone, and it was one of those moments that he thought he would hold forever, just as he thought he’d hold forever the sound of the contact of the car when it hit Drew, the silence that came before it happened and the sudden silence when it was over. But now, he admitted, it was gone. On the bed, he absently reached over and touched her shoulder lightly and let his hand rest there a moment while she read. Then he stood up and went to the window and looked out at a view that was, basically, with only a mile or two difference, the same one he had seen as a kid. The snow was moving through the wan moonlight, fuzzy and haloed, and beyond the trees at the edge of the yard he could see the faint outline of the Blue Mountains. Yes, the candor of those meetings, the frankness and intensity of confession, the sharing of pain from mouth to mouth had formed a basic physics that purged the details away, and the frank, open talk, it now seemed, had been predicated on the fact of forgetfulness couched, most certainly, in a sense of safety that came not only from their shared loss but also a shared sense that most of what they said, like everything else, would vaporize into the future, disappear. All that would remain—and all that does remain—is the structure of the process, the grace of mutual attention shared for a few hours, once a week, in that basement room that smelled of wood polish and floor wax, with the pipes banging and the sense that overhead was a sacred space, empty pews and unlit candles and stained glass windows—vivid by day, with scenes from the Book of Psalms, and a dove in the upper window with an olive branch in its beak—invisible at night aside from faint outlines of scenes fused with the dark outside. Over the years there had been between them a sense of guilt that appeared from time to time, usually when they were alone in the car on rare visits back to New York, over the fact that somehow they had found joy and companionship and had been brought together by mutual loss, he thought at the window. But then he was turning away from the window and standing near the bed, and she looked up from her book, sensing that he had something important to say, and he was about to suggest that they fly to Aspen sometime soon, maybe in a couple of weeks, and ski dry powder. He’d go ahead and test his skills on a black diamond while she, if she wanted, he’d say—and he did say, a few seconds later—could, if she felt like it, take the slower back trails, and then he’d stand at the bottom of the mountain and wait for her to emerge, the sounds of her skis arriving first, that magical hiss, and then she would emerge with joy, and she’d swing around and spray powder in his face, and he’d let it melt on his cheeks until she reached up to brush it away.

        "story": "The day Aaron finished rehab, Cassie picked him up and drove him to New York City. Though they lived in Boston, and the facility was north, in New Hampshire, it seemed obvious to her that Boston was no place to celebrate, if celebrate was the right word. For one, it was Boston, and second, it was the site of Aaron’s most recent bout of trouble. Even if they would be returning soon enough, it seemed to her a kindness to prolong the time away as much as possible. New York, she knew, had its own “triggers”—even if Aaron claimed not to believe in the concept—but it still felt to her like the best place for them to be. It was where they’d met and spent their first happy years together, and besides, there was just so much more to do there. “I think I might need to spend some time at that place again,” he’d said quietly. That was two months ago, as she drove him home from the jail. It would be his second time at “that place” since they’d been together, and his third overall. It made her sad, and weary, but she couldn’t quite summon anger. He was smart and kind when he was sober, and a weeping, pants-pissing idiot when he drank. They told most people, or allowed most people to believe, that he was going to an artist’s residency for a month—something he had, in fact, done in the past. Saying “New Hampshire” to their writer friends was like saying “New Haven” to a certain (overlapping) kind of person; they just assumed you were being discreet about your good fortune. It wasn’t that she was so afraid of judgment. It was no secret that Aaron was something of a mess—he wrote about it, quite successfully, though he assured those who were concerned by the material that it was exaggerated for effect. Sure, he’d embarrassed himself at a few parties, but he’d never actually, for example, blacked out while camping with Cassie, gotten lost in the woods, broken his ankle after falling into a ravine, and nearly frozen to death while passed out in his own vomit, as his avatar did in a story he’d published in a prestigious low-circulation journal last summer. (He’d only sprained his ankle, but the rest was, unfortunately, true.) Okay, so maybe she was a bit afraid of judgment. People felt a certain way about charming ne’er-do-wells, but they often felt quite differently about lying alcoholics. He was waiting on the little sidewalk behind the facility when she arrived to pick him up, his enormous rolling suitcase standing between him and the discharge nurse like a stout, unloved child. “Hello, face!” he said. This was a reference to something; if she’d ever known its origin she’d forgotten it. It was what he always said when they’d been apart for a length of time greater than a day. “Hey, you,” she said. She’d ended up missing him even more than she’d expected to. For the first week he was away, she felt the relief and pleasure of not needing to answer to another person. She could take an edible as soon as she got home from work, watch gentle French comedies about amicable divorce, eat old olives and cheese from the fridge for dinner, masturbate. But this freedom soon became its own stultifying routine, and she missed the way she’d bent her life around Aaron’s. His mysterious excitements and longueurs provided a sense of event that she couldn’t conjure on her own. After a few minutes of cheery, if not particularly edifying conversation (“The best thing about rehab is leaving rehab, that’s for sure!”), he fell asleep with his head wedged against the window. He’d started taking Zoloft again at the facility, despite which, he said, he’d rarely slept more than a few hours at a time, being in a strange bed, in, one might say, less than ideal circumstances. But now, relief plus Zoloft plus a steadily moving vehicle driven by his one (?) true (?) love (??) knocked him straight out. He looked like he’d lost weight in the month since she’d last seen him. In one of their semiweekly phone calls from the approved landline—cell phones weren’t technically allowed, though the more obnoxiously entitled “guests” somehow managed to hold on to theirs, he told her—he’d been complimentary about the food. He’d been more or less complimentary about everything, certainly more positive than he’d been at home in at least a year, or maybe ever. She hoped this had something to do with “hitting bottom” (another thing Aaron did not believe in), but she suspected otherwise. His periods of sanguinity were most often the result of sex—actual, imagined, or immediately anticipated. This had, admittedly, not been much in abundance in any form through Cassie in the months leading up to or during his time away. It was hard, it turned out, to work up enthusiasm for sex with a very drunk depressed person. Though she had tried! She was hoping that, if he was now less depressed, and not drinking, they might be able to get back into it. Sex had not been a particular problem with them, traditionally. It was likely what kept them together during the early years, their way of making up, of rediscovering a common language, after one or another of his voyages into the ether. These voyages not infrequently involved the romantic company of other women, and, on at least one occasion that she knew of, a man. (“Oh, it was platonic,” he’d said about that one, eyebrow raised. “Deeply so.”) He would usually confess that he’d “fooled around,” but for whatever reason—either because it was true or because it was a narrative structure he could not imagine his way beyond—he would always insist that nothing “more serious” had happened. Which meant, in practical terms, that they could continue having unprotected sex. There was a grim exultation in not quite believing him, in allowing him to “get away” with this, even at the risk of her own health, though after a couple of his more extended absences, she’d insisted, despite his protestations, that he get tested before she let him back into their bed. She’d had her own minor dalliances, in part to curb her resentment at his, though she had been extremely careful, for her own sake and, secondarily, for Aaron’s. She wasn’t sure about the logistics of having an affair at an upscale rehab facility. The program featured “gender-separate accommodations,” but she knew that, at the very least, some meals and group therapy sessions were “mixed,” and Aaron needed, on average, about fifteen minutes to develop an infatuation, especially in an isolated setting. And the options were surely tantalizing—rich girls, too smart for their own good, addicted to drugs that made them thin and volatile. And he, an author (even if, by the odds, no one he met there would have read a word he’d written), attractive in his louche, overgrown-baby kind of way, deeply sympathetic to their stories, maybe even planning to write about them someday. His only type, he would tell them, was “interesting,” and if their particular malady did not qualify for whatever reason, they would find ways, she imagined, to make it do so. He was snoring loudly and irregularly, with what she hoped was not sleep apnea. At home, it was so rare for him to fall asleep before she did that she genuinely didn’t know whether he usually snored or not. In the mornings, when she got out of bed (always before him), he was often so quiet that she was afraid he was dead. But he never was. She tried now to adjust NPR so that it covered up some of the sound he was making without startling him awake. A segment was documenting the travails of a wind farm on the U.S.-Mexico border run jointly by ex–border patrol agents and formerly undocumented Central American laborers. “We want to work, we are ready to forgive,” said a chirpy voice in English over what sounded like a much more complicated statement in the original Spanish. Aaron was practically swimming in the pink-striped button-down shirt he was wearing. It had never fit him properly, and now that he was a little thinner, it looked like some kind of private joke. If she bought him an article of clothing, she had to be damn sure she liked it, because unless it fit so badly that he couldn’t physically wrangle it onto his body, or got lost or ruined in some misadventure, she knew she would be seeing it every other week for years to come. Cassie’s own style had emerged in her mid-twenties, after an athletic, sartorially indifferent extended adolescence. One weekend she accidentally borrowed a friend’s hot-pink leather jacket that had been left in her car, and wore it out over a ripped Rage Against the Machine T-shirt her brother had given her when she was twelve. It felt great. People assumed things about her. They imagined she was cool, literate, and a little strange, which was how she felt. It was that stupid, the thing that made her feel like herself. Aaron woke up in Connecticut, a little past Hartford. “Oh, hello again,” he said. He blinked at her, genuinely puzzled, it seemed, by the circumstances. “Good morning!” she said. “How long did I sleep?” “A couple hours. You were a tired boy.” “I guess, yeah,” he said. He instinctively started hitting the radio presets on the dashboard. None of them yielded anything he wanted to hear, because they were out of range of the Boston stations they were set to. He started scanning and settled on some up-tempo jazz. Coltrane? She thought everything was Coltrane. She was often right. “What are we going to do?” Aaron said. “In general. But also in New York.” “So, okay!” she said. “I have a plan. We don’t have to go if you aren’t up for it, but: I got us tickets for the opera tonight. It’s supposed to be a good one, but it’s not, like, a buzzy one for whatever reason, so tickets were actually pretty cheap. So it’s fine if you’d rather skip it. But I thought it would be a nice treat.” The tickets had, in fact, been quite expensive, and she knew (since he was the one who usually bought the tickets) that he probably knew this. But it was important that she give him a plausible out, even if it was more or less a given that he would feel obliged to act excited and grateful. She thought they needed to have the option of an activity that would occupy a significant span of time and take place in a zone that was familiar and comfortable. But she also didn’t want to throw him into the act of socializing yet. They were staying in a hotel that night, using a gift card they’d received from his father two Christmases ago but never had reason to use. It was for a moderately fancy hotel that allowed dogs, because they’d been planning to get a dog. Now of course she wanted to think about having kids, and they still hadn’t managed to agree on a fucking dog. Not even a cat! The next night they were scheduled to stay with Mark and Gilberte, who were among the few friends that knew the true nature of Aaron’s “residency.” Also their only close friends who still lived in Manhattan. One of the side priorities of the trip was to stay out of Brooklyn, both because the rest of their friends lived there, and because there was nothing to do there but drink. She hoped they would spend Saturday like a couple of rich tourists—brunch at some bright, Instagrammable Israeli place in SoHo, book browsing at Housing Works and McNally, an afternoon at either the Met or the new Whitney (which was no longer very new). Was she being insane in her optimism? She thought it was all right to strive for an ideal, maybe, even if its realization was more or less impossible. “The opera,” he said. “What a great idea, hon.” She couldn’t tell whether the flatness was a sign of a new temperament or an indication that he thought it was in fact a very bad idea. “We can see how we feel,” she said. “If we just feel like doing dinner and hanging out, we can do that.” “No, no, it’s awesome,” he said, still without feeling. “What, ah, opera is it? That they’re doing.” “The Queen of Spades, by Tchaikovsky? I don’t think I knew he’d written an opera, so that’s kind of interesting. And the star is supposed to be this hot young thing everyone’s excited about. I mean, opera hot, I don’t know if she’s supposed to be like, hot hot.” “I only leave my chambers for hot hot.” “Right, so, here’s hoping.” “I think it’s going to be great.” “Well, we’ll see how we feel,” she said. She was driving herself crazy with the hedging but she couldn’t stop. They got stuck in traffic in Connecticut, because Connecticut was designed, under its original colonial charter, to delay people traveling into New York from points north. She hadn’t wanted to stop to pee while Aaron was sleeping, but now that they weren’t moving, her need had gone from manageable to really quite urgent. She knew there had to be a gas station with a Dunkin’ Donuts in the next ten miles or so (thank you, New England), but how long it would be until they got that far was unknowable. “I’m going to actually explode with urine,” she said. “This is how it ends for me.” “Do you want to run to the side of the road? I can sit behind the wheel for a second.” “Sit behind the wheel” was an acknowledgment that his license was suspended, and ineligible for reinstatement for at least a year. He was not legally allowed to drive, not even in Connecticut. “I can wait,” she said. “It just sucks.” “Here, let’s do it,” he said. “It’ll be okay. Nobody cares.” “I care. I don’t feel comfortable. I’m just going to fucking suffer.” “Okay. As long as you understand you don’t have to.” Right, so she was choosing unhappiness now. They inched along and her discomfort grew. They’d picked up a rap station and she listened to DaBaby explain for the hundredth time that he needed some isht with some bop in it. The fact that they still censored the radio was further proof that they lived in a doomed country with ridiculous priorities. Her irritation with Aaron rose in direct proportion to how badly she needed to pee, which probably meant that she wasn’t being fair. It really wasn’t logistically possible for her to piss safely and unobserved, so their disagreement was mostly philosophical. But for him to be out of rehab for just a couple of hours and casually float that he do something illegal, no matter how briefly and inconsequentially, was upsetting to her. She gave him a lot of leeway, she thought, when it came to blame and guilt, but she wanted that to be repaid with some care for her feelings. Finally, just when she had resigned herself to peeing into an empty coffee cup, the traffic let up a little and she used her training as a New Jersey teenager, weaving back and forth between the two lanes of traffic as fast as she could until, yes, a Dunkin’-themed service center materialized ahead on her right. She had, again, discovered inner resources she hadn’t been sure she possessed. She made it. They pulled into the city a little after four, the sunlight already declining toward golden hour. It had been a mild winter in Boston, and it was even warmer here, hovering in the high forties in mid-January. She had declared herself a winter person at some point, possibly to be contrary at first, but the longer she kept to the position the more she felt it to be true. In the summer she felt doughy and slow-witted, unable to process the world mentally or physically without effort. But the cold activated her, encouraged her. She could harness its powers. She parked the car in the garage associated with the hotel. It would cost $45 a day, and she very much hoped that she would be able to cover it with the gift card. She decided to simply pretend to be sure that she would. Re: money, it was complicated. Or maybe not that complicated. Aaron, in general, had money. His parents were rich, and despite his regular betrayal of their trust, they supplemented his sporadic writing and teaching income whenever they were called upon. In the delicate manner of such things, however, Aaron much preferred not to call upon them, and to instead rely on Cassie’s money when his ran low. She taught history at a Catholic prep school in a Boston suburb and made plenty for regular human expenses. She just didn’t make enough to pay for lawyers, fines, upscale rehab, thrice-weekly therapy not covered by insurance, etc. Plus, unlike Aaron, she was trying to actually save some of the money she made, just in case she, you know, lived past the age of forty. It was of course the marginal expenses, rather than the big ones, that created resentments—the assumption that she would pick up a dinner tab without thinking about how long it was until payday, his decision to purchase a vintage reading chair (with “his own money”) during an unusually freezing November, when the cost of heating the house (her responsibility) raised their rent by a third. He was careless rather than intentionally unhelpful, which meant that when disparities or expenses were brought to his attention he sometimes became emotional, if not dramatic. This is all to say: it often felt easier to quietly pay for the thing than to open herself up to the possibility of an unpleasant conversation, which would not, in any case, yield a different outcome. The lobby of the hotel featured large statues of dogs, and there were small bronze dogs on the marble check-in desk, but she did not see (or hear or smell!) any actual animals. She wondered how many people would really think it was a good idea to come to New York City and leave their dog in a hotel room, even if it was allowed. Perhaps people with better-trained dogs than the ones owned by her friends and family? She checked them in and they took the elevator to the ninth floor. “What are you thinking?” Cassie said. “Um. I hope there’s enough time to fuck you before we have to go to dinner,” he said. “Oh, is that something that’s been on your mind?” “I don’t want to hope for too much,” he said. “I guess it’s partly a question of what you’ve been up to since the last time I saw you.” He checked her face to assess whether this was just banter, or something more. The answer, of course, depended on his response. He clucked his tongue softly, a default response that was meant to signal playful disapproval, but actually conveyed annoyance that he wasn’t willing to fully articulate. “You know what I’ve been up to,” he said. The room was small, but clean and ... “contemporary” was the word, maybe? “Boutique-y?” “Not explicitly corporate but not a shithole?” The theme of this floor seemed to be “New York in the Seventies, but not in a scary way.” There was a framed black-and-white photo of the outside of CBGB. There was a framed black-and-white photo of Debbie Harry. Sure. Cassie remembered when the height of modernity in hotel furnishings was a Bose radio with a built-in CD player, and then when it was the same thing, but with an iPod dock. This room had a suitcase record player with the first Ramones album on the turntable. The “record library,” a card on the desk said, could be browsed on the hotel’s website, and selections would be brought to the room upon request. She felt the deep sadness of being a human being at this moment in world history. Aaron sat down on the bed and stared at his lap. Cassie wondered whether he was falling back asleep. If so, there was no way they were going to make it through the opera. Given the average age of the Met’s audience members, though, he would hardly be the only one sleeping through the middle acts. He lifted his head and met her eyes. “Hey,” he said. “Hello,” she said. “You sleepin’?” “Certainly not.” She took small, self-consciously seductive steps toward him. She noticed for the first time the bottle of wine on the cabinet, next to the TV, a gift from the hotel, presumably—a little card dangling from the neck. She wasn’t overly worried about Aaron being tempted by its presence. She was confident that he would earnestly try to reform himself for at least a month before the first hints of backsliding began to appear. Despite his posturing, he was a sincere person, one who tried to believe the things he was told, to swallow whatever had been suggested might help him to improve himself. The problem, he’d told her one night, drunk, was that he got bored. Everything was always the same, the same, the same, and he didn’t know how to change things. “I’m not the same,” she said. “I’m a human, I change every minute. Isn’t that interesting enough?” “I guess I need to try harder to notice,” he said. “That would probably help my writing too. I never know what’s actually going on.” What was funny was that he did seem to know what was going on in his writing, even if he evinced little of this knowledge in his daily life. They kissed, gently at first, and then the full tongue thing. She thought there was something slightly tentative and unenthusiastic about his kissing—it didn’t seem as urgent as she thought it should given their time apart. There were many possibilities for why this might have been the case; she knew it wasn’t fair to assume he had gotten involved, or infatuated, or whatever. Was it, as her mother had suggested during an earlier iteration of this situation, that Cassie wanted him to lose interest in her so that she might finally be done with this whole repetitive cycle? Sure, of course. She was interested in other people, too. She was a person. Caleb, who taught English to the sophomores, had made it clear that he’d be willing to give up his life (which consisted of not much besides teaching and smoking weed, as far as she knew) to follow her wherever she’d be willing to take him. She was pretty sure she didn’t want to adopt Caleb, but did she think about keeping him under her desk for some after-school help with grading? Yes, she did. Did she eye the spoiled college girl on the T wearing bright white high-tops, a blue romper, and an obscene, goose-murdering puffy coat and imagine taking her home with the promise of... what could she promise such a girl? TikTok followers? Having sex with Cassie would probably not increase the girl’s TikTok followers. Aaron was not a childish middle-school teacher or a BU brat, but she could treat him like one. She pushed his shoulders down so he lay on his back, pushed his hands up over his head. She unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them off with his boxers. “Doesn’t seem like you’re ready for me yet,” she said. “Stay there.” She took her vibrator out of her shoulder bag and lay down next to him. She turned it on at the lowest setting and pulled her tights down to her ankles. She closed her eyes, pressed down. It took her a couple of minutes, but she was getting into it. “Is this what you’ve been thinking about, Aar?” She opened her eyes. He was asleep. They took the subway to the opera house. She had recently read, on Thelonious Monk’s Wikipedia page, that a black neighborhood known as San Juan Hill had been bulldozed in order to build the Lincoln Center complex in the 1960s. Of course, she’d never really thought about what had been there before the theaters, most of which were now emblazoned with the names of right-wing oligarchs. She remembered the time she’d gone canvassing for local candidates in Brooklyn, back when they lived in the city. She’d been assigned the Ebbets Field Apartments, a massive, run-down housing complex just past her neighborhood. Only afterward had it occurred to her that the echoing halls and stairwells she’d been trudging through were perched above the field where Jackie Robinson had played. For better or worse, she was past the point of feeling actively sad about these kinds of things. They just drove home the point that New York was a landscape full of ghosts. Cassie didn’t want to wake Aaron up, so she decided to cancel the dinner reservation she’d made at a homey, old-school Italian place where they’d once been together, another attempt at nostalgic foundation building for Aaron’s new life of sobriety, or something. Instead they participated in what was, admittedly, an even more evocative ritual: finding the nearest pizza counter and wolfing down greasy slices coated in self-administered oregano and red pepper flakes, under the forbearing eyes of random half-smiling celebrities surprised into photos with the owners and staff. Between bites of “barbecue chicken” pizza (why, Aaron?), he apologized for being so exhausted. It must have been, he said, that his body finally felt like it was out of danger. “Is there anybody from back in the, um, danger zone that you’re going to keep in touch with?” Cassie said. “Or you’ve had enough of them.” Casual, casual. “No, a few of us are going to meet on Skype or whatever once everybody’s back out in the world,” Aaron said. “I dunno, maybe it’s gonna be like summer camp where everybody promises to stay in touch and then you don’t. But I think people actually felt pretty connected.” “Did you?” “I think so. I mean, maybe as much as I ever do, I guess.” “That Mary you mentioned on the phone, is she in the group?” She had picked this person more or less arbitrarily. He had been pretty sparse with his information, but a Mary, an Amir, and a Laurel had come up in positive contexts during his brief calls. Cassie had spent a good amount of the past month trying to picture these people. She ended up with shadowy approximations of humans, like TV actors who sort of resembled movie stars. “Yeah, Mary’s in it. This guy Christian—I don’t think I’ve ever known a Christian in real life before. Carlson, my roommate from the first two weeks. That girl Leonora I told you about.” Had Laurel actually been Leonora? She felt like she would have remembered a Leonora, because of Leonora Carrington. He hadn’t hesitated even a little when he mentioned her, but still, her radar went up. “What’s Leonora’s story?” she said. She tried not to italicize the name, the classic tell. “Oh, she’s a mess. Like the whole gang, though maybe even more so. But she’s funny. Self-aware about it.” “Cute?” “As the dickens,” he said. “A regular Little Dorrit.” The fact that he was making a joke of it was Not Great. “Is she, uh, out? Or still there?” “She left a week ago. It seems like she’s been really struggling. It’s a shame. She’s a cool person.” Cassie didn’t push any further, but she, of course, noted all of this. Now, at the opera, she felt overwhelmed by the sea of people, many of whom were dressed much more expensively and formally than she and Aaron were. When they had lived in the city, they’d come to the Met often enough that they were comfortable being there in whatever they were wearing. They usually sat way up at the top of the house, in the cheap seats, surrounded by other young people in street clothes who, judging by conversations, often seemed to be musicians, singers, and actors. She’d enjoyed the semi-backstage feeling of sitting among the regulars. To pay thirty-five dollars and not dress up made her feel like she was experiencing the true spirit of the art rather than merely basking in the social display that had, admittedly, been the main function of the medium since its invention. But the time away had made her self-conscious. The seats she’d bought were in the orchestra, among very old couples in tuxedos and black dresses, Russians draped in expensive furs, and families with embalmed-looking teenagers staring blankly ahead in doll-person outfits. But once the curtain opened, she felt a rush of relief and pleasure. She’d been right! It was better, much better, to be closer to the stage, to see the trembling mouths of the singers, to feel the crashing orchestra in her body, to have the ornate ceiling towering over their heads. It was thanks to money that she was having this experience. She had successfully paid her way to aesthetic ecstasy. At least, now that they were here, she could stop worrying and be overwhelmed by the beauty of what was in front of her. The moment she thought this, she began to worry. Aaron seemed happy, sort of. Or, at least, he wasn’t asleep or looking actively miserable. She wondered if he was thinking about his phone, itching to check it and see what Leonora had said about her latest struggles. To be fair, he’d hardly been glued to his phone; she certainly would have been if she’d been away from it for a month. But what if ... what if Aaron didn’t need to look at it now because he’d had his phone the whole time? And he’d just told her he didn’t so he wouldn’t have to keep in touch with her? Onstage there was a sung discussion of a secret card trick that could only be learned from ... a ghost? She didn’t quite trust the translations that appeared on the backs of the seats, and she hadn’t had time to read the synopsis beforehand. This fellow really, really wanted to know the secret card trick that would help him win an incomprehensible card game. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that Aaron wasn’t being truthful in some fundamental way. But maybe it was just the therapy and the drugs? Maybe this was what reformation looked like and she was, through her suspicion, imperiling his recovery. She would try not to do this. But what if his demeanor didn’t indicate a struggle for redemption, but was, rather, a sign of resignation? To being bored, to being lonely. Or just: to drinking. His face remained a rictus of vague pleasure. At intermission they walked up to the highest floor, where they usually sat, so they could look over the bannister of the spiraling stairs and watch the ecosystem of operagoers from above. People drank $25 glasses of champagne from plastic flutes. They’d been at the opera once on her birthday, and Aaron had insisted they get champagne. She’d managed to talk him down to one glass for them to share, and the overlapping novelties—the expense, the venue, the shared glass—had tipped the frustrating experience into something pleasurable. But it was too wasteful; she vowed never to do it again. “So is she as good as you hoped?” Aaron said. “Oh,” Cassie said. The singer. “She seems solid, though she hasn’t really gotten to do much yet. I think her big number is in the next act.” “I still feel like I can’t really tell,” Aaron said. “You could probably trick me into thinking someone who was just fine was really amazing, or vice versa. That means ‘the opposite’ in Latin.” “I trust the Met not to fuck with me,” Cassie said. “Except for when they were doing all that Spider-Man the Musical shit with the Ring cycle. I don’t really need to see, like, machines on the stage to know it’s epic.” Aaron smiled emptily at this. It was his riff; she was just covering it. He didn’t pick it up. “You okay?” she said. “I think so,” he said. He sighed heavily. “This is so, so fun, but I do feel pretty insane, you know? It’s just a lot. I might be losing it a little.” Of course he was. Fuck. Of course it was. “That was plenty of opera for one night,” she said. “No, I’m fine,” he said. He widened his fake smile to a painful-looking aperture. “I want to see the big number.” “I think I’d rather go,” she said. “We’ve barely even gotten to talk, you know? We can come back to the opera whenever. It’s not, you know, changing my life. It’s fine.” He’d begun weeping while she said this, but she could see him trying to keep it together. He took off his glasses and pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose. “I’m sorry,” he said. “It’s not specific. I’m just feeling a kind of, um, general fragility, I guess.” The intermission bells were dinging, and the lights had begun to flash on and off. A few months later, when it became clear that neither they, nor anyone else, would be going to theaters of any kind for a very long time, she remembered this moment. If she had known what was coming—the grief and the loneliness, the full banishment from the places that had sustained her for so much of her life—would she have insisted, against her better judgment, that they stay? She wanted, then, to hear the awaited aria almost as much as she wanted to comfort Aaron. Later, when the full scale of the loss became clear, she thought reproachfully that Aaron would have been just fine sitting through one more act, maybe two. He wouldn’t have been any worse in the audience, his hand on hers, than in the hotel room. It was fine to cry at the opera. It was perfectly natural. “Come on,” she said. She put her arm through his, like a formal escort, and they descended the stairs to the front door, and then went out into the cold night. She was woken from a deep sleep in darkness, in the unfamiliar room, by a harsh, insistent buzzing on the nightstand. She never set her phone to vibrate—it was on or off, damn it—so her first thought was that it was Aaron’s phone. Only a death could prompt a call this late. Or a selfish female alcoholic, desperate for words of solace. Aaron had not been able to articulate his source of upset in the hours after they left the opera. His problem was “everything,” but also that he “didn’t actually have any real problems, and that was probably the problem, at the end of the day.” He hated himself, and he hated how other people made him feel, and he hated that he’d made Cassie’s life so difficult, and he knew that he had to be a completely different person now, but he didn’t know if he could be, and he was afraid of losing an important part of himself, and he was afraid of losing her. She sympathized with all of this, to some extent, but it all felt oddly abstract, like he was upset about concepts rather than real things. She couldn’t help but continue to suspect that he was pretending, on some level—maybe even to himself—to be overwhelmed, to avoid something else. The buzzing against the nightstand continued. It was on her side of the bed. Aaron muttered something, only half awake. She reached over to pick up the phone and felt, instead, the bulbous silicone head of her vibrator, which was, seemingly of its own volition, turned to the highest setting and doing its best to fulfill its mandate. She pressed the power button but it continued to shudder, now pulsing in quick, discrete bursts. She didn’t know it could do that! She held down the button forcefully and the thing quieted. She tossed it on the floor and tried to go back to sleep. She had just drifted off, or so it felt, when she woke to the sound again, the machine again on its newfound setting. As a message from the gods, it lacked both subtlety and tact, though it was nice that these gods seemed to have a sense of humor. This time the vibrator refused to be silenced. Every time she pressed the button it simply buzzed in a new pattern. Oh, this was what you wanted, got it. No? Oh, buzz every three seconds, got it. Oh, every five seconds, cool. Oh, never mind, you want me to buzz really softly but consistently. She carried it into the bathroom, wrapped it in a towel, then another one, and left it in the tub. She spent the next hour straining to see if she could still hear it, until she finally got up and took a couple of Tylenol PM. When she lay back down, her mind, blessedly, went blank, and then dark. When she woke to the gray morning light, Aaron was not in bed. He was not, as far as she could tell, in the room at all. The bathroom door was closed, but he didn’t answer when she called, and she found it unlocked. Aaron’s toothbrush and toiletry bag were not on the counter. The vibrator was still in the tub, in its swaddling clothes. It seemed to have worn itself out. She went back into the room and sat down on the bed. The bottle of wine next to the TV was gone. She had a text from the Bernie campaign and one from her friend Rachel, who was “just checkin in boo.” She had no missed calls. Aaron’s giant coffin of a suitcase was still leaning against the wall next to the closet but, she now noticed, the contents of her tote bag—a fat Italian novel about World War II, an empty contact lens case, sunglasses, a tampon—were piled neatly on top of it. She read her novel for a half hour, then set it down to look up the plot of The Queen of Spades and find out what she’d missed. Death by fright, suicide, dramatic card game, suicide. Didn’t anyone in an opera ever decide to just keep muddling through? From a nearby room, she finally heard a real dog barking. It sounded celebratory, rather than fearful or aggressive. Someone had come back! Dogs, she thought, were very forgiving. They knew, at least, where the food was coming from.

        "story": "In a small seaside town perched on the outer shores of East Anglia, a thirty-three-year-old bookseller named Julian Lawndsley emerged from the side door of his brand-new shop and, clutching to his throat the velvet collars of a black overcoat left over from the City life he had renounced two months previously, set off at a forward lean to battle his way along the desolate seafront of shingle beach in search of the one café that served breakfast at this dismal time of year.  Buy a copy at\nBarnes and Noble\nPenguin Random House\nAmazon\nBookshop.org His mood was not friendly, either toward himself or the world at large. Last night, after hours of solitary stocktaking, he had climbed the stairs to his newly converted attic flat above the shop to discover he had neither electric power nor running water. The builder’s phone was on answer. Rather than take a hotel room, if one was even to be found at that time of year, he lit four kitchen candles, uncorked a bottle of red wine, poured himself a large glass, piled spare blankets on the bed, got into it, and buried himself in the shop’s accounts. They told him nothing he didn’t know. His impulsive escape from the rat race had gotten off to a wretched start. And if the accounts didn’t say the rest of it, he could say it for himself: he was not equipped for the loneliness of celibacy; the clamorous voices of his recent past were not to be quelled by distance; and his lack of the basic literary education required of your upmarket bookseller was not to be repaired in a couple of months. The one café was a clapboard shack squeezed behind a row of Edwardian beach huts under a blackened sky packed with screaming seabirds. He had seen the place on his morning runs, but the thought of entering it had never crossed his mind. A faulty green sign flickered with the word ice minus its s. Forcing the door open, he held it against the wind, entered and eased it back into place. “Good morning, my dear!” yelled a hearty female voice from the direction of the kitchen. “You seat you anywhere! I come soon, okay?” “And good morning to you,” he called vaguely in return. Under fluorescent lights lay a dozen empty tables covered in red plastic gingham. He chose one and cautiously extracted the menu from a cluster of cruets and sauce bottles. The babble of a foreign news announcer issued through the open kitchen door. A crash and a shuffle of heavy feet from behind him informed him of the advent of another guest. Glancing at the wall mirror, he was guardedly amused to recognize the egregious person of Mr. Edward Avon, his importunate but engaging customer of the previous evening, if a customer who had bought nothing. Though he had yet to see his face—Avon, with his air of perpetual motion, being far too preoccupied with hanging up his broad-brimmed homburg hat and adjusting his dripping fawn raincoat over the back of a chair—there was no mistaking the rebellious mop of white hair or the unexpectedly delicate fingers as, with a defiant flourish, they extracted a folded copy of the Guardian newspaper from the recesses of the raincoat and flattened it on the table before him. It is yesterday evening, five minutes to closing time. The shop is empty. It has been empty for most of the day. Julian is standing at the till, totting up the day’s meager takings. For some minutes he has been aware of a solitary figure in a homburg hat and fawn raincoat, armed with a furled umbrella, standing on the opposite pavement. After six weeks of running a stagnant business, he has become quite the connoisseur of people who stare at the shop and don’t come in, and they are beginning to get on his nerves. Is it the shop’s pea-green paintwork the man’s disapproving of—he’s an old inhabitant maybe, and doesn’t like garish? Is it the many fine books on display, special offers to suit all pockets? Or is it Bella, Julian’s twenty-year-old Slovakian trainee, frequently to be found occupying the shop window in search of her various love interests? It is not. Bella is for once gainfully employed in the stockroom, packing unsold books to be returned to their publishers. And now—miracle of miracles—the man is actually making his way across the street, he is removing his hat, the shop door is opening, and a sixty-something face under a mop of white hair is peering round it at Julian. “You’re shut,” an assured voice informs him. “You’re shut, and I shall come another time, I insist”—but already one muddy brown walking shoe is inside the door, and the other is easing its way after it, followed by the umbrella. “Not shut at all, actually,” Julian assures him, matching smooth for smooth. “Technically, we close at five-thirty, but we’re flexible, so please just come in and take all the time you need”—and, with this, resumes his counting while the stranger studiously threads his umbrella into the Victorian umbrella stand and hangs his homburg on the Victorian hat stand, thereby paying his respects to the shop’s retro style, selected to appeal to older customers, of which the town has a plentiful supply. “Looking for something particular or just browsing?” Julian asks, turning up the bookshelf lights to full. But his customer barely hears this question. His broad, clean-shaven face, mobile as any actor’s, is alight with marvel. “I’d absolutely no idea at all,” he protests, indicating with a flowing gesture of his arm the source of all his wonderment. “The town may boast a real-life bookshop at last. I am amazed, I must say. Totally.” His position now manifest, he sets off on a reverential inspection of the shelves—fiction, non-fiction, local interest, travel, classical, religion, art, poetry—here and there pausing to fish down a volume and subject it to some kind of bibliophile’s test: front cover, inside flap, quality of paper, binding, general weight and friendliness. “I must say,” he exclaims again. Is the voice entirely English? It’s rich, interesting, and compelling. But is there not a very slight foreign flavor in the cadence? “You must say what?” he calls back from his tiny office, where he is running through the day’s emails. The stranger begins again, on a different and more confiding note. “Look here. I’m assuming that your magnificent new shop is under entirely different management. Am I right, or am I barking up the completely wrong tree?” “New management is right”—still from his office, through the open doorway. And yes, there is a foreign flavor. Just. “New ownership also, one may ask?” “One may, and the answer is emphatically yes,” Julian agrees cheerfully, taking up his former position beside the till. “Then are you—forgive me.” He starts again, severely, on a more military note: “Look here—are you by any chance, or are you not, the young mariner himself? Because I need to know. Or are you his deputy? His surrogate? His whatever?” And then, arbitrarily concluding, with some reason, that Julian is offended by these searching questions: “I mean absolutely nothing personal, I assure you. I mean only that, whereas your undistinguished predecessor christened his emporium the Ancient Mariner, you, sir, as his more youthful and may I say vastly more acceptable successor—” By which time, the two of them are in a silly all-English tangle, until everything is properly patched up, with Julian confessing that, yes, indeed, he is both manager and owner, and the stranger saying, “Mind awfully if I help myself to one of these?” and deftly winkling a get-to-know-us card from its housing with his long pointy fingers, and holding it to the light to scrutinize the evidence with his own eyes. Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. “So I am addressing, correct me if I’m wrong, Mr. J. J. Lawndsley in person, sole owner and manager of Lawndsley’s Better Books,” he concludes, lowering his arm with theatrical slowness. “Fact or fiction?”—then swinging round to observe Julian’s response. “Fact,” Julian confirms. “And the first J, if one may make so bold?” “One may, and it’s Julian.” “A great Roman emperor. And the second—even bolder?” “Jeremy.” “But not the other way round?” “Never on any account.” “Does one call you Jay-Jay?” “Personally, I recommend plain Julian.” The stranger ponders this with knitted brows, which are prominent and gingery, and flecked with white. “Then, sir, you are Julian Lawndsley, not his portrait, not his shadow, and I for my sins am Edward Avon, like the river. I may be Ted or Teddy to the many, but to my peers I am Edward all alone. How d’you do, Julian?”—thrusting a hand across the counter, the grip surprisingly powerful, despite the fine fingers. “Well, hullo, Edward,” Julian replies jauntily and, withdrawing his hand as soon as he is decently able, waits while Edward Avon makes a show of deliberating his next move. “Will you permit me, Julian, to say something personal and potentially offensive?” “As long as it’s not too personal,” Julian replies warily, but in a similarly light vein. “Then would you mind frightfully if, with all due diffidence, one made an absolutely footling recommendation regarding your extremely impressive new stock?” “As many as you like,” Julian replies hospitably, as the danger cloud recedes. “It is a totally personal judgment and merely reflects my own feelings on the matter. Is that clearly understood?” Evidently it is. “Then I shall proceed. It is my considered view that no local interest shelf in this magnificent county, or in any other county for that matter, should regard itself as complete without Sebald’s Rings of Saturn. But I see you are not familiar with Sebald.” See from what, Julian wonders, even as he concedes that the name is indeed new to him, and all the more so since Edward Avon has used the German pronunciation, Zaybult. “The Rings of Saturn, I must warn you in advance, is not a guidebook as you and I might understand the term. I’m being pompous. Will you forgive me?” He will. “The Rings of Saturn is a literary sleight of hand of the first water. The Rings of Saturn is a spiritual journey that takes off from the marshes of East Anglia and embraces the entire cultural heritage of Europe, even unto death. Sebald, W. G.”—this time using the English pronunciation and waiting while Julian writes it down. “Formerly professor of European literature at our University of East Anglia, a depressive like the best of us, now, alas, dead. Weep for Sebald.” “I will,” Julian promises, still writing. “I have overstayed my welcome, sir. I have purchased nothing, I am good for nothing, and I am in awe. Good night, sir. Good night, Julian. All good fortune with your superb new enterprise—but wait! Is that a basement I see?” Edward Avon’s eye has lighted on a descending spiral staircase tucked into the further corner of the Reduced to Clear department, and partly concealed by a Victorian screen. “Empty, I’m afraid,” Julian says, returning to his takings. “But empty for what purpose, Julian? In a bookshop? There must be no empty spaces, surely!” “Still thinking about it, actually. Maybe a secondhand department. We’ll see”—beginning to tire. “I may take a look?” Edward Avon insists. “Out of shameless curiosity? You allow?” What can Julian do but allow? “Light switch on your left as you go down. Watch your step.” With a nimbleness that takes Julian by surprise, Edward Avon vanishes down the spiral staircase. Julian listens, waits, hears nothing, and puzzles at himself. Why did I let him do that? The man’s as mad as a flute. As nimbly as he vanished, Avon reappears. “Magnificent,” he declares reverently. “A chamber of future delights. I congratulate you unreservedly. Good night, once more.” “So may I ask what you do?” Julian calls after him as he starts toward the door. “I, sir?” “You, sir. Are you a writer yourself? An artist? A journalist? An academic? I should know, I’m sure, but I’m new here.” The question appears to puzzle Edward Avon as much as it does Julian. “Well,” he replies, having apparently given the matter much thought. “Let us say I am a British mongrel, retired, a former academic of no merit, and one of life’s odd-job men. Will that do you?” “I guess it will have to.” “I bid you anon, then,” Edward Avon declares, casting him a last wistful look from the door. “And anon to you,” Julian calls cheerfully back. At which Edward Avon-like-the-river dons his homburg hat, adjusts its angle and, umbrella in hand, sweeps bravely into the night. But not before Julian has been subjected to the heavy aroma of alcoholic fumes on his departing breath. “You decide what you wanna eat today, my dear?” the proprietor asked Julian in the same strong mid-European accent with which she had greeted his arrival. But before he could answer, Edward Avon’s rich voice resounded over the boom of the sea wind and the creaks and groans of the café’s flimsy walls: “Good morning to you, Julian. You rested soundly amid the turmoil, I trust? I suggest you go for one of Adrianna’s bumper omelets. She does them remarkably well.” “Oh, right. Thanks,” Julian returned, not yet quite willing to use the Edward. “I’ll give it a shot.” And to the ample waitress standing at his shoulder: “With brown toast and a pot of tea, please.” “You want fluffy, like I make Edvard?” “Fluffy’s fine.” And, to Avon, resignedly: “So is this a favorite watering hole of yours?” “When the urge takes me. Adrianna is one of our little town’s best-kept secrets, aren’t you, darling?” The insistent voice, for all its verbal flourishes, struck Julian as a trifle underpowered this morning, as well it might be, if last night’s breath was anything to go by. Adrianna clumped happily back to the kitchen. An uneasy truce reigned, while the sea wind howled and the gimcrack building heaved under the stress and Edward Avon studied his newspaper, while Julian had to content himself with staring at the rainswept window. “Julian?” “Yes, Edward?” “A most amazing coincidence, actually. I was a friend of your late lamented father.” Another crash of rain followed. “Oh, really? How extraordinary,” Julian replied, at his most English. “We were incarcerated in the same appalling public school together. Henry Kenneth Lawndsley. But to his school friends fondly known as the great HK.” “He often said his school days were the happiest of his life,” Julian conceded, not at all convinced. “And, alas, if one surveys the poor fellow’s life, one might sadly conclude that he was speaking no less than the truth,” said Avon. And after that, nothing except the crashing of the wind again, and the foreign gabble of the radio from the kitchen, and Julian discovering an urgent need to get back to the empty bookshop where he didn’t yet belong. “I suppose one might,” he agreed dully, and was grateful to see Adrianna approaching with the fluffy omelet and his tea. “You allow I join you?” Whether Julian allowed or not, Avon had already risen to his feet, coffee in hand, leaving Julian not knowing which to be more surprised by: the man’s evident familiarity with his father’s unfortunate life, or Avon’s reddened eyes sunk into their sockets, cheeks cracked with pain lines and coated in silvery stubble. If this was last night’s hangover, the man must have been on the bender of a lifetime. “So did your dear father ever mention me?” he asked when he had sat down, leaning forward and appealing to Julian with his haggard brown eyes. “Avon? Teddy Avon?” Not that Julian remembered. Sorry. “The Patricians Club? He didn’t speak of the Patricians to you?” “He did. Yes, he did,” Julian exclaimed, the last of his doubts for better or worse receding. “The debating club that never was. Set up by my father and banned after half a meeting. He nearly got slung out for it. As he tells it—or did,” he added cautiously, since his late father’s accounts of himself did not always stand the test of accuracy. “HK was club chairman, I was his vice. They nearly threw me out too. I very much wish they had”—swig of cold black coffee—“Anarchists, Bolsheviks, Trotskyites: whatever doctrine enraged the Establishment, we hastened to adopt it.” “That’s pretty much how he described it too,” Julian acknowledged, then waited, as Avon did, each for the other to play the next card. “And then, oh dear, your father went up to Oxford,” Avon recalled at length, with a stage shudder, and a lowering of the underpowered voice, and a clown’s lift of the bushy eyebrows to heaven, followed by a sideways glance at Julian to see how he was responding, “where he fell into the hands”—placing his own hand on Julian’s forearm in sympathy—“but perhaps you are of a religious disposition, Julian?” “I’m not,” Julian replied emphatically, his anger rising. “I may go on, then?” Julian went on for him: “Where my father fell into the hands of a bunch of American-financed born-again evangelical mind-benders with short hair and smart ties who carted him off to a Swiss mountaintop and turned him into a fire-breathing Christian. Is that what you wanted to say?” “Perhaps not in such harsh language, but I could not have put it better. And you are truly not religiously disposed?” “Truly not.” “Then you have the foundations of wisdom within your grasp. There he was at Oxford, poor man, ‘as happy as Larry,’ as he wrote to me, his whole life before him, girls galore—yes, they were his weakness, and why not?—and, by the end of his second year—” “They’d got him, okay?” Julian cut in. “And ten years after he’d been ordained into the holy Anglican Church, he recanted his faith from the pulpit in front of his whole Sunday flock: I, the Reverend H.K.Lawndsley, Clerk in Holy Orders, do hereby declare that God does not exist, amen. Is that what you were going to say?” Was Edward Avon proposing they now dwell on his father’s prolific sex life and other dissipations, as widely aired in the gutter press of the day? Was he pressing for the gory details of how the once-proud Lawndsley family was turfed out of its vicarage into the street without a penny? And how Julian himself, in the wake of his father’s premature death, had to dump his hopes of university and become a runner in a City trading house owned by a remote uncle, in order to pay off his father’s debts and put bread on his mother’s table? Because, if he were, Julian was going to be out of the door in twenty seconds cold. But Edward Avon’s expression, far from salacious curiosity, was the very mask of heartfelt sympathy. “And you were there, Julian?” “Where?” “In the church?” “As it happened, yes, I was. Where were you?” “I wished only to be at his side. As soon as I read what had happened to him—a little late, alas—I wrote to him posthaste, offering whatever inadequate help I could. The hand of friendship, such money as I had.” Julian allowed himself time to consider this. “You wrote to him,” he repeated, in a questioning tone, as the shades of his earlier disbelief returned. “And did you ever get an answer?” “I received none and I deserved none. On the last occasion your father and I met, I had called him a Holy Fool. I could hardly take it amiss when he spurned my offer. We have no right to insult another man’s faith, however absurd it is. You agree?” “Probably.” “Naturally, when HK renounced his faith I was filled with pride for him. As indeed vicariously, dare I say it, I am filled with pride for you, Julian.” “You are what?” Julian exclaimed, laughing out loud despite himself. “You mean because I’m HK’s son and I’ve opened a bookshop?” But Edward Avon found nothing to laugh at. “Because, like your dear father, you found the courage to defect: he from God and you from Mammon.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” “I understand you were a highly successful trader in the City.” “Who told you that?” Julian demanded stubbornly. “Last night after leaving your shop, I prevailed on Celia to allow me to use her computer. Immediately, all was revealed, to my enormous sadness. Your poor father, dead at fifty, one son, Julian Jeremy.” “Celia, your wife?” “Celia of Celia’s Bygones, your distinguished neighbor in the high street and collecting point for our overgrowing population of rich weekenders from London.” “Why did you have to go sneaking off to Celia’s? Why didn’t you just come out with it in the shop?” “I was divided. As you would be. I hoped, but I was uncertain.” “You were also pretty refreshed, if I recall.” Avon appeared not to hear this: “I was immediately drawn by the name. I knew only too well there had been a scandal. I had no idea how the drama had played out, nor of your poor father’s death. If you were HK’s son, I could imagine how you had suffered.” “And my supposed defection from the City?” Julian asked, refusing to be appeased. “Celia happened to mention that you had abandoned a lucrative livelihood in the City at no notice, and she was appropriately mystified.” Julian would have liked very much at this point to return to the little matter of Edward Avon’s claim to have offered his father the earth in his hour of need, but Edward Avon had other ideas. He had rallied remarkably. There was a new zeal in his eyes. His voice had recovered its flowery richness: “Julian. In the name of your dear father. And since Providence has twice brought us together in the space of a few hours. Concerning your large and beautiful basement: Have you considered what treasures it might contain, what a work of miracle it might be?” “Well, no, as a matter of fact, I don’t think I quite have, Edward,” Julian replied. “Have you?” “I have thought of little else since we met.” “Glad to hear it,” Julian said, not without skepticism. “Suppose you created—in that splendid space, still virgin—something so untried, so alluring and original, as to be the talking point of every literate and would-be literate customer in the area?” “Suppose.” “Not a mere secondhand books department. Not an arbitrary book depository of no character, but a purposefully selected shrine to the most challenging minds of our time—and of all time. A place where a man or woman may come off the street knowing nothing, and leave enlarged, enriched, and craving more. Why do you smile?” A place where a fellow who has recently declared himself a bookseller, and only afterward realized that such a vocation has its own queer skills and knowledge, might blamelessly and invisibly acquire them, while appearing all the while to provide them from his own stock to a grateful public. But, even as the unworthy thought occurred to him, Julian was starting to believe in the idea for its own sake. Not that he was yet prepared to acknowledge that to Edward Avon. “You were sounding a bit like my father for a moment. I’m sorry. Go on.” “Not just the great novelists, who are obvious. But philosophers, freethinkers, founders of great movements, even those we may abhor. Chosen not by the dead hand of the ruling cultural bureaucracy, but by Lawndsley’s even Better Books. And called—” “Called what, for instance?” Julian demanded, off balance. Avon paused, the further to arouse his audience’s expectation: “We shall call it the Republic of Literature,” he declared, and sat back with his arms folded while he studied his man. And the truth was that, even if Julian had started out thinking this the most overblown sales pitch he had ever been subjected to, one that played with suspicious accuracy upon his sense of cultural deficit—not to mention an outrageous presumption on the part of a man whose bona fides he continued strenuously to question—nevertheless Edward Avon’s grand vision spoke straight to his heart, and to the reason he was here at all. Republic of Literature? He bought it. It rang bells. It was classy, but had universal appeal. Go for it. And he might have offered a more encouraging reply than his City man’s knee-jerk “Sounds pretty good, I’ll have to think about it,” had not Edward Avon already been on his feet, gathering up his homburg hat and fawn raincoat and umbrella on his way to the counter, where he now stood deep in conversation with the abundant Adrianna. But in what language were they conversing? To Julian’s ear it was the language of the announcer on the kitchen radio. Edward Avon spoke it; Adrianna laughed and spoke it back. Edward rallied and laughed along with her all the way to the door. Then he turned to Julian and gave him a last exhausted smile. “I am a little down at the moment. I trust you will forgive me. So good to meet HK’s son. Extraordinary.” “I didn’t notice anything. I thought you were great, actually. I mean about the Republic of Literature. I was thinking you might drop by and give me the odd bit of advice.” “I?” “Why not?” If a man knows his Sebald, is an academic of some sort, loves books and has time on his hands, why not indeed? “I’m opening a coffee bar above the shop,” Julian went on engagingly. “It’ll be ready next week with luck. Come in and graze, and we can have a talk.” “My dear fellow, what a generous offer. I shall give it my best endeavors.” With wings of white hair streaming from under his homburg, Edward Avon once more set off into the storm, while Julian headed for the cash desk. “You not like your omelet, my dear?” “Loved it. It was just a bit much. Tell me something, please. What language were you two speaking just now?” “With Edvard?” “Yes. With Edvard.” “Polish, my dear. Edvard is good Polish boy. You not know this?” No. He didn’t. “Sure. He very sad now. Got sick wife. She gonna die soon. You not know that?” “I’m new here,” he explained. “My Kiril is nurse. He work Ipswich General. He tell me. She don’t speak Edvard no more. She chuck him out.” “His wife chucked him out?” “Maybe she wanna die alone. Some peoples, they do that. They just wanna die, go to Heaven maybe.” “Is his wife Polish?” “No, my dear.” Hearty laugh. “She English lady”—laying a finger lengthways under her nose to indicate superiority. “You wanna take your change?” “It’s fine. It’s yours. Thank you. Great omelet.”  Safely back in his shop, Julian suffers a severe reaction. He had known a few con artists in his time, but, if Edward were another, he was in a class of his own. Was it conceivable, even, that he’d been hanging around in the downpour at eight o’clock this morning—just on the off chance that Julian would come out of the shop—then followed him to Adrianna’s café for the express purpose of putting the arm on him? Was Avon, by any chance, that huddled figure he’d spotted, sheltering under an umbrella in a doorway down the street? But what on earth was the endgame? And if the worst Avon wanted was company, didn’t Julian have a duty to provide it to his late father’s old school friend, and all the more so if his dying wife had chucked him out? And the clincher—how could Edward Avon or anyone else have known that Julian’s water and electricity had been turned off? Ashamed of his unworthy thoughts, Julian makes amends by haranguing a succession of errant tradesmen on the phone, then takes to his computer and visits the site of his late father’s West Country public school, currently mired in a child abuse investigation. He confirms that an Avon, Ted [sic], is on record as a “late entry scholar” to the school’s sixth form. Period of attendance: one year. He next embarks on a succession of abortive searches, first for plain Edward Avon, then for Edward Avon, academic, then for Edvard Avon, Polish speaker. He finds no plausible match. The local telephone listings offer no Avon of any kind. He tries an online address service: number withheld. At midday, builders appear unannounced and remain till mid-afternoon. Normal services are restored. Come evening, he leafs through his predecessor’s outstanding orders for rare and secondhand books, and chances on a dog-eared card marked Avon, no initial, no address, no number. The said Avon, male or female, is interested in any hardback work in decent condition by one Chomsky, N. Probably some obscure fellow Pole, he tells himself dismissively, and is about to toss the card away when he relents and searches for Chomsky, N.: Noam Chomsky, author of over one hundred books. Analytical philosopher, cognitive scientist, logician, public activist, critic of U.S.state capitalism and foreign policy, repeatedly jailed. Rated world’s top intellectual and father of modern linguists. Chastened, he retires to bed after the usual solitary supper in his resurrected kitchen and finds he is unable to think consistently about any subject other than Edward or Edvard Avon. So far, he reckons, he has met two irreconcilable versions of the man. He wonders how many more there are to come. Falling asleep at last, he speculates as to whether he has discovered in himself a secret need for another father figure. He decides that one has been quite enough, thank you. The week that follows Julian’s dual encounter with Edward Avon does not lack for distractions. A next-door neighbor’s underhand planning application threatens to rob the stockroom of its only source of daylight. Returning one evening from a conference of local librarians, he is met, not by Bella, but by a locked shop and a flowered thank-you card on the till, declaring her undying love for a Dutch fisherman. And in the precious basement, now firmly established in Julian’s mind as the future home of the Republic of Literature, rising damp is diagnosed. Yet, for all these calamities, he never ceases to reflect on the many faces of his late father’s school friend. Too often he fancies Edward’s raincoated shadow sweeping past the shop window without a turn of the homburg hat. So why doesn’t the wretched man come in and graze? No obligation to buy, Edward, Edvard, or whoever you are. The more he thinks about Edward’s grand plan, the more it grows on him. But does the name still ring right? Is it perhaps too high-hat after all? Might Readers’ Republic have greater crowd appeal? Might Republic of Readers, or New Republic of Readers, or how about Lawndsley’s Republic of Readers? Or how about just calling it Literary Republic? Telling no one—since there was no Edward to tell—Julian makes a dedicated journey to the print shop in Ipswich and has them run up a few tentative drafts for a full-page ad in the local rag. Edward’s first title is still the best. None of which in any way prevents him, in his low moments, from taking Edward to task for his intrusive theories regarding his father and himself: I defected from the City? Utter balls. I was a wide-awake predator from day one, and no kind of believer. I came, I stole, I conquered, I got out. End of story. As to my lamented father: maybe—just possibly—HK was some kind of religious defector. When you’ve screwed half the pious ladies of your parish, maybe you and God do decide to call it a day. And what about that heartwarming offer of friendship, money, and whatever else that Edward Avon had purportedly made to his old pal HK in the hour of his distress? All Julian could say was: Next time we meet, prove it. Because whatever else you might say about the Reverend H.K.Lawndsley (retired hurt), when it came to hoarding useless junk, he was in a class of his own. Nothing was too humble to be stored away for his future, nonexistent biographers: no sermon note, no unpaid bill or letter—be it from a discarded mistress, an outraged husband, tradesman, or bishop—escaped his egomaniacal net. And hidden here and there amid the mountain of dross, yes, the rare letter from a friend he’d managed to keep. And one or two of them did indeed offer assistance of a sort. But from his old school pal Edward, Edvard, Ted or Teddy, not a peep. And it is in part this inconsistency, coupled with a great impatience to get the Republic of Literature up and running once the rising damp was fixed, that prompts Julian to set aside whatever scruples he has, and call on his fellow toiler in the high street vineyard, Miss Celia Merridew of Celia’s Bygones, on the pretext of discussing a revival of the town’s defunct arts festival. She was waiting for him on her doorstep, feet astride, and sixty if a day, smoking a cigarillo in the unlikely sunshine. Her choice of costume was a kimono of parrot green and orange, her ample bosom adorned with strings of brilliant beads, her hennaed hair knotted in a bun and held in place by Japanese combs. “Not one penny, young Mr. Julian,” she warned him jovially as he advanced on her. And when he assured her that it was only her moral support he was after: “Wrong address, darling. No morals worth a bean. Come into my parlor and have a ginny.” A hand-scrawled notice on the glass front door read free cat neutering here. Her parlor was an ill-smelling back room of broken furniture, dusty clocks, and stuffed owls. From an ancient refrigerator, she extracted a silver teapot with the price label dangling from its handle, and poured a gin concoction into two Victorian rummers. Her hate-object of the day was the new supermarket. “They’ll do you in, and they’ll do me in,” she predicted in her rich Lancashire growl. “That’s all the buggers care about: putting us honest traders out of business. Soon as they spot you earning half a living, they’ll open an industrial-size book department, and won’t rest till you’re a charity shop. All right, let’s have it about your festival. I’ve heard about bumblebees that fly as shouldn’t. I’ve not heard about dead ones as can.” Julian made his pitch, by now a practiced performance. He was thinking of getting together an informal working party to explore options, he said. Might Celia agree to adorn it? “I’ll want my Bernard along to hold my hand,” she warned. Bernard, her consort: market gardener, Freemason, part-time estate agent, and chairman of the local council’s planning committee. Julian assured her that Bernard’s presence would be a boon. Random small talk while Celia gets the measure of him and he lets her. What about that Jones the greengrocer, then, standing for mayor when everybody except his wife knows he’s put his fancy lady in the family way? And those affordable houses they’re putting up behind the church, there: Whoever’s going to be able to afford one of them by the time the estate agents and lawyers have taken their cut? “So we’re a public schoolboy, are we, darling?” Celia asked, appreciatively running her sharp little eyes over him. “Went to Eton, I expect, same as the government.” No, Celia. State. “Well, you speak posh enough, I will say. Same as my Bernard. And I expect you’ve got yourself a nice girlfriend too, haven’t you?”—continuing her unabashed appraisal of him. Not at present, Celia, no. Resting, let’s say. “But the girls are what we like best, are they, darling?” Definitely what he liked best, he agreed—but he was careful all the same, as she leaned suggestively forward to top up his ginny, not to sound overenthusiastic. Which was Julian’s opportunity, by way of a couple of detours to confuse the scent, to arrive by supposed chance on the amusing topic of this oddball customer who’d barged into his shop at closing time, having had a drink or three, inspected it from top to bottom, kept Julian talking for half an hour, not bought a single book and turned out to be—he needed go no further: “That’s my Teddy, darling!” Celia cried in mock indignation. “Over the moon he was! Came straight in here to look it all up in the computer, bless him. Oh, but when he knew your dad had passed away—what with the troubles he’s got already—oh dear, oh dear,” she added, shaking her head in what Julian took to be a combined reference to his late father and Edward’s ailing wife. “My poor, poor Teddy,” she went on, as her beady eyes came back to inspect him yet again. And with barely a pause: “You’ve not had any dealings with him at all, have you, darling, while you were being a City mogul?” she inquired with elaborate innocence. “Direct or indirect, as we might say? Arm’s-length, as I believe they call it up there?” “Dealings? In the City? With Edward Avon? I only met him a few nights ago and bumped into him by accident at breakfast”—followed by the unpleasant afterthought—“Why? You’re not warning me off him, are you?” Ignoring his question, Celia went on scrutinizing him with shrewd eyes: “Only he’s a very good friend of mine, you see, darling, is Mr. Edward Avon,” she said with innuendo. “Like a special friend.” “Not prying, Celia,” Julian put in hastily, only again to be ignored. “Trust me?” “I’m asking.” “Well, that’s something for you to judge, Celia,” Julian said piously, confident by now that nothing was going to stop her. It was a very long story, she assured him: All of ten years now, since her Teddy first breezed through that door there one sunny morning with a carrier bag stuffed with tissue paper, pulled out a Chinese porcelain bowl, put it on the counter, and demanded to know what she reckoned it was worth on a good day. “Am I buying or selling, I say, because I don’t know him, do I? He walks in, he says, I’m Teddy, like he’s my best friend, and I’ve never seen him in my life. So what you’re asking for, I say, is a free valuation, which is not how I make my living, so it’s half of one per cent of whatever I say it’s worth. Come on, Celia, he says, don’t be like that. Just give me a ballpark figure. If I’m buying, I tell him, ten quid, and I’m being generous. Make it ten grand and it’s yours, he says. Then he shows me the valuation from Sotheby’s. Eight grand. Well, I didn’t know who he was, did I? He could have been any joker. Plus he’s a bit foreign. Plus I know bugger all about Ming blue-and-white. Anybody would have guessed that, just looking through the window. Who are you anyway? I say. Avon, he says, first name Edward. Well, I say. Not the Avon that’s married to Deborah Garton down at Silverview? The same, he says, but Teddy to you. Because he’s like that.” Julian needed to get his bearings. “Silverview, Celia?” Big dark house on the other side of town, darling. Halfway down the hill from the water tower, lovely garden, or was. Used to be called The Maples in the Colonel’s day, until Deborah inherited. Now it’s Silverview, don’t ask Celia why. And the Colonel was who? Julian asked, trying hard to imagine Edward in this unlikely setting. Deborah’s father, darling. Town benefactor, art collector, founder and patron of the town library, and hands all over you. My Bernard had a contract with him to supply and maintain his gardens. Deborah still has Bernard up there now and then. And it was the Colonel bequeathed her all his lovely blue-and-white porcelain, Celia went on with a grim sigh. A truly grande collection, she insisted, grande to rhyme with “horned.” “So when Teddy walked in on you that day, he was hoping to flog you a bit of family Ming on the side,” Julian suggested, only to see Celia’s mouth open and close again in horror. “Teddy? Bilk his own wife out of her inheritance? He wouldn’t ever, darling! He’s as straight as a die, is my Teddy, don’t ever let anyone tell you different!” Suitably chastened, Julian waited to be corrected. No, what Teddy would like to do in his retirement, Celia said, using the funds he’d earned after all those years teaching abroad in places you and me wouldn’t be seen dead in—Deborah being away on her quangos and whatever else she was up to—was to raise the quality of the Colonel’s grande collection to the absolute tops, partly by trading up, partly by acquisition. “Plus he’d like his Celia to be his intermediary, scout, purchasing agent, and representative on a highly private and confidential basis never to be revealed, with an annual floor commission of two thousand quid cash in hand for her trouble, and an agreed percentage of the annual turnover, in cash or kind, with nobody troubling the Inland Revenue, what does she think? Well, what would you think?” “All this in one short visit to your shop?” Julian exclaimed, privately recalling the eerie speed with which Edward had become prospective cofounder and consultant to the Republic of Literature, all in the space of a cheese omelet. “Three, darling,” she corrected him. “One the same afternoon, and then next morning, he’s got two grand in tenners in an envelope, he’d got them all ready for the moment I said yes, and there’s a piece for me each time he does a deal, him to decide how much—which I can’t object to, seeing he’ll be doing it all himself anyway behind the scenes.” And you said? “I said I’d have to ask my Bernard. Then I said—which I should have said before if I’d known him better—in heaven’s name, why come to me? Because you don’t sell top-class Chinese blue-and-white porcelain out of a toffee shop, do you? I said. Or buy it, I said. Plus the fact it’s all computers and eBay these days, and I haven’t even got a computer, let alone know how to work one. We’re Luddites, me and Bernard, proud of it, I said. Everybody in the town knows we’re Luddites. Didn’t bother him a bit. He knew it coming in, he said, he’d got it all worked out in his head. Celia, dear, he says to me, you don’t have to lift a finger beyond being who you are. I’ll be there for you every inch of the way. I’ll buy a computer. I’ll install it and handle it. I’ll locate the pieces to buy, and the pieces to trade. I’ll study the auction prices. All I ask, he said, is you do the talking, you be my front office under my guidance where needful because I like my life in the shadows, and that’ll be my retirement taken care of.” Celia purses her lips and takes a sip of ginny and a puff of cigarillo. “And you did all this, just the two of you?” Julian asked, bemused. “For ten years or whatever it was you said. Teddy trades, you take your retainer and your commission.” Julian’s bemusement was further compounded by the fact that Celia’s mood had blackened dramatically. For ten long years, ever since day one, everything had gone sweet as sugar. The computer duly arrived and was awarded its own little home—over there, darling, on the bow-fronted escritoire, not six feet from where you’re sitting. Edward would drop by whenever he felt like it, not every day by any means, sometimes not every week. He’d sit down in that chair there, with all his catalogues and trade rags, and he’d tap away and they’d have a ginny and Celia would take the calls and front for him. And every month, rain or shine, there’d be an envelope for her and she wouldn’t even count it, which was how much they trusted each other. And if Edward were away on business, which he sometimes was, there’d be the same envelope by registered post, and like as not a billy-doo saying he’d missed her beautiful eyes or something equally daft, because Teddy always knew how to pull out the stops, and he must have been a terror when he was young. “Away on what sort of business, Celia?” “International, darling. Education and similar. Edward’s an intellectual,” she replied loftily. Another sigh, a prudish tug at her neckline in case she was giving Julian ideas by mistake, as she approached the moment that ended her ten years in paradise. It’s Sunday night, a week ago. Eleven o’clock, the phone rings. Celia and Bernard have got their feet up, watching telly. Celia picks up the receiver. Her Deborah Avon voice is part Lancashire, part Her Majesty: “Is this Celia Merridew by enny chance? Yes, Deborah, I say, this is Celia. Well, Ay wish to inform you that Edward and Ay have decided to dispose of our collection of Chaynese blue-and-white porcelain forthwith. Dispose of it, Deborah? You don’t mean your grande collection? Yes, Celia, that’s exactly what Ay mean. We want it out of the house, preferably by tomorrow latest. All right, Deborah, I say. So where are we supposed to put it? Because you don’t shove a grande collection up against any old wall for the night, do you? Well, Celia, she says, seeing as how you’ve made yourself a small fortune out of Edward over the years, and since Edward assures me you have emple space, how about storing it in your beck area? “You store it in your back area, I thought—but I didn’t say it, did I, because of poor Teddy. Next afternoon, four o’clock by royal appointment, we’re up The Maples, all right, Silverview. Bernard’s got his tea chests and wood shavings; I’ve got my bubble wrap and tissue. Teddy’s waiting at the door, white as a sheet, and her ladyship’s upstairs in her boudoir with her classical music turned up loud.” Celia interrupted herself, but not for long: “All right, I know she’s ill. I’m sorry. I’m not saying it’s the greatest marriage ever because it’s not, but I wouldn’t wish what she’s got on my worst enemy. The whole house smells of it. You don’t even know what you’re smelling, except you do.” Julian acknowledged the sentiment, while Celia consoled herself with a sip of ginny. “So I say to Teddy, quietly, what’s all this about, Teddy? It’s not about anything at all, Celia, he says. Me and Deborah, in view of her tragic illness, we’ve decided to give up acquisition, and that’s all there is about it. Well. It’s past midnight by the time me and Bernard get it all back here into the shop, and all I’m thinking is, what about the insurance, with all the Romanians and Bulgarians roaming the countryside? Bernard makes himself a pile of blankets on the floor. I stretch out on that Victorian divan there. Midday, Teddy calls me up. He doesn’t like telephone as a rule. Our dealers will be arranging transportation directly, Celia. Deborah will be going for a private sale in due course of time, which is her good right. Kindly therefore inform me what I owe you for the removal and insurance. Teddy, I say, I’m not about the money, because I’m not. Just tell me what’s going on. Celia, he says, I told you already. We’ve given up acquisition, and that’s all that needs to be said.” Had she finished? It seemed so, and now she was waiting for him to speak. “So what does Bernard say?” he asked. “She needs the money for the doctors. I say bollocks to that. She’s got her father’s money, her private health, and who knows what else from her quangos. Plus she could buy half of Harley Street with her grande collection and have change left over,” Celia retorted contemptuously, stubbing out the last of her cigarillo. “So what do you say, clever Mr. Julian? Because if you’re the brilliant young gun I’m told you are, and seeing as our Teddy is your late father’s school friend, and is in total denial regarding his former close friend Celia owing to his wife’s unfortunate illness—and me having too much tact to trouble him at such an hour—perhaps some nugget of information will come your way”—very angry now, witness the sudden flush in her face, and the rise in her voice—“be it from Teddy himself, be it from one of your many City friends and admirers regarding the disposal of a certain unique collection of prime blue-and-white Chinese porcelain. Perhaps one of those Chinese millionaires we read about has snapped it up. Or one of your City syndicates. All I’m saying is”—the crescendo now—“I’ve not received one brass farthing on the sale, so if you’d kindly keep an ear out, I’d be very much obliged, young Mr. Julian, and I will show my appreciation in a businesslike manner, if you get my meaning. Blue-and-White Celia, they used to call me in the trade. They won’t be saying that anymore, will they? Not ever. Bugger! That’ll be Simon, come to buy my gold.” A cacophony of Swiss cowbells had announced Simon’s arrival. With improbable agility, Celia sprang to her feet, yanked the folds of her kimono over her hips, and straightened the Japanese combs in her hennaed hair. “Slip out the back way, will you, darling? I don’t believe in mixing my flavors,” she said, and set course for the shop. was the best-selling author of more than two dozen novels, and first wrote for Harper’s Magazine in 1965.

        "story": "In the small Southern town where Corinne has rented an apartment for the summer, she has found a yoga studio. It’s quainter than her usual one in Boston. At home, the women are lasered and sanded, the leggings sleek, the yoga competitive. To this place, which is above a tech-help center, people wear cargo shorts and baggy T-shirts. They pay by leaving cash or a personal check in a basket, register by signing a spiral notebook. They say oof as they bend. Corinne always unrolls her mat in the back corner, tries not to interlope. The archaeology professor is the only other woman in actual yoga pants. She can lift her leg by her ear. Her hair is long and red and curly. By eavesdropping, Corinne has learned that she teaches at the college, that her husband teaches chemistry there, but they’re divorcing. Corinne has questions. About whether tenure and the job market will mean this woman and her ex will continue living in this same small town the rest of their lives. Whether, when they begin dating again, they’ll each necessarily date people the other knows. There’s only one nice restaurant here, and Corinne can picture the scene: this woman waiting in the entry for her date, and meanwhile there’s the ex inside with his, leaning over a candle, his fork in her spaghetti. Corinne knows only a few things about this woman—it took a while even to catch her name—but she can conjure a full life for her: a book-lined apartment, wine with her friend the women’s studies chair, a cat, student trips every two years to Israel or Greece. Corinne can’t imagine as much about the women back in Boston who apply makeup before yoga, or about the women here whose clothes are stained from lawn mowing. (She acknowledges that this is snobbery, in both cases.) There’s something about the archaeology professor that has captured her attention, something that makes Corinne look for her in every class, makes her watch as she heads off in her Subaru. It’s by eavesdropping on this woman that Corinne learns about the town’s current scandal: the soccer goalie at the college, the visiting high school student he sexually assaulted, the sudden national spotlight. It’s also from eavesdropping that Corinne knows enrollment at the college is down, and the new president is unpopular, and there was racist graffiti in a dorm laundry room, but probably from a townie. The others in the class seem to use this woman as their pipeline for all university-related news. Mostly, they ask about the soccer goalie assault. She hears the professor say, “At least she came forward, and fast. So often, they just never come forward.” She sees the archaeology professor at the grocery store, the library, but the archaeology professor shows no sign of recognizing Corinne. Corinne wonders if she has a crush on the woman, but no: She has simply noticed her, and in a summer devoid of other entertainment, the professor has become a celebrity. Deities, royalty, actors—none of these are in Corinne’s world right now, and so a primal sliver of her brain has mythologized this woman, her Arthurian hair. In her short time here, Corinne has felt less and less like herself. She wakes in her rented basement apartment and nothing she sees is hers. She walks around town and no one is hers. There’s no mirror in the apartment, which at first was an inconvenience and now feels oddly liberating. She realizes she has seen the professor’s face, in the past weeks, more often than her own. She reaches up one day to adjust her ponytail and is surprised to find her hair thin and smooth rather than wild and curly. Something has shaken loose. Corinne would love to introduce herself, to have a friend in town, but even two weeks into her two-month stay, it’s too late. She’d have no patience for small talk when she’s already imagined so much of this woman’s life; and she has no desire, either, to detail her backstory, her whole existence. Here for research. The university archives. A nineteenth-century environmentalist; have you heard of him? No, it’s boring. Eight weeks. A private foundation, actually. Yes, two boys, they’re in camp. Yes, the mountains are lovely. the wife of the boy who raped her Back home, Corinne was never tempted to look the boy up. It crossed her mind occasionally, and each time she’d felt a wave first of revulsion—and then of pride in not needing to know. She’d thought of asking her husband to look him up. But her husband, after she told him years ago about the rape, has never brought it up, and she’s afraid that if she mentions it he’ll look at her blankly. That would be worse than anything. Here, though, there’s time and there’s emptiness and she has the urge to feel things. She starts by googling the goalie case, just out of curiosity, just to see the face of the kid everyone’s talking about. The assault happened a year and a half ago, but the trial is happening now. Before long she’s googled the man who was the boy and wound up on her small, hard bed staring at Elise’s photos. According to Facebook, this woman named Elise lives in Tampa with three children—two girls and a boy—plus the boy himself, who is now a man. His face has bloated, but just the face. Alcoholism? His account is either private or inactive, just a profile picture and a background photo of a sunset, and something about a fundraiser from five years ago. Hers, on the other hand, is a seemingly endless timeline: a decade of insipid daily life. Elise’s job seems corporate, the kind Corinne doesn’t care about. The boy is, of all things, a doctor, a podiatrist. His online reviews are mostly positive. As much as Corinne knows rape is rape is rape: if the rape had been a violent one, she’d already have contacted Elise. As things stand, she’s only thought about the shadow account she might create, the message she might send from there. One night, three weeks into her stay in the small town, she opens an empty Word document. She tells herself that she can write a note but not send it, that since she’s not seeing her shrink this summer she should do a cathartic thing. I knew your husband in college, she starts, but deletes that and begins again, talking only about herself. I’m a stranger, she starts, but I need to tell you a story. She writes about her college without naming it yet, writes about being five states from home. She won’t mention Kyle until she has won this woman’s sympathy. Eventually, she mentions the party, names the frat and the school. Someone had roofied the punch bowl, I learned later. Like in a bad movie. But probably not Kyle, who was a freshman and not yet a member of the house. For the most part, she tells it the way she remembers it, which is to say, not at all. My roommate saw us leave together. I was at the party, and then it was morning and I was naked in my bed, and everything hurt. My head, and also everything else. Elise runs half-marathons. This prejudices Corinne against her. Not because she disapproves, but because the kind of person who works a corporate job and runs half-marathons is not the kind of person Corinne knows. If Elise worked in the humanities, if Elise had posted photos of herself and friends with cocktails, if Elise posted political things, Corinne might feel some kinship. But it’s all race photos, and the whole family dressed for Easter in lavender and navy blue. Cursive quotations about how mothers are made of steel, about not letting worries get you down. There was cooked white rice all over the floor of my room. I never figured out why. If Corinne felt she and Elise were similar, she might send the letter with the best of intentions, in sisterhood. But part of her wants to reach out for the worst reasons: To cause this woman pain. To tear her marriage apart. To make her see that the world is a bad place and the man she married was a terrible boy, whether or not he’s a terrible man. Which is why she will never let herself reach out. My roommate said, “Don’t you dare touch her. She’s too drunk.” And later, when she met him in the hallway leaving our room, he said, “I didn’t follow your advice.” And he shrugged, my roommate said, and smiled and clucked his tongue. It’s important that you know he shrugged. She saves the file. Every few days, she goes in and looks at it, revises it. Just glancing at her closed computer, sleeping on her desk, gives her an adrenaline rush. her friend’s ex Her friend George once told her about a woman he dated in his twenties. The woman wanted to be pinned down every time they had sex. Not for part of the time—the whole time. He had to pretend to be assaulting her. If he kissed her or tried to make her feel good or let go of her arm, the moment was lost and she’d get up, put her underwear back on, start answering emails. The night he said all this, years ago, George had been overserved and was a little sloppy. Corinne has thought about it several times a week ever since, and not luridly but with genuine curiosity: What was it about this woman that made her own agency such a turnoff? She asked George, because she was drunk, too, if this had made him happy. “It made me happy to make her happy,” he said. “But ultimately, it was why we broke up.” When she asked what he meant, he flushed, sat up straighter, seemed suddenly aware that he was alone in a bar with a female friend, talking about sex. “I couldn’t live with that forever,” he said, “with only that, forever. Plus, like... it was hard work. Physically.” Then he changed the subject. A couple of times since then, Corinne has gone through George’s Facebook friends looking for the woman, whose name she never learned. She looks for women around George’s age, ones you’d never suspect it of. Or, well, the ones you actually would suspect it of, the women who run corporations, the senior partners at law firms. She looks for women who somehow match George, his dark curls, his always-startled eyes. And then she looks for women with hard faces, light hair: George’s polar opposite. When Corinne stands, she prefers to lean on a wall or to jut one hip out as far as her joints will go. She likes to feel limits, and she imagines this woman is the same. She thinks now of looking through George’s Facebook again, seeing who’s against a brick wall, who’s sitting with her legs double-crossed. She has a dream, one night in early July, that George introduces her to this woman, and it’s the archaeology professor. And Corinne says, “I should have known.” And the woman says, “You should have known.” the singer her husband keeps pictures of Back in the spring, she needed to get camp forms for the boys off Wallace’s computer. She clicked a file icon on his desktop and found the photos. She wasn’t sure who the woman was, but grew certain it was no one Wallace knew in real life, certain the pictures hadn’t been sent to him personally. Highly filtered shots, the woman’s caramel ass professionally lit. The woman sucked a lollipop, or licked her lips, or covered her nipples with two fingers of each hand. Corinne looked up the actress she thought it might be, but she was wrong. Two weeks later, the singer performed on Saturday Night Live, and Corinne recognized her. “Do you like her?” she asked Wallace. Wallace laughed. “She’s a bit much,” he said. Then he said, “I actually met her a few months ago. When we were doing the Fun Run thing.” Wallace was involved in organizing his company’s charity outing, a deal with minor celebrities. “Kind of a diva.” That night, Corinne checked when he’d saved the photos. Some right before the Fun Run, some right after, a bunch more six weeks later. Why he needed to save them, rather than simply whack off to Google results, Corinne couldn’t imagine. Well, maybe she could: A Google search would bring up the singer with her boyfriend, the singer as a baby, the singer caught on the street with no makeup. Wallace’s album was curated, flawless. The singer was always alone. Corinne was not concerned for a second that something had happened between the singer and Wallace. She almost wished she could imagine that. But instead, the whole thing made Wallace seem pathetic, a sad little man. She imagined him gazing at her from across the Fun Run tent, the singer in tiny shorts. She imagined him shaking her hand with a wet palm, asking if he could get her more water, close enough to smell what Corinne felt certain was vanilla-tinged perfume. She spent an hour that same night reading everything she could about the singer. The singer had been married three times, never longer than a year. The singer was a vegan who occasionally ate bacon. The singer was discovered at age twelve in a talent competition at Disneyland. Or maybe the prize was to perform at Disneyland. It wasn’t clear. In July, sitting on her bed in the basement apartment, she checks the singer’s Twitter account. Her tweets are predictably asinine. Believe it or not, one of them reads, I’ve always had a low self of steam. But you’re my champions! Corinne can think of nothing to do but to like the post in order to grant herself the satisfaction of then unliking it, of clicking the little heart to turn it from red to clear. the professor of archaeology, again One day in late July, in a forward fold, looking back between her own ankles, it occurs to Corinne that what fascinates her—actually, what fascinates her about her own fascination—is that she finds the archaeology professor neither beautiful nor ugly. This is rare. Her own internalized misogyny is such that she feels rage, conscious or subconscious, toward any woman she deems more beautiful than herself. She wants to see those women fail, wants them punished for their beauty. (With age, with ugliness, with stupidity.) And any woman less attractive than herself—older, boxier, more awkward, worse teeth—she feels pity for. An angry, vindictive pity. She’s simultaneously the wicked queen, wishing death on Snow White, and Snow White, revolted at the old hag. This judgment doesn’t usually occur in her rational brain—just in her guts. But she started, a few years ago, trying to recognize the stray flecks of her own racism, and now she’s trying to call out her misogyny too. She’s aware that there are men in the world, men with theories about females, who would call this cattiness, who would say it’s about evolution and competition. But good god, it’s not. She learned this rage from magazines, from TV, from her own mother. She learned to hate the female body, her own and all others, from a movie she watched, way too young, where nerdy college boys secretly film the girls who’ve rejected them. The boys were meant to be the heroes. She learned it from beer ads and music videos and ballet teachers and from a world where you were harassed on the street for looking good and harassed online for not looking good. It’s only strangers she judges this way. When she knows a woman, she sees her as human. But when she doesn’t, she slips so easily into seeing her the way the world does, which is to say the way men do, which is to say as an object. When a woman once was beautiful and now is not, but is still trying very hard to look young, that’s when her misogyny roars loudest. The women whose foreheads don’t move, the women still wrapping their aging bodies like sausages. That actress, her lips pumped and stretched till her face looks raw and vaginal. She hates them, wants to laugh at them, wants, when she googles them, to find worse and worse photos. Wants, eventually, worms crawling out of their eyeholes, their spackled lips to crack to blood. Not really. But on the deepest level. Corinne thinks all this while she’s still folded over. The archaeology professor, folded over too, tucks her hands neatly under the soles of her feet. the girl in the coffee shop Corinne does most of her work at the library, which holds, after all, the archives of the nineteenth-century environmentalist she came down here to research. But the air in the library is dry and cold, and the archives close at 4:30, and there’s a coffee shop in town with ratty leather couches, crust at the window edges. There’s a heat wave, but if she sits right in the stream of the small AC unit it’s fine. She should be indexing her research, or at least writing more grants, but instead she’s searching the boys’ camp news feed for photos that prove they’re alive, smiling, tanned. The girl wears a sweatshirt from the college volleyball team; she must have stayed here for a summer job. She sits with a boy who keeps grabbing her phone, going through her photos, asking Who’s this? Who’s that guy? He looks short. He looks like a short douchebag. What’s his name? Then he starts looking through her messages. The girl does that uncomfortable giggle, that involuntary laugh-spasm Corinne has tried so hard to train out of herself. “I’m deleting this guy,” he says. The girl says Stop! and she means it, but—maybe because she whines it, rather than screaming—the boy does not stop. Not that she should have to scream. The girl tries to grab her phone back. the high school student The high school student who was assaulted by the goalie has testified against him in court, and the world has noticed. Locally, it’s been in the papers for a while; but then Corinne was not a local until this summer. The girl’s face has not been shown, she has not been doxxed, but her testimony has been made public. The girl had not been drinking, but the boy and his friends had tricked her into eating four pot gummies. Maybe it was still a joke at that point: see what the high school student will do. She’d gotten woozy, gone upstairs in the frat house to lie down. She woke up with him on top of her, and said it was like one of those dreams where you wake halfway up and try to move, but your body, still asleep, won’t budge. You try to scream, and nothing comes out. The boy claims that he didn’t know she was a minor. He also claims it was consensual. There’s far more legal precedent in cases involving alcohol. Corinne watches the recap of the testimony at a small bar in town, a wood-paneled room where locals keep personalized steins on hooks. At 4 pm, she and an older couple clad in Harley-Davidson gear are the only ones in the place. She orders a glass of pinot grigio and wonders if it’s been poured from the same bottle as the last glass she had here, a week ago. According to the news, it came up in court that the girl “had shaved her pubic area” before the party. The male defense attorney grilled her about why she would do that if she hadn’t gone to the party wanting and expecting sex. The female news anchor reads snippets of the transcript with barely concealed rage. The defense attorney asked if the girl was on birth control. He asked if she’d taken a pill the very day of the party. Corinne wants to smash the TV. The female half of the Harley couple shakes her head, says, “Well there you go, right there. There you go.” the wife of the man she’s sleeping with Childishly, Corinne hates her. She hates her long black hair, her long neck, her beautiful friends always leaning on her in photos. She was the first of Corinne’s online wormholes. The woman’s social pages; the website for her practice; her wedding announcement, now ten years old. She hadn’t searched for her in quite a while, but one day in the archive room early in August, tired of the boxes of cursive correspondence (the summer is messing up her back, messing up her eyes), Corinne opens her computer and first looks again at the hypothetical email to Elise. I’m a stranger. I need to tell you a story. She googles Elise, to see what else she can find. She’s still wearing her white gloves when she keys the letters in. Lots of mentions on official race pages. Times that mean nothing to Corinne. A LinkedIn profile she can’t see for free. And because she’s already down the internet hatch, and because Elise’s life is not that interesting, she ends up googling the wife. She’s a dermatologist. The kind that injects fillers, not the kind that treats melanoma. When Corinne is with George, or when she texts him, she will not use the woman’s name. “Your wife,” she calls her. She does not want George to leave his wife, because then what would she do with him? Not marry him. Not leave her husband. It would be too much work. George would be too much work. Everything is too much work. They didn’t get together the night that George told her about his ex, the one who needed to be restrained. But the intimacy of the conversation had surely sparked something. It happened a month later, when he drove her home from a party that Wallace had left early, claiming a headache. That was three years ago. A logic problem: She is jealous of the wife, because the wife has George. But (and she’s aware of the hypocrisy) she does not wish she were married to George, because George is the kind of guy who would cheat on his wife. (Wallace, for all his failings, would never, could never, actually make the moves that would get him there.) Ergo, she feels sorry for the wife, because the wife is married to a guy she doesn’t even really know. But the wife is happy, or at least seems happy. This happiness is wrong. Whereas Corinne, who knows the truth, and for a while there had George every Tuesday afternoon at least, is not particularly happy at all. The question is: What the hell. George has a habit of breaking her heart. As soon as Corinne starts to rely on him, or starts to admit to herself that she’s in love, George needs space. Or he simply vanishes. As soon as her heart grows another defensive layer, he’s back. Corinne thought that getting here, getting away from him for two months, would bring her back to herself. Or, no: By August, she realizes that what she really wanted, all along, was for him to come after her. To show up at the doorstep of her basement apartment, to spend a night, two nights, a week. He texts her like her husband does, anodyne things: Tell me something good.Hope you’re having a good day.Yes, all great here. She wanted distance, but she didn’t want this. When she’s angry with George, which is frequently, she thinks that one day she’ll write the wife an anonymous letter, on actual paper, and mail it from another city. She’ll tell, not about herself, but about the woman George slept with at work, the woman he saw for a while a few years ago, the friend of the wife’s whom he kissed, drunk, at a party in his own house. Just get yourself tested, she’ll write. I say this in friendship. Of course that part will not be true. That summer, at the bottom of an old document full of useless research, she drafts this note too, an addition to her collection of notes she’ll never send. Here is the wife’s website: Botox, Restylane, Juvéderm, dermaplaning. Here she is, not exceptionally beautiful, but her face has a sheen, and her lips are full, and unless the photo has been retouched, the skin on her neck isn’t doing the horrifying things Corinne’s is. Corinne knows plenty of things about the wife, many of them unflattering. She knows that the wife takes five-hour baths, that she eats salad with her fingers, leaf by leaf, that the wife, a virgin at twenty-three when she and George met, had had a misunderstanding of the term blowjob. Corinne’s shrink says her hatred of the wife is misplaced self-hatred, sublimated guilt. Corinne doesn’t disagree. Corinne has declined her therapist’s offer of phone sessions over the summer, and it’s probably a bad idea, but strangely, Corinne has found herself articulating things more clearly in her own head. Without a shrink to save it all up for, she has to think each thought all the way through on her own. She looks up pricing for some of the services the wife offers. Eight hundred dollars for fillers that last six months. Five hundred dollars for a laser treatment. The before and after pictures are impressive, if they’re real. Faces smoothed as if ironed, skin brightened until it looks—well, burned, yes, but also younger. Before, after. Before, after. Before, after. Corinne could click all day. Back in April, George told Corinne that he and his wife would be at a protest in front of the federal building in Boston. Corinne told him she was planning to be there herself, although it wasn’t true till that moment. It was a small enough protest that when she showed up, she spotted them easily. George held his young son on his shoulders. The wife seemed to know half the people there. This was when Corinne knew she needed to get out of town. She didn’t recognize herself, this crazed woman in the crowd. Even now, she’s not sure what she was there for. Certainly not to say something. That’s a fantasy she’d never act on. She supposes she was there to observe, to gather information. Not for any use, but to scratch some kind of itch. To think to herself: This is her. This is the way she moves. This is how her voice sounds, louder than you’d think. This is how she walks through the world. Look at her beautiful shoes. the girl in the coffee shop, again The young couple is back, and Corinne watches them study side by side. The girl gets up to head to the restroom, and the boy says, “Leave your phone here.” “What? Why?” “So I know you aren’t sexting anyone.” The girl says, “You’re ridiculous.” “Why would you need your phone in the bathroom?” She says, “I’ll leave it here, but I’m locking it.” “Why would you need to lock it?” The girl throws her phone at the boy, and he puts it facedown in front of him. Corinne writes a note on a library slip from her purse, and waits outside the bathroom door. That kid is an ass, the note says. This is how the bad stuff starts. When the girl emerges, she hands her the note. She worries the girl will show the note to the boy, that they’ll both laugh at her, but she takes a moment before entering the bathroom herself, and when she glances back, the girl is stuffing the note in her pocket. Corinne is proud of herself for a few hours, and then wonders why she didn’t say something aloud, didn’t confront this boy. She likes to believe that if she’d seen, for instance, one kid telling another to go back to Pakistan, she’d have intervened at full volume. She’d have made a scene. But for women, no: whispers, notes. the daughter of the boy who raped her As the summer progresses, as the apartment accumulates layers of junk, Corinne spends more time inside her computer. She clicks back and forth between Twitter and Facebook, waiting for something interesting to happen. She digs through emails she failed to answer last year. One night, she dreams she has tricked her husband by filling a piñata with all their wedding china, then asking him to smash it. It’s his birthday party, and when the piñata falls to the ground, when the shards of china spill out, he looks utterly betrayed. In the dream, Corinne laughs; but when she wakes up, her stomach roils with acid. She numbs herself by lying in bed and staring at her phone, and for some reason this is the morning she thinks to try the boy’s last name, an unusual one, on Instagram. He isn’t there, and his wife isn’t there, but here’s his oldest daughter, who looks about fourteen, too young to have a public account like this, too young to post these photos of herself in a bikini. Corinne wonders if her mother knows, wonders if she should screenshot the account and send it, anonymously, to Elise. But no, no, no, no. How is it possible that she’s thinking of ratting out a teenage girl for showing skin, but not the father for committing rape? Well. She knows how it’s possible. the wife of the nineteenth-century environmentalist Her name was Mae, and she pops up often in Corinne’s research, although this is not what she’s there to learn, not what her grant is for. Mae was, herself, an herbalist. Mae’s maid, Annunziata, an Italian immigrant, was arrested in 1892 after her husband died from ingesting the oil of bitter almonds, which Annunziata had given him as medicine. Annunziata claimed she’d thought it was the oil of sweet almonds, a harmless drug, that she’d miscommunicated with the druggist in her imperfect English, that the druggist was the one who should be tried. The story upsets Corinne, particularly the version of it in which Annunziata loved her husband and unknowingly gave him something deadly. The better version: he was an abusive man, and Mae told Annunziata what to do. What other justice was available, in that shadowy time? What justice is ever on offer? Annunziata remained in the household through old age. the news anchor She’s seething, talking about how the judge has handed the goalie only a three-month sentence. Three months in the county jail, two years of probation. This is not an opinion show, this is a newscast, and she is meant to report the news. Corinne guesses she has opinions and information about pubic hair, about birth control pills, about incapacitation, about the male defense attorney, the male judge. Corinne likes this anchor. A local anchor, one she’s known only since she came down here. Corinne remembers someone telling her that since anchors have to buy their own clothes, the women nearly go broke buying bright jacket after jewel-tone blouse. They can never repeat an outfit. The men just cycle the same five jackets and shirts. The boy has been expelled from the college, but people have raised money online to “help him land on his feet.” Corinne watches the anchor clench and unclench her left hand, her nails perfectly manicured and pink. The nails cost money, too. the archaeology professor, again Corinne spots her at the farmers market that sets up every Saturday morning at the entrance of the town’s small botanical garden. Corinne is not there to shop—her apartment has only the tiniest stove, so what would she do with onions and collards and baby potatoes?—but when she spies the professor, her arms laden with canvas bags, Corinne sticks around and buys some flowers. The professor is looking at zucchini, she’s taking a sample of cheese. The seam rips on one of her bags, and smaller paper bags fall out of it, onto the sidewalk. Blueberries roll. Corinne wants to help, but she’s stuck to the spot. The professor is down on her knees, scooping everything back up, looking like she wants to cry. Corinne has never seen her not serene, never seen her not look fundamentally yogic. She looks, right now, like this is the fifteenth such thing to happen to her today, like she’s a centimeter away from utter disaster and despair. Corinne resolves that the next time she’s at the yoga studio, she’ll secretly pay for the professor’s next class pack. But then, on Monday at the studio, she’s suddenly too shy to approach the desk with this strange request. Surely everyone here knows the professor. And no one knows her. And so she does nothing. But she thought it, and for a while the thought makes her feel good. the women in the bondage films It’s the only porn Corinne wants to watch now. Women tied up, enjoying it against their will. Devices, whips, multiple men, strange rope configurations, gags. She needs to believe the films were ethically made, needs to believe that if one of these women were ever in true distress, she’d know it, she’d see it in her face. (And then what would she do? Call the police? This one woman in porn looks really sad.) She wants no men to watch these videos, ever. She wants no teenage boys to think this is how it works. She does not, of course, want to be grabbed off the streets and put in a dungeon and given rope burns. She does not want to be the women in the videos, and she does not want to be the men in the videos, nor does she want to be another woman in the videos, doing things to the tied-up woman. She wants to be here, on her bed, watching the videos. She wishes these websites could collect statistics on gender, on who watches what. Maybe they do, who knows. She wishes she could switch research fields and compile the data. She’d give people optional exit surveys, after they logged off porn sites. No personal information beyond gender and age, just Did you feel weird about this? Did you like this? Did you hate that woman? Did you love her? What she does, in the real world, is send the links to George. She’s sent him stuff before, but not like this. She’ll be home in ten days, and she’s fairly sure her absence has broken whatever they had. When they see each other, it will be awkward, formal. Not a mad embrace. Wasn’t that the point, though? He texts back: Is this what you want? She writes back: No. Then she writes: I think I want to be the whip. the self-care expert Corinne is in the coffee shop again, and the frumpy woman in the next seat is watching a video, a talking-head thing, on her laptop with no earphones. Back home, Corinne would complain, but here she’s constantly aware that she’s a stranger, one with a Yankee accent. And she’s not getting work done anyway. The woman in the video is a self-care expert, and she’s talking about compartmentalization. “We can’t absorb all the bad news,” the woman says, “for all the people in the world.” The woman’s blazer is pale yellow, and she’s eerily calm, her voice a skating rink. Corinne thinks this is the worst idea she’s ever heard, this excuse for caring only about yourself and your family and people who remind you of your family. The woman recommends visualizing your mind as a series of jars with lids. She recommends dropping romantic concerns in one jar, financial concerns in another, mentally screwing on the lids. Corinne wonders if this is what has broken down for her, this summer: she has lost her compartments. Back home, chasing after kids, working, eating dinner with Wallace, meeting up with George, using her computer only for research, keeping her house organized, keeping her office organized—everything was in its place. Here, her world has become as disordered as her rented room. Everything that’s ever happened to her, everyone she’s ever known, is right there in her laptop, waiting for her to shake the mouse and bring it all to life. She’s been absorbed in her neighbor’s video for so long that she hasn’t noticed the college couple, the girl and her terrible boyfriend, entering the coffee shop. They stand in line, looking through the grimy glass at the giant pastries. They’re holding hands. Corinne stuffs her laptop and papers in her bag, scurries out the door before the girl sees her—unless she already has, unless this hand-holding is a demonstration for her benefit. Instead of heading to the bar for a drink, and even though she has half an open bottle at home, she buys a bottle of red wine and carries it home in her bag, where it clanks against her computer. At home, a cockroach skitters out from under the closet door, big as a mouse. Corinne manages not to scream; she flaps her hands against her legs instead, turns in a circle. She stomps her foot, but the cockroach is already gone. the high school senior Corinne has finished her open bottle and started the new one. She doesn’t remember following the singer Wallace is obsessed with, but apparently she has. Here she is, in a black strappy halter that looks like someone went at her with a roll of duct tape. She has actual tape on her mouth, a black X. She’s written: standing tall with victims of silence. What the hell is a victim of silence? In the tweet below that—Corinne has a moment of cognitive dissonance as she digests that the singer is writing about the small town Corinne is now drinking in—she’s posted an article about the rape case. The girl’s victim impact statement, but not her name, has been released. Corinne reads the statement, and it’s good. Corinne had somehow missed the fact that after the assault during her campus visit, the girl chose to come to school here anyway, spent the past year as a freshman. She thinks of the coffee shop girl, wonders if they know each other, if they’ve debated each other in class. The fact that she’d enrolled at the university was used against her. It was the best school that accepted me, the girl wrote, maybe because she knew she needed to justify it. They offered me the best scholarship package. The girl—no, the young woman, because she’s in college now, and college was when Corinne, at least, started calling herself a woman—chose to attend the university, and it wasn’t until she saw her rapist on campus that she fell apart. This was when she sought counseling, articulated what had happened, brought charges. Corinne finds a tweet questioning the woman’s decision, if she was really so traumatized, to matriculate at the university. As opposed, Corinne writes in response, to at a rapist-free school? the woman in the picture Corinne wakes up with a construction site in her skull, her mouth bitter, the lights too bright. She finished the second bottle; she never ate dinner. She’s always remembered a recovering alcoholic who came to speak to her high school who said “I knew I had a problem when I started drinking alone. There’s never a reason to drink alone.” But he was a man. He didn’t understand that for women, drinking alone was safer. Drinking in a group was the dangerous thing. Except that with your phone in your hand, your computer next to you on your bed, you were never really alone anymore, and it slowly comes to Corinne that what she did was not a dream, it’s an actual memory, as thick and acrid as whatever’s coating her tongue. But she—what did she do? She did it backwards. She did it backwards on purpose, in some kind of drunken logic that might actually save her, or, no, save them, which wasn’t the point but suddenly felt like it. As long as she’d remembered to use a fake account. She pulls the computer into the bathroom and sits on the floor near the toilet and checks, her fingers shaking from the alcohol, and maybe from nerves too. Yes, she finds she’s still logged in to the burner account she uses to register for free seats to rallies for horrible politicians, so that those seats stay empty. On more than one occasion, she’s marveled at her ability to write lucidly, or at least to edit cleanly, when drunk. And here, look: Without typos, with the names changed, she’s taken the note she’d written about George, his other affairs, and sent it to Elise, the wife of the boy who raped her, to the email account listed on her Facebook. She’s subbed in the boy’s place of work and his occupation (at a medical convention, she wrote, because yes, indeed, the boy is now a doctor, one whose patients seem to love him); she remembers, now, going back to the boy’s own Facebook page and finding the name of an attractive female friend he had tagged himself with at a party, and here is her name in the email (You might want to ask Debra Wenman a few questions). It should all be easily disproven. Debra Wenman might be a lesbian, might be dead, might be his cousin. The boy will, unless he’s guilty of these things, be able to plead innocence with all the conviction of actual innocence. He could take a lie-detector test. But why is she so worried about him? What she accused him of is far less terrible than what he actually did, just more recent. She’s accused the man of it, is the thing, and not the boy. For a horrible moment, it crosses her mind that she sent George’s wife the note she’d composed for Elise, that she accused George of college-era rape. But no, there’s no such email in her sent box. She checks her phone to see if she texted George, but the last message between them is still the upside-down smiley face he sent her two days ago, and she hasn’t written back. It’s the only time she feels okay: when she’s the one silent, when he’s the one waiting. It’s not lost on her that she did this drunk, and that what the boy did to her, twenty years ago, he also did drunk. A few years back, when another college rape was in the news, her friend Suzanne (no longer her friend) said the boy couldn’t be blamed for what he did intoxicated. Drinking, Corinne argued, didn’t make you act out of character. Normal people didn’t murder their wives when they were drunk; spousal abusers did that. You didn’t profess love to someone when you were drunk unless you actually loved them. “I don’t rape people when I’m drunk,” Corinne said, “no matter how attracted to them I am. Because I’m not a rapist.” But what does it make her, that in her stupor she sent this email that was a lie, that would do nothing but hurt people? It occurs to her that maybe, after the dust clears, it will bring him closer to Elise. After all, someone must be jealous of one of them, to send this note. Someone wants them split up, and what’s more romantic than that? Corinne vomits three times. She drinks water, and throws that up too. She wonders if the panicked regret she feels over the email is part of the generalized regret she always feels when she’s hungover, the self-loathing that wants to be purged just as much as the alcohol does. Her empty stomach, so profoundly empty, feels flat for once. When she makes it back to the bed, she peels her shirt off, holds her phone up high, takes a picture of her bare torso, her chest, her neck, her face. Her face looks horrid and pale, but she fixes it with filters. She never sends George a picture that includes both her body and her face, always only one or the other, just in case, but she’s feeling reckless and self-obliterating, and she sends it. She waits to hear back, but he doesn’t respond and she falls asleep, and when she wakes again two hours have passed and he hasn’t written. She hates being the last one to hit send, hates the limbo it puts her in, wishes she could take the photo back. Before she deletes it from her phone, she stares at the picture. She looks like a corpse, her eyes closed, her body still and stiff on the white sheets. She needs her boys back from camp. She needs to be in her own house. How easy it turns out to be, to come unmoored. the archaeology professor It’s Corinne’s final yoga class here. The apartment is half packed, and she’s written a thank-you note to the library archivist. She wishes she could stay in this room, on this mat, forever. She’s happiest when her body is pretzeled, her legs wound together, her arms wound together, or her arm pressed tight against her thigh, or her feet clenched in her hands, or her hands clasped behind her back. She needs to feel the limits of her body, and the hardness of the floor beneath her mat. She takes time gathering her things after class, puts her blocks and strap away slowly. The archaeology professor is talking to the instructor. Corinne must have been standing closer than she realized; when the professor turns, she seems startled by Corinne’s face right there in her own. What Corinne wants to say, and almost starts to say, as if dreaming and not in control of what comes next, is “I messed up, and I need you to forgive me.” But because she is not dreaming, because she is standing here in her bare feet on the cold wood floor, what she says is “You dropped this.” And then she can’t think what on earth she means, and the professor and the yoga instructor both look at her expectantly. But Corinne’s hand is in her sweatshirt pocket, and in this same pocket is the twenty dollars she’d been meaning to put in the class payment basket. She hands the rolled-up bill to the professor. “Oh!” the professor says, and her eyebrows go skeptical. “I did?” “You did,” Corinne says, and then she leaves before there can be another question. Tomorrow she’ll slip in the door and put another twenty in the basket. No, she’ll put fifty. That seems right. Or fifty and a note of thanks.

She eats a salad by herself. After lunch, she carefully brushes her teeth with a dry brush, looking in a little mirror. Somehow, it is not at all disgusting. She reapplies red lipstick.

        "story": "For years, people asked Rochelle: What were you thinking? Everybody wanted to know. Strangers would cross the street to cut her off on the sidewalk. Hey, they would say. Tell me one thing. She had put the girls down after lunch and tried to catch a nap herself, but every time she started to doze off, the sirens. You’d think they’d blow the sirens only after somebody had actually seen a tornado, but no. They’d been going off all morning. She didn’t know how the girls slept through it. They were almost out of milk. They only had enough for one cup and both girls would want some. The IGA was just up the street. You could almost see it from the house. There and back, five minutes flat, ten tops, if somebody in the line had a cartful. The girls were sleeping so peacefully! She locked the door and shook the handle and stuck her fingers in her ears and ran for the car. It was tornado weather: too hot, too humid, too still, the air singed with ozone. Low, black clouds roiling by, a movie running too fast, but not a breath of air stirring on the ground. Streetlights on at lunchtime. But it was Alabama in April. When was it not tornado weather? The IGA parking lot was empty. Mr.Chandaluri was holding the door open. Rochelle pulled her fingers out of her ears and yanked the chain on her brightest smile. Her mama always said, Smile whenever somebody does something nice for you. Then they’ll want to do it again. But the sirens! The wailing chopped through her head and circled away and came back around and chopped through her head again. It was hard to look pleasant. “Come inside,” he said. She said, “Why, thank you, Mr.Chandaluri.” “In,” he said. “Now.” That’s when she saw the keys hanging from the door. She stopped. Why was Mr.Chandaluri trying to lock her inside the IGA? She said, “We ran out of milk.” He said “Look” and pointed across the parking lot. A hive of queasy, green clouds hunkered over downtown. As they watched, a crooked finger of smoke wobbled to the ground and began to scratch among the buildings. A flock of shingles flushed from the roof of the insurance office and spun away into the air. A telephone pole leaned slowly forward, an old man picking up a penny off the floor, the wires pulling tight, before toppling over with a white flash and a boom. The lights in the IGA went off. The streetlights. The sirens. Mr.Chandaluri grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her into the store. “Run,” he said. “Aisle one. Straight back. The freezer.” She heard keys jangling, the thunk of the lock, her flip-flops slapping the floor. A glow, a window, a door, a broom-handle slice of light across a tar-black room, the freezer, the cold, Mrs. Chandaluri squatting with a flashlight. “Anil?” she asked. “He’s right behind me,” Rochelle said. And then Mr.Chandaluri was kneeling beside Mrs. Chandaluri. “Oh, Mother,” he said. “It’s coming.” Mrs. Chandaluri pointed the flashlight at Rochelle. “Mrs. Taggert,” she said. “Where are your babies?” Tina woke up first. She made sure Tania was still asleep, then tiptoed out of their room and ran down the hallway and climbed into bed with their mother. Rochelle said, “You can stay here as long as your sister doesn’t wake up.” Tina thought Don’t wake up and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, Rochelle was gone. She wandered down the hallway to the kitchen and around the island into the living room. She circled the coffee table and went back through the kitchen and opened the basement door a crack to see whether the light was on downstairs and pushed it closed again. She peeked inside the bathroom. She looked behind the shower curtain. She went back to Rochelle’s room and checked the closet and under the bed. When she poked Tania on the shoulder, Tania frowned without opening her eyes and said, “Don’t wake me up.” Tina said, “Mommy’s not here.” They searched Rochelle’s bedroom, the bathroom, the kitchen. Tania cracked open the basement door and closed it again. In the living room they looked out the picture window. The streetlights were on. Tania said, “Her car’s gone.” “Where did she go?” Tina asked. Dogs all over town were howling along with the sirens. Tania said, “We should turn on the TV.” They sat down on the rug and Tania aimed the remote at the television. Dave Dimon looked straight at them and said, “Dana, Alabama. You’re under the gun. If you can see me, if you can hear the sound of my voice, you should already be in your place of safety. If you have a basement, get in it right now.” Run: kitchen, basement door, down, down the rickety stairs, dark and damp and dirt and Tide. Tania jumped and jumped and finally snagged the light cord. Tina spun around and around beneath the bulb, because what were they supposed to do in the basement? Tania pointed at the narrow space between the washer and dryer and said, “Let’s hide in there.” Tina said, “I don’t want to hide in there.” Good spiders and bad spiders lived in the basement and she couldn’t tell them apart. Both kinds definitely lived under the washer and dryer. Tania said, “But it’s a tornado.” Tina wasn’t sure what a tornado was, but she thought it had something to do with a train. She said, “I want Mommy.” Tania sat down and grabbed Tina’s arm and tugged her to the floor. Tina said, “Stop.” Tania scooted back into the gap and said, “We have to get in.” Tina said “No!” but scooted backward until she bumped up against Tania’s feet. She said, “I’m telling.” The light went out. A ghost floated down the street and turned into a lion. The lion jumped on the roof of the house and roared and clawed at the shingles and shattered the windows. It picked up the house and looked underneath it and sucked in a breath and roared so loudly that Tina felt her hair lifting away from her head. She saw daylight. Mud and leaves and grass. Tania screamed in her ear. She thought Put it back down and covered her head with her arms. And they asked Rochelle: What did it sound like? Well, not like a train. Not like everybody says. Then it got so quiet she could hear Mr.Chandaluri’s nose whistling. He said, “Mother, I think it’s gone by.” Mrs. Chandaluri said, “Mrs. Taggert?” Rochelle said, “They were asleep.” Mrs. Chandaluri said, “Anil, open the door.” She stood beside her car with her keys in her hand and watched Mr.Chandaluri run down the street and duck under a sagging power line and wade into the canopy of a fallen tree and disappear. Mrs. Chandaluri said, “Run, Mrs. Taggert,” and pulled her sari halfway up her calves and jogged after Mr.Chandaluri. The house was a trash heap, a burn pile, garbage slung into a ditch by rednecks too lazy to drive to the dumpster. Jagged nests of wood and siding, shredded shingles and clots of pink insulation, magazines and sofa cushions and yellow plastic plates. The Goodwill treadmill, the blue cooler, her good sundress, the shower curtain, the grocery bag stuffed with other grocery bags, a twist of pink bedsheet; everything she owned. Mr.Chandaluri had managed to climb on top of the pile where the kitchen used to be. He stood with one foot on a piece of the roof and the other on top of the refrigerator. He clasped his hand to his forehead, a sad explorer who had climbed the wrong mountain, then leaned over and closed the freezer door. Oh, no, no, no. Mrs. Chandaluri was down on her hands and knees near the front steps, speaking into a foundation vent. “Little girls!” she called. “Little girls! Are you there?” They stopped crying when they heard Mrs. Chandaluri. One day in line at the IGA, Tania had picked up a Twix from the candy display and showed it to Tina. Mrs. Chandaluri saw her and said something very fast to Mr. Chandaluri that sounded like words and not like words. Like rain on the car roof. Popcorn popping. Marbles spilling on a tabletop. They were amazed. Mr.Chandaluri said, “Would you like to have that?” Rochelle turned around and said, “Tania, put it back.” Mrs. Chandaluri said something else to Mr.Chandaluri. He looked down at Tina and smiled. “And how about you? Would you like a Twix, too?” he asked. Rochelle said, “Thank you so much, Mr.Chandaluri, but we can pay for it.” “Next time,” Mr.Chandaluri said. “Are you sure?” “I’m sure.” Rochelle said, “What do you say, girls?” After they got in the car Tania asked, “What did Mrs. Chandaluri say to Mr.Chandaluri?” Rochelle said, “You made her very angry. She said, ‘Little girls in the checkout line should keep their hands to themselves.’” Underneath the house, Tania whispered, “It’s Mrs. Chandaluri.” “Where’s Mommy?” Tina whispered back. “Little girls, don’t be afraid. Please answer if you are there,” Mrs.Chandaluri said. It sounded like she was right on top of them. “Don’t say anything,” Tania said. Tina said, “I want to get out.” Somewhere outside, Rochelle began to scream. “Tania! Tania Taggert! Can you hear me?” Tina closed her eyes and yelled “Mommy!” so loudly her ears popped. “They are here!” Mrs. Chandaluri shouted. “Mrs. Taggert! Your babies are here! Anil! Get down from there before you break your neck and be useful and go find help. The children are under the house!” Starting in middle school, they played a game they called You’re the One. Tania might say “You’re the tall one,” and Tina would answer “You’re the short one,” which was true. Easy enough. Tania might say “You’re the brunette one,” and Tina would say “You’re the blond one,” which was also true, although annoying to have to acknowledge, because Tania was vain about her hair. It never ended well. Tania never knew when to stop, and Tina was too competitive to give up. If Tania said “You’re the smart one,” Tina knew she was supposed to say “No, you’re the smart one,” but refused to because it wasn’t true, not by a long shot, or “You’re the dumb one,” which, while kind of true, always started a fight. And if Tania said something really dumb, like “You’re the one God wanted to live,” Tina sounded like a loser no matter how she answered. You’re the One was like tic-tac-toe: unless you went first, the best you could hope for was a tie. Once they got older, Tina knew for a fact, from friends who had brothers or sisters in Tania’s grade, that Tania regularly bragged about having saved Tina’s life. Poor little four-year-old Tina, who hadn’t known what a tornado was. So, if Tina made honor roll, she owed it to Tania. If she hit two home runs in the playoffs against Guntersville, she owed it to Tania. Sure, it was Tania who had turned on the television, but it was Dave Dimon who told them to go to the basement. It was Tania who thought to hide between the washer and dryer, but—and this was the most important part, but also the part nobody ever considered—it was Tina who had woken Tania up. If I don’t wake up, you don’t wake up. You saved me, but I saved you first. I’m the one. After two years of trying, Dave Dimon had finally talked the station into getting Doppler radar. Two other local stations had it. Huntsville had it. Montgomery was getting it. Opelika was dreaming about it. It was time. That was in January. February was quiet, just wet, just February. Not much shaking in March, either, a couple of middling cold fronts pushing squall lines, moderate straight-line winds, the usual, a few watches but no big deal, not enough shear aloft for anything substantive to get properly organized. Stuff to look at, in other words, but not much to see. Dave, you still got that grease pencil? Then came the tenth of April. That morning, a handful of LP supercells fired up along the dryline in southern Mississippi and moved north-northeast but didn’t amount to much, lot of lightning, lot of noise, big deal, so what, welcome to the Southland in springtime. Except for the Dana storm. Around two o’clock, that one grew a hook echo off the southwestern quadrant. Classic tornado signature: a quotation mark, a seahorse, a crawdad tail, textbook debris ball, the whole deal, would you just look at that. Dave, the weather service just warned it, clear the set, everybody, sorry Bill Dance, we’re cutting in, going live in three, two, one... Worth every penny. Doppler saves lives, folks. That’s the bottom line. End of story. Once, when they were in high school, who knows what they had been fighting about—you used my hairbrush, no I didn’t, Mom! make her get off the phone—Tania slammed her door in Tina’s face. Tina found herself staring at the picture of Dave Dimon her sister kept taped to the door. to my old friend tania on her sweet sixteenth! may you always dwell in a place of safety—god bless—dave. Place of safety. God bless. Dave. He never sent Tina a picture. She took off one of her Chuck Taylors and threw it at his face as hard as she could. Behind the door, Tania yelled, “Mom!” Rochelle yelled from the kitchen, “Tina Rose Taggert! You better not be throwing shoes!” From the den, Dr.Koppelman yelled, “Rochelle! Please!” Tina kicked the door and yelled, “I should have let you sleep!” Outside, they heard sirens whooping and chainsaws gnawing and trucks beeping and men yelling, “Come on back, come on back. Ho! Ho! Ho!”; they heard footsteps running and keys jangling and leather creaking and radios squawking out their address. They heard Chief Kenny say, “Larry, get down off of there. You wanna make the whole thing fall in? I don’t want nobody moving nothing till we figure out what we got. I’m serious, stop pulling on that. AC, we got gas or electric?” Rochelle couldn’t stop crying, which made the girls start crying all over again. She was the worst mother in the world, they were almost out of milk, she was only going to the IGA, both of you were sleeping so peacefully! Chief Kenny said, “Rochelle, hop up a sec, hon. Let me get down there and talk to these girls.” Tina heard Chief Kenny’s knees pop. He said, “Miss Tania? You down there?” Rochelle said, “Girls, you can talk to Chief Kenny. Mommy’s right here.” Tania said, “Yes, sir.” “Have you read the lesson for tomorrow yet?” Mrs. Chief Kenny taught the primary class at Sunday school. Tania had just moved up. She said, “No, sir.” “I don’t think Mrs. Chief Kenny has, either. AC, turn that thing down. Go up there and tell him if he’s got a question to walk across the yard and ask it. I can see him talking from here. Miss Tania, I’m shining a light. Can you see the light?” “No, sir. Is it night?” “No, ma’am, it is not. It’s turned into a real pretty afternoon. Sun came out. Miss Tina? You down there, too?” Tania said, “She’s afraid.” “I bet she is. I know I would be. Do you like Twix, Miss Tina? Mrs.Chandaluri says you like Twix.” Tania said, “We like Twix.” “Miss Tina, I need to hear you say something. I need to make sure you’re not hurt.” “She’s not hurt.” “Miss Tania? Honey? Let Miss Tina talk. Miss Tina? How old are you?” Tina said, “I want Mommy.” “Fair enough,” Chief Kenny said. His knees popped again. He said, “Rochelle, here. Draw me a floor plan on the back of this. I need to find Worm.” Tania Taggert, you know what I like to do when the weather gets bad? I like to stand out in the yard and listen to the sirens and see if I can see a tornado. Not me! I stay inside and turn on the Watch 2 Watch U Weather Center. And if I hear there’s a tornado warning, I like to get in my car and drive toward the darkest cloud I can find. I like to snarl up traffic and cause accidents and get in the way of all the first responders. Not me! I go to my place of safety. What’s that? A place of safety is a basement or an interior room, like a bathroom or a closet. I try to stay away from windows and put as many walls as possible between me and the storm. Wow! You must be very smart. I’m not just smart. I’m Watch 2 Watch U weather wise! Hey, that ice cream looks pretty good. Can I have some? Get your own, Dave. Get your own. Chief Kenny turned a giant worm loose underneath the house. It talked to itself as it crawled toward them: Okay, that’s a nail, and, that’s a nail, and, damn, that’s a lot of nails. Is that loose? Nope. Then put that arm through here and that leg there, and my foot’s stuck. Nope, not stuck. Is that a spider? Not a spider. I don’t know what that was. Could’ve been a spider. Tina was going to scream as soon as she saw it. And, something’s wet. I don’t want to know what that is. I know what that is. And, it’s nasty. Will that move? Yep, that moves. Don’t move that. And, found a waffle iron. And, somebody’s—I think it’s a robe. And, whoa. Stove in the staircase. Please don’t fall on me, stove. And, there’s the washing machine. Chief Kenny? I’m almost there. Chief Kenny said, “Worm, turn that thing off. I’m about six feet away from where you are.” Tina opened her mouth and drew in a deep breath. When Dr.Koppelman ducked under the caution tape, nobody stopped him. He was the radiologist at Dana Memorial. Rochelle was the X-ray receptionist. Why didn’t somebody stop him? She didn’t want him to see her house like this, and she didn’t want him to see her like this. Sweatpants and flip-flops and a ratty Alabama T-shirt that had belonged to Tommy Taggert. She was covered in mud and her hair was a mess and she didn’t have makeup on and she wasn’t wearing a bra and her toenails were painted two different colors because the girls couldn’t agree. And she was the worst mother in the world. She had left her children alone while they were asleep and a tornado had come and destroyed the house and they were trapped underneath it and now somebody named Worm was trying to find a way to get them out while she watched Chief Kenny talk to him through a hole. Dr.Koppelman didn’t move to hug her, which was good, because half the town was on the other side of the caution tape, watching, and the other half was in the volunteer fire department on their side of the tape, also watching. “Rochelle,” he said. “Oh, Rochelle. I am so sorry.” She said, “Thank you for coming, Dr.Koppelman.” Like this was a party. Just dumb. “Of course,” he said. “Of course.” He often said things twice, a tic they sometimes made fun of in X-ray. Where’s Dr.Koppelman gone? Lunch, lunch. When will he be back? One, one. “I came as soon as I heard about the girls.” If she had spoken at that moment, she would have burst into tears again, so she bit her lip and nodded. Please don’t be nice to me right now. “Are they injured?” She shook her head. “Good,” he said. “Good.” She liked Dr.Koppelman well enough as a boss. He could be a little passive-aggressive, but unlike all the other male bosses she’d had, he was never aggressive-aggressive. He might slap a misfiled film down on the counter a little harder than was necessary, but he would never say anything to you about misfiling it. He never made you feel bad in front of anybody else. He said, “Can I call anyone for you? I know you have family in North Carolina. Have they been notified?” “I’ll call Mama later. It’s fine.” “What about your husband? Would you like me to contact your husband?” Rochelle shook her head again. What to say about Tommy Taggert? He was shacked up with some Cajun whore in Bayou Goula, Louisiana. He had parked Rochelle and the girls in Dana because he had cousins in town, and said they wouldn’t be there long. Then he left before Tina could walk. The cousins wouldn’t talk to her. He made good money working offshore, but what he sent home barely covered day care at Mama Too, the cheap place on the other side of town. Ex-husband. She rented the Pore House from the church month-to-month—she wasn’t supposed to know that’s what people in town called it, but she did—and now even it was gone. Her mother had a new husband who didn’t like kids. You made your bed. So here she was. Tina squealed so loudly that Chief Kenny jerked away from the vent and reached to turn down the volume on his radio, even though it wasn’t on. The worm had one big blue eye, so bright it blinded Tina to look at it. It said, “Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Then the eye moved away from her face and lit up her feet, and she saw that the worm was a man wearing a light on a headband, which he took off and dangled toward her, like a mouse he was holding by the tail. “See?” he said. “See?” Tania smacked Tina on the top of her head and said, “Stop.” Tina stopped squealing and said, “Ow.” Rochelle said, “Tina? What is it, baby? What’s wrong?” The man said, “She’s okay. I think I just scared her with my light.” He was wearing a fireman’s coat and heavy gloves; the yellow stripes on the cuffs of the coat flashed when the light hit them. A drop of sweat rolled down his nose and jumped off the end. He said, “Girls, I am so sorry. I wouldn’t scare you for the world.” Tania said, “She thought you were a worm.” “Well,” the man said. “I’ve heard that before.” “We could hear you talking to yourself.” Rochelle said, “Tina? Honey? Mr.Worm isn’t a worm. That’s just his name.” “Ah, Robert,” Worm said. “Robbie. Rob. Worm. Whatever. I like Robert.” Chief Kenny said, “Worm? Are those girls okay?” “Yes, sir. They’re looking out at me like a couple of little owls. And they do not appear to be injured.” Tina said, “Dave Dimon told us to get in the basement.” “That’s great,” Chief Kenny said. “Somebody needs to tell Dave Dimon that.” “He might put you on TV,” Worm said. Chief Kenny said, “So, what’re we looking at?” “Ah, let’s see, let me get this light back on. I’m in kind of a little lean-to crawl space made by a big hunk of floor deck jammed down against the wall. And, it looks like the whole mess is balanced on a joist laying on top of the washer and dryer. I don’t like the way any of it looks, to be honest.” “You think we can lift it?” “Ah, ten-ten. I’d be afraid to try that.” “You think you can get a jack under that joist?” “Doubtful. The little girls would have to come out here where I am, and they’re better off where they are.” “What about the stairway?” “Ah, that’s where the stove is, and, it don’t look like it wants to be messed with.” “Can you crawl ’em out?” “Ten-ten. Nails and glass everywhere.” Chief Kenny said, “Well, Worm, daggummit.” “I know it, Chief. I know it.” “Okay. Crawl back out here and draw me a picture.” “On my way. Oh, girls,” he said. He twisted the light to the side, so it didn’t shine in their faces. “I almost forgot. I brought you some presents. Let’s see if I can reach back in this pocket. There. Here’s a little flashlight for you to hold, and, here’s a little flashlight for you to hold.” “Thank you!” “And, do you know what’s in that other pocket? Don’t shine that in my eyes, hon.” Tania said, “What?” “Why, it’s Twix. Here’s one for you. And here’s one for you. Mrs. Chandaluri told me I better not come back out there unless I gave you those.” Chief Kenny decided to dig a trench perpendicular to the house and cut a hole through the basement wall with a masonry saw and get the girls out that way. He said, “AC, go find Flea Hardin and tell him to saddle up and get over here with his digger.” “The CAT?” “No, the smaller one. The Kubota.” “We could probably get Stovepipe here sooner. It’s Saturday. He’s probably down at his mama’s house. He’s got that little Komatsu.” “Yeah, and Stovepipe’s like as not to knock that wall down, too.” Two years ago, in the First Baptist cemetery, Stovepipe had accidentally smashed in the lid of Mavis Steppe’s casket with the bucket of his backhoe while digging Garland Steppe’s grave. It hadn’t been his fault—he had dug where he was told—but the Steppes had raised hell. Stovepipe had lost a couple of graveyards over it. AC said, “Chief, you know, that’s probably not fair to ’Pipe.” Chief Kenny said, “You’re probably right.” “I mean, that wasn’t his fault.” Chief Kenny said, “AC, I really don’t care at this point. Go find me a backhoe and somebody who knows how to drive it.” AC’s given name was Wayne, but the year he made assistant chief, he’d messed up by signing the Christmas party invitations ass. chief. Now nobody called him Wayne. Sons of bitches. He said, “Well, I’ll get somebody.” Flea Hardin wasn’t home. The little digger, the Kubota, was out back, but the CAT and the trailer and Flea’s big truck were gone. Stovepipe’s Sunday truck was parked outside his mother’s house. He opened the door and said, “AC, please don’t tell me you’re here about those little girls.” AC said, “We need you to dig ’em out.” Stovepipe said, “Are they alive?” AC said, “They’re not hurt, but the house collapsed into the basement. Worm says it’s a mess.” “You gonna dig down and saw through the block wall?” AC said, “That’s the plan.” Stovepipe nodded. He said, “All right, let me tell Mama where I’m going.” When Dr.Koppelman reappeared, he motioned to Rochelle and turned his back to the caution tape and handed her a set of keys. “These are for the lake house,” he said. She quickly lowered her hand to her side and said, “Dr.Koppelman.” He said, “You and the girls need a place to stay, and I hardly ever use the place since, well...” Mimi. Breast cancer. And her husband a radiologist. “Dr.Koppelman, you’re very kind, but I couldn’t possibly.” She tried to hand the keys back but he stuck his hands in his pockets. She had never seen him in jeans before. He looked more normal than she would’ve thought. He said, “No. No. I insist. Just until you find a place. You know which house it is, right?” It was the house where once a year Dr.Koppelman held the Awkward Cookout. Everybody wore bathing suits under their clothes, but nobody ever swam. The office manager and all the techs side-eyed Rochelle, afraid that she was going to strip down to her bathing suit, while the husbands watched her more openly, hoping that she would. Dr.Koppelman scurried around, asking whether anyone wanted another beer, which everybody did but nobody was about to take. They gnawed on the hamburgers he had grilled well beyond done-done, and tried to avoid looking at his legs, which, though hairless and supernaturally white, had surprisingly large calf muscles. She said, “Are you sure?” Sometimes people asked Rochelle questions that only pretended to be questions. They said things like, “Well, that tornado turned out to be quite a blessing, didn’t it?” What are you supposed to say to that? If she said, “It’s never a good thing to have your house destroyed by a tornado while your children are inside,” they would say, “But you wound up with two houses and a doctor, though, didn’t you?” To be honest, she had always wanted to live in Dr.Koppelman’s lake house. It was the kind of place you love so much in a dream that you wake up wondering whether it’s real and how you can get there. Beat-up hardwood floors with cow paths worn into the varnish; sun-bleached, poplar-paneled walls, and that mildewy, old-book smell you want a lake house to have; lumpy, mismatched furniture in bad plaids and out-of-date colors that would look tacky anywhere else. Dr.Koppelman and Mimi had bought it furnished when the original owners died and they hadn’t changed a thing. There wasn’t a right angle in the place. If you spilled milk in the kitchen it would run underneath the refrigerator before you could wipe it up. If you didn’t jiggle the handle, the downstairs toilet would run all night. The paint was peeling and the roof was rusted and the screens were rusted and moss was growing on one side of the chimney and the windows rattled when the wind blew. It was perfect. And somehow she had the key. When she and the girls finally made it to the lake house late that night, four carloads of hospital housekeeping staff were just leaving—including fat old Harvey Garwood, the head housekeeper himself, a man whom neither Rochelle nor anyone else at Dana General had ever seen do a lick of work. One last small miracle to end the day. The house was spotless. Gleaming toilets. Dusted ceiling fans. Vacuumed cushions. Dishwasher running. Brand-new shelf paper. Beds made and towels laid out. Hospital corners. The cabinets were filled with little-girl food. Pop-Tarts and Skippy and Chef Boyardee. On the counter, in a sealed envelope with Rochelle’s name typed on the front, was a Walmart gift certificate for $1,000. No note. Two gallons of milk in the fridge. She never gave the key back. Dr.Koppelman came often to the lake that summer and watched night fall from the roof of the boathouse. Lightning bugs. Bats. Fish jumping. Eventually, she began climbing the ladder to join him. Later she couldn’t recall whose idea that had been. One evening, during an otherwise unremarkable sunset, he turned to her and said, “If we were to begin a romantic relationship, I’d have to let you go.” He said it so matter-of-factly—Rochelle, please file this, Rochelle, tell Dr.Militana I’ll call him back—that only later did she realize what a deeply strange thing it had been to say. She replied, equally matter-of-factly, “What would I do without a job?” He said, “I suppose we would need to get married.” Rochelle, call the Lucky Dragon for me. Happy Family. Steamed rice. Right away, Dr.Koppelman. She said, “But I’m a Baptist.” He said, “I’m not observant.” Worm came back with bicycle helmets. Tania said, “Are we going to get bicycles?” “I don’t know about today,” Worm said. “But I bet sometime, sure. Everybody gets a bicycle sometime. Let me work on this strap. There. That looks good. Tania, see if that fits.” Worm had a son Tina’s age, Robert Jr., whom he called RJ but kids at school would insist on calling Baby Worm. The first day of kindergarten, Baby Worm had given Tina a Twix he had carried to school in his pants pocket. It was squishy inside the wrapper, and too gross to eat, but for some reason she kept it in her underwear drawer and cried when Rochelle threw it away the summer she started third grade. Tania said, “I don’t know why we have to wear these helmets when we don’t even have bicycles.” Worm said, “They’re for in case the big bad wolf comes back.” Tina said, “It was a lion.” Eventually, Tina married RJ, whom she called Babe, although in his sock feet he only came up to her nose. Of course, by then she was six feet tall, and played softball for Florida State. Babe eventually took a PhD in agronomy and got a job as a research scientist with a seed company in Scotland County. They lived outside Laurinburg. Worm said, “A lion?” Tania said, “She says it was a lion that blew the house down.” Worm said, “Huh.” Tania said, “She says she saw it. I had my eyes closed.” Worm said, “I guess it might’ve been a lion.” Tania said, “Did you see it?” “No, I was at home watching Bill Dance. It’s a fishing show.” “Why were you watching a fishing show?” “I don’t know. I guess because it was on.” “Why do people call you Worm?” “Because I’m good at crawling under things.” “Why do you talk to yourself?” “Because I don’t like crawling under things.” Chief Kenny said, “Girls, here in a little bit we’re gonna fire up a big machine called a backhoe and dig a hole and get y’all out, so I need y’all to keep those helmets on, okay?” Worm said, “And I’m gonna stay right here.” By the time Stovepipe got saddled up and over to the Pore House, the firemen and the maintenance guys had sawed the fallen trees into pieces and dragged them out of the street. Alabama Power had dropped the sagging power lines. Nothing in that part of town was hot, and anyhow, they were going to have to set new poles, might as well stay out of the way. At the IGA, the parking lot was full. Cars lined up nose to tail on both sides of the street all the way down to the roadblock. Every flashing light in town swarmed the barricades. AC said, “’Pipe, can you fit through there?” AC couldn’t back a trailer in a straight line to save his life. Stovepipe said, “As long as nobody opens their car door I’ll be all right.” He could back a trailer about as easily as he could pull one. At the end of the street, two deputies moved aside the barricades and waved him through. He cut her deep, backed into the yard, stopped the truck, chocked the trailer, and shook hands with Chief Kenny. Chief Kenny said, “You hear what we got?” Stovepipe nodded. “How much hole you need?” “About seven feet.” “All right. I can do that.” Chief Kenny said, “Rochelle, hop up here, hon. We need to get started. This is Stovepipe. Stovepipe, this is Rochelle. She’s the mother of the little girls. Stovepipe’s going to dig the hole for us.” He pointed at the Komatsu hunched on the trailer. Rochelle was the prettiest girl Stovepipe had ever seen, maybe the prettiest girl there ever was. Her hand was tiny and cold. Until that moment, he had never given his calluses much thought, but now realized how terrible his hand must feel to somebody like her. Maybe Mama had some lotion he could use. He wondered whether Mama would like her. Mama didn’t like anybody. He let go of her hand and said, “Ma’am.” She said, “Thank you so much for coming.” “I was glad to.” AC said, “Stovepipe’s the best gravedigger in Dana.” Chief Kenny said, “God almighty, AC.” AC said, “Well, he is.” Rochelle closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath, opened them, and gifted Stovepipe with a small, wavering smile. He realized then that he loved her, that he would probably always love her. He would never tell anybody that he loved her, though, especially not her. He said, “I dig other things too. Drain fields. Septic tanks.” And then suddenly Rochelle was crying. She said, “Mr.Stovepipe, please don’t bury my children.” If someone had rolled a hand grenade down through the yard, he would’ve thrown himself on top of it. He took off his cap and said, “Ma’am, if you were to drop a hair bow in the yard, I could pick it up in the bucket of that backhoe and drop it in your hand without messing up the grass. This is good dirt and it’ll come up easy. I won’t touch the house and I won’t make the ground shake and I won’t scare those little girls any more than they already are. I promise you that when I get on that tractor I’ll dig you the most peaceful hole you ever saw.” He marveled at the words falling out of his mouth. It was like listening to somebody else talk, like getting interested in a TV show Mama was watching. He was curious what was going to happen next. He waited. Eventually AC said, “Shoot, ’Pipe, I don’t even know what a peaceful hole is.” Rochelle wiped her eyes and set free another heartbreaking smile. She said, “That sounds good, Mr.Stovepipe. Thank you.” “No, ma’am. Thank you.” That seemed to be all there was. He put his cap back on. Chief Kenny said, “Mount up, Stovepipe, that’s just the kind of hole we need. Worm, y’all ready?” Worm said, “Girls, they’re gonna start digging now. You ready?” Tania said, “Yes, sir.” “How about you, Tina?” Tina clicked on her flashlight. Worm said, “Chief, we’re good to go.” Chief Kenny said, “Miss Tania? Miss Tina? This tractor’s gonna be a little loud, okay?” Tania said, “Okay.” She drowned the summer after she graduated from high school. Teenage boys and personal watercraft. Doctor’s daughter killed in boating accident. AC snagged the body when they dragged the lake. Dave Dimon gave the eulogy. The Chandaluris closed the store for the day. Tina balanced her flashlight on her knees and stuck her fingers in her ears. Rochelle called, “Girls, I have to get out of the way now, but I’m not leaving you, okay?” This time, when she turned away from the house, Dr.Koppelman opened his arms. Tania said, “Okay.” Chief Kenny said, “Worm, I’m gonna turn my radio back on. Let me know if anything starts to move.” “Fire and rescue?” “Ah, go to Channel Six.” “Ten-four.” Stovepipe said, “We good?” If you saw him crying on the backhoe the day he dug Tania’s grave, he did not give a damn. Chief Kenny said, “Fire it up.” Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. ’s most recent story collection is Mr. Tall. “An unexpectedly excellent magazine that stands out amid a homogenized media landscape.” —the New York Times"

        "story": "After the event, it was observed that there can be no neutral bystanders. If employment of the passive voice has also been observed in the preceding sentence—as in, if some hypothetical person has just noticed that passive voice—the same hypothetical person might wish to ask: Who was it that did the observing? It was the bystanders themselves. Afterwards, though none of them would have said they did anything wrong exactly, none of them felt exactly right or neutral. They were British citizens or legally domiciled residents all, and all naked, which was not technically illegal. (One of them might have smoked a bit of a cheeky spliff earlier, which technically was illegal, but honestly who’s going to give him any trouble here?) A few could be described as not entirely nude since they wore sensible sandals and wide-brimmed hats. Placed at top and bottom, these articles only accentuated the bareness of the bodies they bookended; it was the citizens with hats and sandals who looked the most naked. None of them wished anybody any harm. None could be described as having very strong political convictions. Some read the Guardian and some read the Mail and some read the Sun and some read nothing at all. Not one among them could be said to be fundamentally better than any of the others. It looked to be the last hot day of the year, and the British citizens were going to enjoy it while it lasted, each in his or her own way. They’d come well prepared. Melanin levels varied, but most of the citizens had applied thick white lotion to their bodies to militate against UV damage from the failing yet persistent sunshine of the late British summer of a very bad year. Everyone would have agreed on that, that it had been a very bad year—continued to be a very bad year, because it wasn’t over yet. But it was nice today, the weather was nice and that was something. And you could be at the beach for free, that was allowed. One entirely and legally nude citizen on a rattan beach mat could be observed hunched over in a posture that made three snug rolls of his middle, concertinaed, and these rolls swelled and subsided as their owner blew into the aperture of something slack and pink which, tremblingly, began to rise into the form of a flamingo with a doughnut for a body. It was daft, a fellow citizen was heard to comment, laughing. Whereupon the other citizen began to puppet the flotation device, adopting a falsetto to ventriloquize: Who you calling daft? Elsewhere on the beach, a party of two was erecting a windbreak whose blocks of color—black currant and orange and lime—were reminiscent of a particular brand of ice lolly fondly remembered from childhood. This brand of lolly had endured to become a part of a next generation’s childhood, could indeed be purchased today from the ice cream van idling in the car park high above the beach. The vehicle’s chimes played a traditional English folk song dating from the sixteenth century, and though distant, the melody carried on the sea breeze and was instantly recognizable to the citizens, one of whom would later find herself humming the tune in the car on the way home, despite everything. One child had recently learned to play this tune on the recorder, which was lovely sweetheart but we don’t need to have it again, okay? But if asked in this moment, none of the citizens would have been able to supply the words to the tune. No one could remember. Four miles from this spot, nine hundred and fifty-three years and ten months ago to the day, a significant battle had been fought. One army, led by the illegitimate son of a French duke, had fought another, led by a British king. The bastard had won. That day’s violent events, including the fatal puncturing of the king’s eyeball by enemy arrow, had been commemorated in a tapestry whose replica hung in a nearby museum, to be visited by highly supervised schoolchildren clutching the worksheets they’d been issued. They might learn that an estimated two thousand combatants had died. This might be one of the facts they were taught. But as the British beachgoers peeled cling film from sandwiches, or thwacked Velcro balls between Velcro paddles in movements that made heavy breasts lurch and swing, or wincingly tiptoed into the glaucous waters of the English Channel, yelping softly as testicles tightened with the chill, none were thinking of the significant battle or the invaders who had come from the sea. History was in the past. Other problems now. Besides, it was a lovely day, a sunny day on the south coast. Around two o’clock—several of the citizens thought to check the time on their devices, after noticing—there was a commotion in the water. Some sat up and shielded their eyes to better make out what was going on. The Velcro ball hit the Velcro paddle and was not thrown again. What the citizens saw was a small vessel, an inflatable dinghy, very crowded with people, mostly men of middle age with dark beards, some of whom were jumping into the water, many of them shouting. The wailing of a child could be heard. The vessel, bobbing and jerking in haphazard circles in the rough, small waves, seemed to be in difficulty. Later, it would be noted that its outboard motor had broken. This became an established fact. How long the vessel had been adrift, however, remained unknown. Among the voluntarily naked British citizens on the beach, the first thing observed was that the boat people had no bags. They carried nothing and had only the clothes on their bodies. This was not remarked on, merely observed. It was perhaps too shocking and obvious to mention. The faraway country that the people had fled was one that few of the British citizens and domiciled legal residents could point to on a map. If asked, most of them would have said they’d heard of it, yeah, but weren’t totally sure where it was, to be honest. They wouldn’t be able to say, exactly, what had caused the war there. They’d be hazy about the unfortunate ways in which their own country and its allies might have been involved or not. One British citizen stood up uncertainly. He’d seen stuff like this on the BBC. But that had been the news, not real life! For a sec he wondered whether it was some sort of joke, some funny business being filmed for telly or the internet or what have you. But that couldn’t be right. His wife would know. Darren looked down at Shelly’s ample body. She was curled on her side, palms prayered into a little pillow for her head, and her mouth was slightly open as she snored, her rising and falling flesh creamy pale, her nipples very pink. She had lovely boobs, his wife. But he couldn’t be thinking about boobs right now. “’Ere...,” he whispered. Some urgency. “Shells...” She scrunched her face. “Darren, leave it out, I’m having a sleep.” “Not being funny but I think some migrants are coming.” “Give it a rest will you.” Earlier, he’d been pulling her leg about sharks out there in the Channel, said he’d seen some circling, she’d better watch it when she went for her paddle. “Shells, I’m not having a laugh. There’s a boat. With a load of migrants on it.” She sat up. “I don’t think you’re meant to say that.” “Say what?” “‘Migrants.’ That’s rude, isn’t it?” “What are we meant to call them now, then?” Both of them looked out to sea. She put her glasses on. “Oh, Lord love ’em,” she said. “Those poor people.” Darren squared his shoulders, crossed his arms over his chest, and for the first time that day became aware of his penis dangling below his belly. Shells liked to tell him he was a grower not a shower, which had maybe been funny the first time she’d said it. They had been married twenty-nine years. Bearded men were jumping out of the boat, spreading their arms against its sides to steady it or steer it, shouting at each other, disagreeing vehemently in a language the British citizens didn’t understand. No one seemed to be in charge. “Go help them, Darren.” After a second’s hesitation he said, “All right,” good-naturedly. With a quick downward tug on each side of his hat, like a soldier going into battle, Darren set off down the beach, stiffly, doggedly. His buttocks—squashed and somehow officious-looking—were observed by his wife, as was the fact that he was wearing nothing but that yellow bucket hat printed with googly-eyed crocodiles. The crocodiles snapped at each other in a jolly way. Their grandson, back in Bexley with his mum, had a matching hat, much smaller. Liam had a thing about crocodiles and Kayleigh had a thing about putting her baby boy and her old dad in matching outfits and so, last Christmas, it had been these bucket hats for the both of them. Shelly had put pictures of the two of them on Facebook and they’d got a lot of likes. Elsewhere, attention was paid to a pale child in inflatable orange armbands at the shore. Had someone been observing closely, it would have been noted that the fear leaking from the boat seemed to make its way into the watching child quickly, in the way of spilled and twitching mercury. This hypothetical sympathetic observer would have witnessed how, a moment ago, the child had seemed carefree in its nakedness but now, stricken by the spectacle of the failing dinghy and its desperate passengers, looked vulnerable in nothing but those puffy orange floaties. The hypothetical witness might also have noted that when, delirious with fatigue, the pregnant woman in the boat saw this pale child there was something sad and hopeful, an awful sort of miracle, in the fact of her smiling, of her dredging up this smile for the little boy on the shore and then finding her smile real. But the small British child was already turning and running back to its parent because Mummy Mummy Mummy why are the grown-ups wearing floaties, aren’t they just for kids, don’t all grown-ups know how to swim? “All right?” Darren had successfully reached the water’s edge and was thus in earshot of the boat people. He put his hands on his hips, hoping to look authoritative and capable. It occurred to him that maybe this lot didn’t speak English, so he did a big, friendly wave too. “Bit of trouble with the motor, is it? Give you a hand?” From the dinghy, the new arrivals observed that the man waving at them was naked and seemed entirely unashamed by his nakedness. Despite exhaustion and dehydration and eyes sore from sun glare and a burning throat and an empty stomach and the pressure of a full bladder beneath a full womb, despite all this and everything else, the pregnant woman found herself amused that the first person they encountered in England should be a tubby little qazam with a small penis and a silly hat. She remarked as much to her sister. “Majnoon.” Aisha giggled and adjusted her hijab, even if it was crazy to care about her appearance at a moment like this, this arrival, at last. “Huwwa fakhur bi hamamtu.” Faizah was trying to hold Khalil still. The boy had begun screaming as soon as they saw land. She knew, as did the men, that this was not the place they had planned to arrive. This was wrong. It would be hard to find the next place from here. And as soon as they reached the beach they’d have to move very fast, or things could go wrong. They would be on their own from here. She’d have to get that across to Aisha, who took everything more lightly than she did. This lightness included the way in which Aisha, in her passivity, had unknowingly granted herself the privilege of being more daughter than little sister to Faizah after their parents passed away. Which was another heavy thing Faizah had to carry. Darren took another step into the waves. But now these blokes were shouting and making angry, shooing sort of motions at him, proper ticked off. It was as if he’d done something wrong. There were a pair of ladies in the boat in those wotsits, thingamijibs. He plucked his hat off his head and held it over his privates. He cleared his throat. “English?” he said. “Speak English?” Farther up the beach, it was noted by one British citizen that a few people in the dinghy were indeed wearing life vests the same color as the armbands of her own children. This citizen wondered why some got life vests and others didn’t. By what criteria had they been apportioned? This same citizen was reminded, uncomfortably, of the regulation orange jumpsuits that prisoners on a distant island were made to wear. (Were they still there?) Orange was a very visible color, was why. And now this citizen with orange on her mind witnessed people in the boat throwing off their vests and stumbling out through the shallows towards land, while others shoved the dinghy up to shore. Surf hit its sides and its bouncy form bumped up over the shingle at the water’s edge. In this moment it looked like a large toy, a big fun thing. A minor disillusionment, the first of many, was experienced by the youngest child of the British citizen upon hearing the words, no, sweetheart, not all grown-ups know how to swim. The mother of the child observed two women leaving behind the men and noted a likeness of movement in them that made her suspect they were sisters. Their black robes dragged through the sea, heavy and waterlogged, as they pulled a refractory toddler between them. The little boy looked about the same age as Emma’s youngest. Nobody wanted any trouble. But one citizen, seeing that about half a dozen men were now furious with her husband, who was definitely shorter and older and nakeder than them, seeing that these men were shouting at him and that two of them had raised their fists, seeing that they looked, to be honest, like they wanted to wallop him, her Darren whose heart was always in the right place, her Darren who wouldn’t know a punch if it hit him, which it looked like it was about to—well, she reached for her phone. Meanwhile, one British citizen had retreated, breathless and wheezing, to the shade of a striped beach umbrella, following the exertions of a leisure activity. The fellow citizen who joined her was heard to remark, well at least you bloody brought it this time. This comment was ignored by her companion, who, having inhaled deeply from the small plastic device, took another free deep breath, pulled a sarong around her own nakedness, and asked her companion where she reckoned the people in the boat had come from, then. “They don’t look too happy about that bloke sticking his oar in, do they? What a wally.” “Not much use, is he?” “Men.” The other citizen agreed. The male British citizen under discussion was seen to drop his hat as he raised his palms and walked backwards a few steps, stumbling slightly on the shingle so the flesh of his left buttock quivered as he righted himself. Elsewhere, another citizen noticed her voice becoming a bit wobbly on the line as she said into her phone, “I don’t want any trouble, it’s just...” not really knowing what she meant. But they said they’d be right there. They seemed to think she’d done the right thing and they called her love, which was nice. When the police arrived, one citizen, clocking this new and alarming development, was heard to mutter “oh shit, man” to no one but himself while plucking a small white earbud from first his left, then his right ear. Tinny, desiccated, known-the-world-over words of peace and love issued forth from miniature speakers. Let’s get together and feel all right. Among the items in the citizen’s bag, which was red, green, gold, and black, was another little bag whose contents were not, technically, legal. Dreads and tats and the hole in his earlobe kept wide with a tunnel of black silicone were legal, but the British citizen, who wasn’t born yesterday mate, knew that less enlightened people tended to think he looked a bit dodgy. He hopped into his shorts—didn’t want his willy out in front of the coppers, did he—shouldered his bag, and ambled up the beach towards the stairs, casual, chill. Un-criminal. There were three of them bustling past him towards the sea, Her Majesty’s finest, all of them in bulky black vests and helmets, and in case you didn’t get it their high-vis vests said police across the back. The citizen gave them a wide berth so they wouldn’t catch a whiff. The migrants were still dragging the dinghy up the beach as the naked and now hatless British citizen with his palms raised—an onlooker offering words of encouragement—backed away while trying not to seem like he was backing away. “There y’go!” he said. “Bob’s your uncle!” Abdul was ignoring these blandishments when he spotted something behind the ridiculous naked man. The sight sent a jolt of cortisol through his body and an urgent shout out of his lungs. He and all the others began to scatter, the boat and the naked man abandoned. Confused, the British citizen turned and saw three officers running towards him, grim and purposeful. Aware of being stark naked, Darren moved his hands to form a fig leaf. Another citizen clamped her own hands over her mouth, finding herself suppressing a naughty giggle. Because what if she put this on Facebook? That would be quite a laugh, wouldn’t it? Darren, starkers, surrounded by bobbies! Couldn’t make it up! But come on, be serious, Shells. This was serious. He was a witness, wasn’t he? They’d want a statement. Elsewhere, another citizen glanced over her shoulder, hastily pulled herself into a dress, and winced at a whistle blown by one of the three advancing officers, the shrill of it a rip of violence through the mild day. They had batons as well as whistles. The dinghy had been left there; the men were vanishing. “Are they baddies, Mum?” “No, sweets, they’re not baddies. They just... need things.” “So why are the police chasing them?” One employee of Her Majesty had never taken a statement from a naked bloke before and looked forward to telling Chloe about it at tea; he knew she’d find it funny, all these nudies. This old geezer here with his hands over his todger, calling him “officer.” “How many again, sir?” “’Bout a dozen I’d say, officer?” Ian, taking this down, glanced up from his notepad to see one of his fellow constables go arse over tit as he tried to tackle one of the migrants. The migrant was getting away. Looked like they’d all got away, to be honest. Well. Probably wasn’t terrorists. Didn’t look like they’d come here to blow anything up. With what. Not that he’d say anything like that back at the station. Upholding the law meant upholding the law. That was his job and he was proud to do it. One of the British citizens on the beach, shielding her eyes because she didn’t want to look away to try to find her sunglasses right now, clocked the third police officer. Female, shorter-than-average height, medium build but bulked with vest and baton and helmet, hair like a little knot of pastry at the back of her neck, the officer was running towards the two women in black with the efficient, low-key intent of a Jack Russell terrier. The British citizen, a P.E. teacher, was reminded of the lusterless way her year nines jogged about on the netball court only because the game demanded it, and nice girls from Surrey, they complied. The British citizen, whose job also sometimes involved the wearing of a whistle around her neck, was not prepared for the second whistle shriek and the way that this flared the policewoman into a sprint and lunge, like a self-directed command. Nor was Emma okay with seeing how fast and forcefully this professionally armored body slammed into the soft and undefended form of the other, whose robes torqued as she fell, suggesting for a moment the dome of her belly before she hit the sand with no sound. Also not okay with Emma was how rapidly the foreign woman’s wrists were snapped into cuffs behind her back and how roughly she was pulled up onto her knees on the ground, like a person about to be executed, and how the violence of this moment had yanked her hijab askew and how she had no freedom of movement to correct it. Faizah, unable to gesture, her head half bared, raised her face and screamed to Aisha and Khalil to keep running—“Rah la’iki ye ukhti!”—because how stupid could her stupid little sister be to falter now and look back at her with vacant, sheeplike surprise. Faizah gathered her contempt and launched it at her sister, screaming “Hrebi ya benet ya ghabiyeh!” before Aisha finally lifted up her nephew, Faizah’s baby boy, and fled. Unobserved, a green-and-yellow hat, upended like a miniature boat, its crocodiles permanently grinning, bobbed on the backwards drag of a wave and began its castaway journey out in the Atlantic Ocean. As a cry of anguish split from the handcuffed and kneeling woman and grew into a keening wail that seized the entire watching beach, one British citizen was the sole person who heard and bore witness to her own hushed, soft, hurt, pointless syllable as it escaped her, consequential as a blown bubble: “Oh.” High above the beach, the chimes of the ice cream van continued to play the same tune. Its driver was enjoying a nice little earner of a day, thanks very much. As he handed over a 99Flake to a teenage girl in a pink T-shirt he noticed one lady all in black go by behind her. The lady was hurrying but stumbling with her arms full of the weight of a kid screaming bloody murder, banging his fists against her like a right little Mike Tyson. Barry grinned down at his customer, nodded his head in the direction of the woman behind her, and said, “Bloody hot in this weather, I should think.” Yasmin said nothing as she took her ice cream cone. It wasn’t worth it, was it? To say actually she was Muslim, too, and it was a woman’s business whether she wore a headscarf or not, it was between her and Allah. Whatever. The guy was just trying to be friendly, didn’t know any better. As Yasmin walked away she heard the ice cream van rev up and trundle off, chimes Dopplering through the baked air above the tarmac, and she was amazed that it was only now, finally, with the tune wobbling away and fading behind her, nearly gone, that she remembered how the song went, and it was stupid, but this remembering had the feeling of revelation, because all day it had been driving her mad that she couldn’t remember the words... Alas my love... there it was, the old song she’d been made to sing in primary school for some reason because... Alas my love you do me wrong... come to think of it wasn’t the song basically about a guy getting dumped, i.e., quite a weird thing to make a load of little seven-year-olds sing? And she realized now that she’d never really questioned anything at school, why had she never questioned anything?... Alas my love you do me wrong, to cast me off... just done what she was told, always obeyed her teachers... Alas my love you do me wrong, to cast me off... or maybe the song was about something else because surely it had to be about something else? Something a bit more important... To cast me off... more significant in the scheme of things... Alas my love you do me wrong, to cast me off discourteously.

        "story": "Krems, whose splendor the Arab geographer al-Idrisi celebrated in 1153 as surpassing, in his view, that of Vienna, today resembles Vineta, the city submerged by the waters, among whose streets on the seafloor, legend has it, figures can be seen wandering about in ancient garments. A passerby emerges from a door amid the narrow passages; in the twilight, shadows step down from the tapestries into life. In Stein, even more drowsy, not far from the plaque that commemorates Köchel, to whom we owe the cataloguing of Mozart’s compositions, the pharmacist comes to life upon the rare arrival of a stranger; proudly showing him around the entire pharmacy, he vaunts the glories of Stein, not without expressing some criticism of Krems, an echo of the long-standing municipal rivalries between the two towns of the Wachau. His is a fitting setting for the minor reversal of cause and effect that occurred in Krems that evening. A modest hotel renowned for its wine (praised by the emperor Maximilian, though actually considered by others to be too bitter) had been chosen to celebrate my fleeting glory of that day, the result of a lecture on Kafka given that afternoon in Klosterneuburg, the Viennese Escorial. A lecture is always successful, by definition, since the occupational art instructs us to suggest seductive profundities while pretending to conceal them behind witty understatements. I had therefore been successful, like every lecturer, even in the illustrious setting—the monastery-palace houses the relics of Saint Leopold, Duke Leopold III of Babenberg, and displays the obsessive funerary pathos of Charles VI of Hapsburg, the dome topped by the crown and cross, the Hapsburg crown borne as a cross—and the organizers, joined by admirers and circumstantial friends unfailingly present on such occasions, had taken me to dinner, who knows why, in Krems. Snow had fallen, which made the oblivious old town even more deserted and induced one to experience the present, that evening, as if it were already the past, as insubstantial and silent as a memory, a soft emptiness whose whiteness did not seem to be a real mark but a hushed, distant image. I was the luminary of the dinner, coddled by the deference of the small circle. A Triestine lady had joined the group, with inexorable determination, a woman married to an Austrian who for several years had been residing in Linz, one hundred kilometers away. Proud to establish a complicitous familiarity with the celebrated speaker, almost as if laying claim to a property right, the lady at one point told me that her cousin had been in school with me, a classmate, and that she often spoke of me, about us two, about our friendship. “Truthfully, she’s not actually my cousin, she married my cousin, let me see, her maiden name was... I can’t remember, wait, I have the last name on the tip of my tongue, it was...” I did not have female classmates, unfortunately. I grew up in all-male classrooms, surrounded by the sweaty odor of a military barracks; I therefore told her that there must be some mistake, but she insisted, trying to recall the name. I detest parapsychology, and it was certainly not with mysteriosophical self-satisfaction but only with surprise that I found myself saying in calm simplicity, as she kept grasping for that maiden name: “You must be thinking of Nori S., but you’re mistaken, we were not in the same class together and she can’t remember me, because she doesn’t know me. We never spoke to one another.” I was astonished, even more than she was, to have given a name to that generic indeterminacy, but as she marveled, nodding and confirming, I had no time to consider where that simple, irrefutable certainty had come from, because the pleasure the loquacious lady’s patent lie gave me, her indubitable quid pro quo, was far more intense than the scientific morality that compelled me to reject the assertion that did not correspond to the facts. “Yes, of course, she’s the one, how did you manage to guess? Nori, I assure you, remembers you very well, she talks about you often.” I deflected, half-heartedly but unequivocally, as I indulged in a joy as clear as the water of a mountain stream. The falsehood was blatant. Nori S.was in eleventh grade when I was in tenth; she was beautiful and unattainable, with her brown wavy hair that gleamed in the luminous air of the school’s large, wedged-open windows. All the boys had pined for her for years. We loved her, with the firm fidelity of a guard regiment. When she passed in the corridors, deep in thought and unaware of us, she made hundreds of destiny’s recruits understand forever the “beyond” that, as a famous poem has it, is written in every image; on her face, in her almond eyes, it was written even more plainly than in that famous poem. For a seventeen-year-old boy, a beguiling eighteen-year-old girl is more inaccessible than a Hollywood diva is to a professor. Though in general I don’t overrate myself, neither do I unduly sell myself short. Nevertheless, it is, has always been, and will always be unthinkable to bridge the distance between me and Nori, a distance that exists between every foot soldier snapped to attention and the flag that is raised high in the sky and the wind. In our common love for Nori, we learned the universality of Eros, who pursues generality, the absolute, the divine, the Being that unfolds before everyone’s eyes like a clearing in the woods of Monte Nevoso or the sea spread out in front of Miholašcica. In that love professed without individual exception we were all brothers, as we were before death and the future that awaited us, impenetrable thanks to the excessive light of youth that love radiated. The only one of my companions I envied a little was Stefanutti: though obviously not noticed by Nori in the least, his unrequited love was well known and everyone teased him for it. He was the official unhappy lover, so to speak, the delegate of us all. He evidently had a vocation for representation, which would later lead him to the benches of some assembly—a position certainly lower than the deputy of Nori’s lovers, but still representative. I envied him because the teasing and general ridicule in some way put him in a public relationship with Nori, albeit one of rejection and privation, while I was not in any relationship with her, not even an indirect, negative one. The fact is, I knew Nori but she didn’t know me, just as I am able to recognize the face of the president of the United States while mine is totally unknown to him. It was therefore impossible for Nori to have spoken to the lady about me, because Nori was unaware of my existence; we had never exchanged a single word and I could not therefore be a direct object of her sentences, which were undoubtedly as lyrical as the flight of seagulls. I enjoyed the irony of the situation, because the lady flaunted her acquired cousin’s acquaintance with me, thinking that such familiarity might make a little of my brief glory that evening rub off on her, whereas the very idea that Nori had talked about me—untenable though it was—was a field promotion, an Olympic laurel. So as she protested and reiterated the truthfulness of her words, I told her that I was happy and that I was grateful to her for the lie, even though I knew it was a lie, and for the rest of the evening I surrendered to the pleasure it gave me. I let myself be lulled by the fantasy as if by a piece of music, not at all bothered by my awareness of its unreality. That evening in Krems, however, was only an ironic, tender prelude to my return match. Almost a year later, in Rome, a friend, talking about former high school classmates of ours, told me that he had run into Nori a few weeks earlier while on vacation, at the seashore, and that she had remembered me, recalling various things about me. At that point it was too much and, despite the late hour, I called the number of the hotel on the island where they had accidentally run into each other and chatted on the beach. As I waited for the hotel to put me through, I realized how bizarre the phone call was, and when I heard a female voice, I stammered my name in confusion, saying that a few months earlier, in Krems, her cousin, Mrs. So-and-so, had told me that she... and so I had taken the liberty.... But I was immediately interrupted by the voice at the other end of the line, which greeted me with warm familiarity and began talking to me as if we were old friends. Had I therefore become Svevo’s vecchione, the old man who many years later catches up with a young woman he’d glimpsed one evening, only in memory settling an account left unresolved, indeed not even kindled half a century before, because the light of life in the present is clouded by the anguish of living? The faint summer breeze drifting in from the window, close to the phone, was a wind of infinite spaces, in which everything is present and concurrent, the rotation of a planet and the light of a star that comes from far away. Perhaps the Danube near Krems was the ocean that tightly encircles the world, waters that flow and at the same time return, shores that are forever reflected in its waves. Time is the lord of causality: a cause produces an effect and therefore precedes it. But from an effect we go back to the cause that produced it: the familiarity on the phone was therefore the effect of a mutual acquaintance that must have existed in the past and therefore conditioned the present familiarity, reaching back in time to create, decades ago, something that had not then existed. Yes, time is a causal order, but if the cause propagates in space-time with a speed never greater than that of light, I told myself, clutching at vague, school-day recollections and clarifications sought without much success from physicist friends, restricted relativity affirms—I think this is what it says—that two events which cannot be linked through a causal signal traveling with a speed less than or equal to that of light cannot be ordered in absolute time. So are the confidences shared with the cousin from Linz and the chat on the phone the cause—or the effect? perhaps both? so confusing and so fascinating—of my acquaintance with Nori that will occur forty, no, almost sixty years ago, and has the Danube’s water that flows to Krems already emptied into the Black Sea? To avoid confusion, it would be sensible to reform the grammar books and reduce all verbs to the present infinitive. Even Nori’s passing in the school corridors—like Parmenides’ Being—was it not nor will it not be but only is? Time is an extension of the soul, said St. Augustine—my soul, which extends to embrace times when I did not yet exist? I wish that it were Nori’s instead and that it embraced me as well, the smallest point in the great sphere of the heart, in which everything is and to which everything returns. Her hair, who knows why I remember it darker, one luminous though moonless evening that descended over the sea, a glow still on the horizon; the surf breaks white on the shore, recedes and returns, it is there, the bright smile of her face and of the world. In Miramare, once, they had taken all the school’s senior classes to visit the well-known physics center established in the park of the enchanting, kitschy castle from which an improvident, committed archduke had set out to become a Moorish emperor. “In conformal field theory physics that generalizes Einstein’s relativity”—a lecture by the distinguished scientist was part of the educational outing, the high school principal had said—“there are today geometric entities that call to mind Parmenides’ concept of eternity...” The voice reemerged mellow and self-assured from the distance of time, a rustling of leaves in the sea breeze that drifted among the cypresses and oaks planted by Maximilian and Carlota in that park, an island of the blessed and the dead. The voice scattered in the echo of remembrance, waves rippled in concentric circles in the park’s lake into which, listening or not listening, one or the other of us would occasionally throw a rock. The sound waves that at the time had dispersed those words among the rocks and foliage, beyond the marble sphinx at the foot of the castle gazing at the sphinxlike sea, beyond the auditory canal and eardrum that had transmitted them to the judicious, well-mannered neural synapses of the listeners, grateful for the soporific opportunity afforded by that talk, as by any beneficial lecture, had spread even farther, into the dark woods that fringe and nearly enclose the white, melancholy castle, except on the sea side, and had gone further still, through the years, branching out from that moment in time like the paths branching out in every direction from the park’s central fountain, and now they had reached me beyond the depths of time, echoing in vibrations of another kind—heart waves. Today, now... what does it mean? The eloquent speaker kept repeating that today and yesterday, now and tomorrow, before and after exist only in the brain, a capricious dictator that puts the before here and the after there. When, then, now? Forever, which is sometimes only a second, the White Rabbit says to Alice. Wonderland and behind the looking glass are everywhere, that is to say, forever, which has neither an end nor a beginning; there is no other place, no other instant. If things are as that professor was saying, as he will say, not only verb tenses but also temporal prepositions and adverbs should be abolished. Conformal field theory, geometric entities, before and after that exist only in the head—and, in this despotic head, a big muddle and great confusion. Now, Nori and I now... A bright smile on her face; the water flowing limpidly, clouds at the bottom of the sea, hearts transparent. The words expand until they embrace the vast sea behind the lecturer, the straight line of the horizon curves, the vault of the sky closes it.... If in space-time, according to the speaker, the sky is represented by a curved line rather than a straight line, in the case of large enough masses it can also be a closed curve or rather a circle. But then everything returns, everything is, and I have already been, I am already at the mouth of the Danube as I follow its waters to reach it. Yet Krems, at least for those approaching Vienna, comes after Dürnstein; Trieste, once Austrian, became Italian when the flags with the double eagle were taken down from the public buildings of the Adriatic coast in 1918; the Berlin Wall fell in 1989; and the Big Bang happened fourteen billion years ago, they say. A year is the time it takes the Earth to orbit around the Sun and a day the time it takes to rotate on its axis, but when there was neither Earth nor Sun what do years and days mean, what could exist and happen in those years that weren’t? In any case, over the years, wars began and ended—ended where? The scars are still there; tattoos engraved on the body throb under the skin, that of the world and of each of us. The globe is smooth, the hand strokes its polished, multicolored surface, under the blue of distant waters and islands there is bleeding and putrefaction. The meridians cut that sphere like orange wedges, the ship cuts the line that cuts through time. For a moment—what does that mean? no, not a moment, several minutes—the prow is on November25 and the stern on the26th, yes, no, the opposite. The date-change line, a love that advances and another that retreats—in time, of course, where if not? Can it be that love, too, is purely a convention like that line, that meridian that you can’t see, that isn’t there? Each meridian a wedge, same meridian same time in Trieste, Dresden, the Lofoten Islands, Luanda, Skeleton Coast Park. All the tips of every wedge come together at the South Pole as well as at the North Pole, all the times of the world together—at what time did Amundsen first set foot on the South Pole? It’s not true that time will be abolished, as the Apocalypse promises or threatens when speaking of the future, a verb tense, not the abolition of time but a proliferation mingling clashing of all possible and concurrent times; life—or death—is a whirling dust mote. Time or rather death. V.died in’96, no longer an adorable little girl but still a child even after years of illness that racked and twisted her without undermining her insuppressible dignity, the charisma of what she had been and therefore is forever. That date, a watershed of life, not just of hers, the sluice gate of a dam on the river that blocks the waters’ flow. V.is no more—what does that mean? Is Shakespeare perhaps no longer a poet but only was one and now isn’t anymore? What do his hardened arteries or who knows what other ailments have to do with his being a poet now and forever? And others, friends, male or female—friendship, another name for love, a fervent, risky walk together, loving is a gamble but it is forever, and therefore now.... Some friends no longer walk beside us, they have taken another road that leads elsewhere, although it’s not known where. Maybe they stayed a little ways behind, maybe they stopped at an osmiza to drink a few glasses of Terrano; before long I, too, will turn back or move on and I will find them. If there is some Terrano and prosciutto left they are certainly still there, there is more than one osmiza in which you are better off than in this world. If afterward (after what?), there were welcoming osmize rather than angels blowing trumpets in the clouds, it wouldn’t be so bad. Maybe there I could be a little more daring, after all, there the years don’t count—though when do they count?—and even an awkward boy might find the courage.... I never really spoke to Nori before that night in Rome and then only on the telephone. I wish I had; maybe there, on the other side, I would be less fearful, that fear that is always, more or less, present in these things, when they really matter. I wish I had spoken to her even before; had kissed her, and so kiss her... To love, synonymous with to be, a defective verb that only knows the present infinitive. Special conformal transformations—more than the conclusion of the lecture, they were practically an obsession on the part of the speaker at Miramare—project the points of space-time from the finite to infinity, in a diagram that Roger Penrose (apparently another one of those luminaries who explain how before and after function) terms the light cone at infinity. In this cone (he says, has said, will say), future and past times appear strictly equivalent to one and only one point. Eternal life, perhaps? So say those of another persuasion who claim to demonstrate something that can’t be seen, though at least they don’t claim to prove it like the Pythagorean theorem, whereas the professors, so cocksure and confident with their algorithms, logarithms, and black holes... and now LUCA too, our Last Universal Common Ancestor, ur ur ur forefather, the protobacterium, or maybe not, but in any case the oldest progenitor of all single and multicellular living beings, of all of us, including fungi and amoebas. What does it matter that no one has seen him? God too, no one has seen him either, even John the Apostle, the Beloved one, says so. No one has ever seen the black hole in which a star collapses, nor can you even say that first there was a star and then a black hole, because it is only the brain that plants a first here and an after there, and so if the brain is not there, even if it says so, the professor at Miramare proclaimed, there is no before or after, nothing, cosmic dust that does not exist, gnats that the aged eye sees hovering in the air but that are not there. The star shines white and collapses into a black hole, Nori’s hair is white and was, is—will be?—dark brown, no, not so dark, we’ll see. The professor who had a bone to pick with before and after was excited, delighted by the power that the hippocampus, that capricious seahorse nestled among the brain’s lobes, held over Cronos, over that deposed sovereign Time sitting on a throne like a rickety stool. For that matter, the professor with his Romagna accent was one of the most likable of all the ones we had to listen to, us raw recruits spurred on by the officers to slog away in the battle for life—I beg your pardon, for science. Eternal life, then? Yes, but here and now. It made an impression on me, hearing that said and written by the one they call His Holiness, who always seemed uncomfortable and awkward in his white garment but who nevertheless had the courage to be himself rather than the vicar of God. Well then, that man, that former successor of Christ, writes, wrote, eternal life now and forever but especially now, not an imaginary existence that carries on after death, an infinite continuation of yesterday, today, tomorrow, and who knows what, with punishments and rewards, as many faithful want to believe. This is eternal life, that they may know You—at least so said the one who proclaimed himself His son and said so just before he died. To know, to live the truth. True, authentic life, filled with meaning; lived also in time, in time illuminated by a value that cannot be destroyed by anything or anyone, nor altered by the flow of sand in the hourglass, swiftly inverted then always full again when it had seemed empty. Does forever mean living or dying? The hourglass’s chamber glows in the light that passes through it, tinged rusty gold when the hourglass is filled with sand and pale pinkish-yellow when it empties. Clear light in Nori’s immortal eyes, in that gaze that never ages. Fleeting life, eternal life; our contingencies, wrote that old poet among the cliffs and shores of Grado, mask the eternity of God; the wavelengths of light, numbers and fractions, become the blue of the sea, the red-violet of evening, the luminosity in Nori’s eyes. The opaque grain dies underground, the gold of the wheat stalk bends in the wind. Eternal leaf of the peepul tree, not far from Benares and the Ganges, under which a beggar prince dispelled the sorrow and fear of dying. In the dying leaf, he explains to the disciples, are the sun that warmed it, the cloud that quenched its thirst with rain, the land that nourished it; the leaf gives back the things and events that formed it and are, continue to be that leaf. Eternal impermanence, the eternity of everything. Eternal loss, eternal being; the blossom dies in the fruit, therefore it is the fruit, wrote a brilliant, occasionally pompous professor of Jena, demonstrating that even the greatest of philosophers can be a poet. You die and you become, said that poet of Weimar all the more poet than him, whose academic salary he increased, moreover, in his capacity as adviser to the Duchy, though sparingly. Die and become so that you really are, if you don’t want to remain a hurried, obscure guest in an impervious land. The oleanders in my garden—pink, white, red, every year others—the same. Afraid to die? King Aun the Elder you are not dead, the saga says, but have been resurrected in King Egil. Drink up, old king, life gives what you take. It is you who empties and refills the glass. Words—of whom, of others, of no one; words are like the air and the seasons, they don’t belong to anyone. Great confusion, too great for the small head that contains it. The universe in a walnut, so easy to crack, just slam it on the table with a little force. But in the meantime the kernel matures, it becomes more tender and tasty and even under the shell it understands and grasps something. I too now understand a little the paradox of the twins, the young one who aged, the one who went to live in a mountain lodge. Nori is younger than those her age who have not lived at the seaside as she has; she has the sea in her, maybe she doesn’t know it, she doesn’t remember when she was sea and sea creature, like everything that lives. Her years are the sprig of flowers she holds in her hand, sea poppies, I think, her eyes—I can’t see their color, but they’re light, luminous. In any case she is there, here, in the cone of light, a bright, ultramarine blue. From Malfa, offshore, behind the white of foamy crests in the boundless blue, you can see Panarea and Stromboli, black Stromboli, its beaches black; in Greek glaukós means blue but also, according to some later authors, an azure that darkens, a blue that is almost black but gleaming, eternal life in the light of that gaze. I had seen it in Krems, too, when... Future and past tenses, a single point, a single time... a present infinitive? Perhaps we perform in two cabarets, one linear and one circular, illuminated by light that shines down from the apex of the cone that Professor Penrose is so fond of. Many years ago, in Trieste, there was a cinema on Viale XX Settembre with two large screens in two adjacent theaters, separated only by a few steps leading to the rows and seats. The film was the same and the two screens were needed to accommodate the often large audience. From every seat in either theater you could see both screens, if you wanted to, one in front of you as usual and the other at an angle. The sequence of the film was the same on both screens. But nothing would have prohibited them from starting the projection on one screen half an hour earlier or half an hour later than on the other screen, so that different moments and events could be seen unfolding concurrently, the protagonist dying on one screen while battling and falling in love on the other, his story beginning or continuing after its end. Could this, or something like this, be the light cone at infinity in which there is neither temporal nor causal order, a region outside of time? Of course, I know very well that I am a point of ordinary space-time, a point that physicists and cosmologists would consider negligible. But some mathematicians may be treating me with instruments strictly intended for topological geometry; there’s no guarantee that a point is aware of the compass that draws it or the point set that starts from it, let alone the conformal transformations of the group that handles it inconsiderately. It may therefore be that, between that evening in Krems and that phone call from Rome, I was catapulted out of ordinary space-time into the region outside of time and then vice versa, because there is no doubt that at this moment my time is rectilinear, like the pen with which I am writing, an arrow racing without return toward the end, in the irreversible dissipative process that constitutes writing and life, afflictions of the mortal course. If the arts and sciences had their goddesses and Urania was the muse of the study of the stars, Nori could be the muse of transports, as Henri Poincaré calls the dynamics of those temporal shifts. There must indeed be a superior deity, because—the scientist in the park at Miramare informs us—no shift à la Poincaré, however large, transports us out of ordinary space-time, and for any physical system in ordinary space-time, infinite time and the speed of light are needed to reach the light cone at infinity, whereas what happened to me between Krems and the phone call from Rome took, modestly, only a few months. The transformation to the light cone at infinity, in the timeless region, is only possible for physical systems with no mass and, although I may consider myself satisfied with my still quite agile physique, I cannot deny having a mass. But perhaps I transported it back from the cone of light to that of shadow, and Nori, now, has never noticed me...

        "story": "Justine was twenty-one years old that spring, Jeffers, the age at which a person begins to show her true colors, and in many ways she was revealing herself to be not at all who I had believed her to be, while at the same time reminding me unexpectedly of other people I had known. I don’t think parents necessarily understand all that much about their children. What you see of them is what they can’t help being or doing, rather than what they intend, and it leads to all kinds of misapprehensions. Many parents, for instance, become convinced that their child has artistic talent, when that child has no intention whatever of becoming an artist! It’s all so many stabs in the dark, the business of trying to predict how a child will turn out—I suppose we do it to make bringing them up more interesting and to pass the time, the way a good story passes the time, when all that really matters is that afterward they’re able to go out into the world and stay there. I believe they know this themselves better than anyone. I was never very interested in the concept of filial duty, or in eliciting maternal tributes from Justine, and so we got to these essentials fairly quickly in our dealings with one another. I remember her asking me, when she was thirteen or so, what I believed the limits of my obligation to her were. “I believe I am obliged to let you go,” I said, once I’d thought about it, “but if that doesn’t work out, I believe I am obliged to remain responsible for you forever.” She sat silently for a while and then she nodded her head and said: “Good.” Because of events in our shared history I had come to see Justine as vulnerable and wounded, when in fact her key characteristic is her dauntlessness. As a small child she had shown this quality, and so perhaps it is truer to say, Jeffers, that we can consider our job as parents to have been accomplished without fatal error or wrongdoing when the small child becomes visible once more in the fully grown being. I have often considered the survival of paintings, and what it means for our civilization that an image has survived across time undamaged, and something of the morality of that survival—the survival of the original—pertains, I believe, to the custody of human souls too. There was a period in which I lost Justine and during which I will never know precisely what happened to her, and it was for signs of damage from this time that I was always on the alert. I told her this around the time that we had the conversation about obligation. I told her that she had lost a year of the care she was owed by me, and that she could consider it a formal debt, to be reclaimed at any time. I even wrote an IOU out for her on a piece of paper! She laughed at me for it, though not unkindly, and I was never handed back that piece of paper, but when she and Kurt returned from Berlin to live with us, it did occur to me that she was perhaps calling in what I owed her. She had become somewhat of a stranger to me in her time away, and just as a familiar place can seem smaller and clearer when you return there after an absence, and any changes quite shocking at first, I found her somehow distilled, as well as in certain ways startlingly altered. Change is also loss, and in that sense a parent can lose a child every day, until you realize that you’d better stop predicting what they’re going to become and concentrate on what is right in front of you. In that period her small, sturdy physique had suddenly matured, and acquired a density and agility that brought to mind an acrobat: she seemed full of a pent-up but expertly balanced energy, as though at any minute she might whirl exultantly up into the air. Yet likewise when she had no direction or nothing to do she could assume an awful flaccidity, like an acrobat who has somehow got herself stranded down on the ground. She had dismayed me by cutting off all her hair, and had taken to wearing squarish smocks and workaday clothes that stood in stark contrast to her physical ebullience, as well as to the splendor of Kurt’s own wardrobe. I suspected that she was engaged in the pointless squandering of her femininity, and perhaps because I secretly feared I was somewhere to blame for it, I was tempted to lay this wastage at Kurt’s door. The image of middle-aged dullness they formed seemed like something he, rather than she, had summoned up and was doing rather well out of, and I was frequently shocked by little put-downs and criticisms he would deliver to her in a quiet voice, the way parents sometimes lower their voices to criticize their children in front of other people, as a way of burnishing themselves. Yet Justine was slavish in her treatment of him, and would become quite frantic if his needs or expectations were frustrated by a particular turn of events, which meant that I was always slightly nervous while living at close quarters with them in the main house, lest I inadvertently be the cause of the frustration. Privately, I interpreted Justine’s conduct as the unmediated product of her feelings about her father, around whom I myself had once been nervous and slavish too, and in fact I had found myself beginning to substitute Kurt for him quite naturally. One morning I was sitting beside Justine while she was looking for something in her purse, and a small photograph fell out. I picked it up and saw a close-up image of her with her father, whom I had not seen in person for several years. Their heads were resting together and their arms were around one another’s necks and they both looked very happy, and I was so astonished that I couldn’t even feel envy or insecurity, just simple admiration! “What a lovely picture of you with your dad,” I said to her, and jumped out of my skin when she screeched with laughter in my ear. “That’s Kurt!” she said, cackling and stuffing the photo back in her purse. Later she told Kurt about it and they laughed again over the idea that I had mistaken him for her father, though I was gradually becoming aware that the misapprehension ran deeper in me than either of them realized. Whenever Tony asked Kurt to help outside, for instance, I would feel a protest leap immediately into my throat, as though I believed that Kurt should be shielded from discomfort and labor. I had believed the same thing of Justine’s father, at one time, which shows how little we are able to truly change ourselves. Yet Justine herself didn’t object to these requests, and the reason she didn’t was because it was Tony who had made them, as I discovered when I myself once casually asked Kurt to help clear the dishes from the table and was treated to flounces and glares from Justine. I’m generally suspicious when people are said to “adore” other people, especially when they’ve been given no choice over who those people are, but Justine did always seem to have taken to Tony right from the start and to have trusted him; and Tony, I believe, could not have loved Justine more had she been his own daughter. Most people are incapable of that disinterested kind of love, but Tony has no biological children and no blood relatives, and can love who he likes. He was determined, in any case, that Kurt should lend a hand and occupy himself. When I told him, mortified, about my mix-up over the photograph, he stopped what he was doing and stood as still as an alligator with his eyelids half-closed for the longest time, and I saw that the similarity between my choice of Justine’s father and Justine’s choice of Kurt had been evident to him all along. That first morning after L and Brett’s arrival, Jeffers, when I stood and talked to L beside the boat, marked the beginning of a period of unseasonably hot weather. It was spring, which ordinarily is a time of turbulent change, when wind and sun and rain alternate to clear away the winter and germinate the new things. Instead we received day after day of inexplicable stillness and heat, and the first flowers rushed up out of the raw earth and the trees hastily put on their foliage. Walking on the marsh, I noted dry paths that usually would have been boggy with mud, and clouds of buzzing insects everywhere, and the air shrilled and pulsed with birdsong as never before, as though all these creatures had been summoned up from the earth to some great and mysterious appointment ahead of time. It was so dry that Tony grew worried some of the young trees and plants might die for lack of spring rain, and so he started to build an irrigation system out of long lengths of rubber hose that he laid all around our land. It had so many circuits and junctions that it resembled a huge network of veins, and he had to pierce all the hoses with hundreds of tiny holes along their sides so that the water would come out in continuous drips. It was fiddly and laborious work and it took him many hours, and I got used to seeing him at a distance, now in one corner of the land and now in another, bent over in concentration. After a while he conscripted Kurt to help him, and then there were two tiny figures in the distance, bending and conferring while the sun shone down on their heads. Every now and again I would bring them something to drink, and it took them forever to notice I was there, while they puzzled out the mechanics of some complicated junction or tried to work out why water wasn’t flowing down a particular tributary. They couldn’t afford to be slapdash or careless: the smallest mistake would result in the failure of the whole system. Tony had planted most of those trees himself and he cared about each one. How arduous and time-consuming it is, Jeffers, to take care of every last thing and not deceive yourself and wave away some aspect of it! I suppose the writing of a poem must work along similar lines. Kurt was willing enough to do the work at first, but after a while I could see that he was growing bored of it. He was relying on his good manners and on the mild discipline of his privileged upbringing to carry him along, rather than on the mania of the perfectionist or the tenacity of the dutiful soldier. His character—that of a cherished, well-trained house dog—struggled to accommodate this turn of events, in which it was hard to discern a narrative wherein he played the central role, and since he was exhausted by the end of the day in any case, he retreated into a kind of dazed blankness, as though he had received a sort of concussion to his sense of self-importance. The hiatus gave Justine a desire to experiment with her own power, for which Brett was ready and willing to provide the opportunity. “Brett is such an interesting person,” Justine said to me one afternoon, when she had gone to get supplies for the second place and taken an unusually long time returning. “Did you know that she danced in the London ballet, all the time that she was putting herself through medical school?” I had no idea that Brett had been to medical school, nor that she was a trained dancer. All I knew was that at this current moment she was lodged like a giant splinter in my life, and that I had no idea how or when I was going to prize her out again. Because of the unusually fine weather, in the evenings Tony would light the fire in the big brazier outside at dusk, so that we could sit and watch the sun set over the sea while the coolness of night came in. I would watch the smoke roll up into the sky, knowing that L could see it from the second place and hoping it would draw him to us. Up until then I had barely seen L, and any questions or requests from that household came through Brett, so that it couldn’t have been made clearer to me that he was hiding. Each night Tony built the fire bigger and bigger, as if he had read my mind and was trying to help summon L himself. On the fourth or fifth night, just as darkness was about to fall, I finally saw the two of them winding their way through the shadows of the trees toward us. We all jumped up to welcome them and made room around the fire. I can’t remember what we talked about, just that I was aware of L’s lamplike eyes growing brighter and more penetrating as the dusk fell, like the eyes of some nocturnal animal—and also that he had made sure to sit as far away from me as he could possibly get. We had a cocktail of some sort in a big jug which we were sharing around, but L didn’t drink his: he accepted a portion, so as not to draw attention to himself, I suppose, and I found it afterward, untouched. He never drank alcohol in the time that I knew him, at least that I saw. We always like to have a good drink at the day’s end, Jeffers, and go to bed sleepy and not too late, along with the birds—it seems to suit our way of life here. So L’s alertness in the darkness was unnerving. I was happy, though, to be in his presence, or more accurately, it was pleasant for an hour or two not to have to puzzle over what his absence meant. But then after that first time he didn’t come again. He stayed at home, while Brett came tripping and calling through the glade to sit in a circle with us every night, usually next to Justine. Kurt, after his day spent with the hosepipes, would be nodding in sleep in front of the brazier before he was halfway through his first cocktail: we woke him up to eat his dinner but he mostly crept off to bed by nine. This left Justine at a loose end, and Brett was right there to pick it up. And so the fire by which I had hoped to summon what I wanted ended by summoning the very thing I didn’t want, which was more of Brett’s company! I had treated Brett with a cordial wariness whenever we chanced to meet, but now she began to spend more time in the main house, and I saw that I would have to find a more serviceable manner for dealing with her. One afternoon I was passing Justine’s room, and behind the closed door I heard the two of them talking and laughing inside. When I saw Justine later, her short hair was done in a new—and far more flattering—style, and she wore a bright scarf tied around her head that framed her pretty face quite strikingly. “Brett’s persuaded me to grow my hair,” she said, slightly shamefaced, for I had been dropping hints on that score for weeks. And indeed she did grow out her hair, Jeffers, all through the spring and summer, and by the autumn her lovely dark curls were falling almost to her shoulders, though by then Kurt was no longer there to see them. Soon she and Brett were always together, and since they weren’t, I reasoned, all that far apart in age, I somewhat grudgingly supposed it was natural for them to become friends, despite being such different characters. In fact Brett was considerably older, as I discovered later, which might explain why Justine fell under her influence, rather than the other way around—to good effect, I must admit, at least as far as her appearance was concerned. “What on earth is this?” Brett would say, as I myself didn’t dare to, when she discovered Justine in one of those sacklike garments she had taken to wearing. “Did it come from Mother Hubbard’s cupboard?” A “Mother Hubbard” was that loose kind of dress certain Victorian ladies used to wear that covered them from top to toe, to avoid having to put on a corset—Brett’s comparison was an exaggeration, but it wasn’t far off! Brett herself, of course, showed off her lovely figure at every opportunity. I believed, I suppose, that Justine’s concealment of herself and her embracing of the cult of plainness and comfort was the result of her shame and self-dislike, and the reason I believed it was because it was what I had always felt myself. At heart I feared I had failed to do something vital with respect to Justine’s womanhood, or worse, had inadvertently done to her the same thing that had been done to me. I had grown up disgusted by my physical self, regarding femininity as a device—like the corset—to keep the repellent facts from view: it was as impossible for me to accept what was ugly in myself as to accept any other kind of ugliness. A woman such as Brett, therefore, unnerved me deeply, not only because she relished self-exposure but because I sensed she was thereby capable—without especial malice—of exposing other people. So when one day in the kitchen she crept up behind Justine and, laughing, grabbed her smock by the hem and whipped it over her head, so that there in the kitchen my daughter’s young body was revealed in its underwear for all the world to see, I was rather too ready to prove that Brett’s game was up. “How dare you!” I cried, which was what I had wanted to say to her since the day we had met. “Who do you think you are?” Justine was emitting muffled shrieks, which I soon understood were indicative of laughter, but all the same I was furious and upset, just as if it had been my own flesh that Brett had unveiled so mercilessly. “I’m sorry,” Brett said, putting her pretty, remorseful face too close to mine and her conciliatory hand on my arm. “Was that too high-spirited?” “We’re not all exhibitionists here,” I said, spitefully. Justine, however, wasn’t angry with Brett at all after the incident, and even allowed herself to be called Mother Hubbard on occasion, which I privately fumed at until I realized one day that the sackcloths were no longer in evidence and that my daughter was undergoing a transformation. I came out of the house into the bright sunlight one afternoon and saw two figures sitting on the grass, and for a moment I didn’t seem to know either of them—two fresh and laughing young women, their limbs bared to the sun, like a pair of nymphs in the dawn of the world who had alighted on our lawn! “Brett wants to teach me to sail,” Justine said soon afterward. “Do you think Tony would let us use the boat?” “You’d better ask him yourself,” I said. “Are you sure she really knows what to do? It’s not like motor-boating on the Mediterranean out there. I think he’d be worried.” “She once sailed single-handed across the Atlantic!” Justine burst out when I made these objections. “They even put on an exhibition in New York of the photos she took of the journey!” Well, I could barely stop myself from unmasking Brett as a fantasist there and then, and forcing Justine to acknowledge the outlandish nature of her claims about her own life, but it seemed reasonable enough to expect that the facts would come to light on their own. I left it to Tony to shine that pitiless torch on Brett, and I felt secretly guilty that I had allowed Justine to become attached to someone who lied and aggrandized herself, as well as chagrined to remember that it was L who had brought her uninvited into our midst. “She can do it,” Tony very much surprised me by saying, after I had forced him to go and talk to Brett about sailing the boat. “She’s got the certificate. She showed it to me.” This was an international qualification, Jeffers, that apparently enabled the holder to skipper large yachts anywhere in the world. Our old wooden dinghy barely counted! Justine had always loved going out on that boat with Tony, though she had resisted his own attempts to teach her how to sail it. I think it would be true to say that she wasn’t sure the adults in her life could teach her anything, not even Tony. But also she couldn’t see the point of learning, she had said, since she would be unlikely ever to keep a boat of her own, and Kurt had seemed to reinforce that outlook, in which fear masqueraded as common sense or even disdain. I could almost see him thinking that if Justine learned to sail, she might one day just get in a boat and sail away from him! In this and other ways she and Kurt had seemed to be turning their backs on risk and adventure. But now I saw her begin to rebel against these prescriptions, even as I had privately resigned myself to them and to the future in which they had promised to confine her. What I am trying to say, Jeffers, is that in watching Justine begin to separate herself from Kurt and question his control over her, I was in the strangest sense watching her overtake me, as though we were running a race, at different points in time but over the same terrain, and in the place where I had catastrophically fallen she leaped with superior skill and strength and ran on. The resemblance I saw between Kurt and her father was a striking product of my unconscious mind, because I was frightened of the latter and therefore saw him as something menacing and large, whereas Kurt I dismissed as clinging and weak. But Kurt wasn’t weak: men never are. Some of them admit their strength and use it to the good, and some of them are able to make their will to power seem attractive, and some of them resort to deception and connivance to manage a selfishness of which they are themselves somewhat frightened. If Kurt was weak, in other words, then so had Justine’s father been, and this was what the incident with the photograph had revealed to me. So much of power lies in the ability to see how willing other people are to give it to you. What I had dismissed as weakness in Kurt was the same force that had ravaged my life all those years before, and which even now I had only recognized by mistake. Those first weeks of L’s visit, while Tony laid the irrigation system and Brett trespassed into our lives and the hot weather held us in a kind of thrall, had a quality of intermission or interval, and the changes that occurred were like the changes of costume and scenery that go on backstage. And there was I, an audience of one in the stalls: it felt, almost, as though I were looking at it all through the wrong end of a telescope and seeing things from a greater distance than I usually did, perhaps because I myself was not especially the focus of anyone’s attention. These periods can feel like intimations of death, until one remembers that it is the presence of the audience that allows the whole show to be put on in the first place. But I was aware of an empty seat next to mine, where L should have been: I felt we could have watched and understood together. My disappointment and my sorrow were held in check by the hope that soon he might reveal himself. Because Tony was so busy with the hosepipes he didn’t have time to plant out the spring seedlings in the vegetable garden, and so I had to offer to do it myself, even though I dislike having to do work of this kind. This isn’t out of laziness, but rather the feeling that my life has entailed too many practical tasks, so that if I add even one more to the total, the balance will be tipped and I will have to admit I have failed to live as I have always wished to. The trouble lay in finding anything to put on the other side of the scales: I was quite capable, as I have said, of spending all my free time just sitting and staring in front of me. And yet the second anyone asked me to go and do something, I immediately felt oppressed! Tony understood this about me entirely, and hardly ever expected me to move a muscle, and the only thing that irked him was that I couldn’t expend more of this need for inactivity in sleep and in mental passivity. I always sprang out of bed in the morning, careening around full of energy and will and quite capable of building Rome in a day, only this other part of me wouldn’t let me do it. Tony slept deeply and long, and when he rose he carried the balance of his pleasures and his duties along with him, so that he never strained any one part of himself with too much of either. I would watch him in fascination, Jeffers, trying to learn. He made and ate his breakfast with excruciating slowness, while I wolfed mine down like an animal, so that it was gone long before I had stopped feeling hungry. He would go to an immense amount of trouble over certain things that filled me only with impatience, like the broken old radio I had wanted to throw away but he was determined to fix, even though we had replaced it with a new one. He spent the longest time over it, and for a while our kitchen table was covered with all the parts, and then just as we had started to argue over it, it disappeared. A few days later I had to go and tell him something while he was down at the field on his tractor, and as I approached across the grass I distinctly heard an aria from Handel’s Alcina pealing out over the noise of the engine. He had installed the machine in his tractor, so that he could listen to music while he drove up and down! Tony believed that I had done more than my fair share of work, and that what was required of me now in my life with him was to enjoy myself, but what he hadn’t reckoned with was the difficulty of finding pleasure and enjoyment for someone who has never really valued them. He thought I should take pride in what I had survived and what I had achieved, and go around like a sort of queen bee, but meanwhile I had come to view the world as far too dangerous a place in which to stop and congratulate myself. The truth was I had always assumed that pleasure was being held in store for me, like something I was amassing in a bank account, but by the time I came to ask for it I discovered the store was empty. It appeared that it was a perishable entity, and that I should have taken it a little earlier. What I wanted now was work or distraction of a meaningful kind, but try as I might, I couldn’t find meaning in those seedlings! Nonetheless I put on my old boots and found the trowel and rake, and with much sighing I trudged down to the vegetable beds to begin my task. Just as I was unloading the trays of little green shoots from the wheelbarrow, who should appear by my side but Brett, all fresh and lovely in a primrose-yellow dress, with silver sandals on her feet that offered the greatest possible contrast to the muddy, ogreish affairs on mine. “Need a hand?” she said cheerfully. “L’s in a foul mood this morning, so I thought I’d better make myself scarce.” Well, Jeffers, with all my irritation over Brett’s presence and my feeling of being imposed upon, I admit I hadn’t thought once about how it might be for her to be stuck out here among strangers, sharing a confined space with a man of famed intractability to whom her relationship was unclear. I’m not the kind of woman who intuitively understands or sympathizes with other women, probably because I don’t understand or sympathize all that much with myself. Brett had seemed to me to have everything, and yet in that moment I saw in a flash that she had nothing at all, and that her intrusive and uninhibited manner was simply her means of survival. She was like one of those climbing plants that has to grow over things and be held up by them, rather than possessing an integral support of her own. “That’s good of you,” I said, “but I wouldn’t want your nice clothes to get dirty.” “Oh, don’t worry about that,” she said. “It’s a relief to get dirty sometimes.” She picked up the trowel and squatted down beside the trays of seedlings. “If we dig a little trench,” she said, “it will make it easier.” I was quite happy to let her take charge, and I sat back on my heels while she made a low trench very deftly and neatly all along the bed. I asked her whether L was often bad-tempered, and she stopped what she was doing to throw her head back melodramatically and laugh. “Do you know what he says? He says he’s going through the change!” “The change? Like a woman?” “That’s what he says. Except I don’t think women actually use that word anymore.” I found this idea quite interesting, Jeffers, despite Brett’s laughing at it: it seemed to me like something that might well happen to a creative artist, where a loss or alteration in the sources of potency had occurred. Oh, the bitter feeling of release from one’s service to blood and fate! To be led and then discarded by one’s urges: Why should an artist not feel it more than anyone? “If you ask me,” Brett said, “it’s everything else that’s changing, not him. He preferred it like it was before. He’s sulking, that’s all. He wants back all the things he pretended to take for granted.” The art market had completely collapsed, she went on, after years of crazed overvaluing, so there were a lot of people in the same boat as L—and far worse, because they didn’t have his pedigree. But there were others—a small number—whose reputations and fortunes were surviving unharmed. “Some of them happen to be younger than him,” she said, “and a different color, and a couple of them are actually women, which adds to his feeling that the world is against him. The trouble is, he feels impotent.” “But he is somebody,” I said. Brett lightly shrugged her shoulders. “I think he was settling in for a long and luxurious retirement as an artistic eminence. He has a lot of rich friends,” she added, in a low voice. “It would have taken him a whole year just to visit them all, and by the time he’d finished he’d be ready to go back and see the first one again. Most of them were heavy investors in his work, and if he paid them a call now, they’d all be sitting staring at walls that have had ninety percent of their value wiped off them. I believe,” she went on, nimbly lifting the seedlings from their trays and starting to stand them in a line down the trench, “this might be the best possible thing for him. To be stripped down to nothing again. He’s too young just to sit drinking martinis by someone else’s swimming pool.” I asked her how old she was herself. “I’m thirty-two,” she said, grinning, “but you have to swear not to tell anyone.” She told me that she had met L through her rich cousin, the same one who had flown them here. “He’s an awful creep,” she said. “He used to shut me in a cupboard at family parties when I was little and put his hands up my dresses. He looks like a sea monster now. But he became a collector, as they all do. They have so little imagination, they don’t know what else to do with their money. It’s funny, isn’t it, how determined they are to prove that the thing that can’t be bought can in fact be bought after all. I actually first met L at his house, and then later I persuaded him to buy a whole tranche of sketches L had sitting around in his studio, and since he knows nothing about art he was happy to pay far too much for them and then fly us here into the bargain. That’s all the money L has,” she added, “for now.” “And what about you?” I said, rather aghast at all this. “Oh, I’ve always had money. A lot of it’s gone, of course, but I have enough. That’s been my problem. No motivation.” She grimaced and made quote marks with her fingers as she spoke the words. “I was drawn to L because he seemed so bitter and angry and rebellious, and I hardly ever meet people like that in the world I live in. I didn’t ask myself what he was doing there in that world himself!” She told me how much she liked Justine. “She has so much honesty,” she said. “Did you make her like that?” I said I didn’t know. I’d certainly always been honest with her, but that wasn’t quite the same thing. “People can get tired of too much honesty,” I said. “It makes them want to cover things up again.” “It certainly does!” Brett said. “By the time I was eleven, I was so tired of people showing me things they pretended weren’t for my eyes, I decided to become a nun! I was always deciding to be things—I think I did it in the hope of finding something I couldn’t do.” She asked me how I’d met Tony and come to live out here, and I told her the story and about how it had happened entirely by chance. It was a strange thing, I said, to live a life that had no connection whatever to anything you’d ever done or been. There was no thread that led to Tony, and no path between here and where I was before, and so my knowledge of it and of him had to come from an entirely different source. There was a place not too far away, I told her, a sort of archipelago where the sea has made these great fissures in the land, and on opposite banks of one of these very long and narrow bodies of water there are two villages that face one another. It would take literally hours to get by road from one to the other, going miles and miles inland and then coming back out again, yet they can see one another so clearly, right down to the clothes hanging on their washing lines! Something of that separation, I said, which was composed not of distance but of impassibility, illustrated my own situation: I was more familiar with what I looked at than with where I actually was, and so I knew exactly what it would have been like to be over there, looking across at here. What I wasn’t so sure of was what here looked like. But I knew I was lucky to have met Tony. “It’s frightening to live on luck,” Brett said, somewhat wistfully. Then she asked me, straight out, if I thought I was in love with L! “No,” I said, though the truth was, Jeffers, that I had been starting to wonder the same thing myself. “I just want to know him.” “Oh,” she said. “I wondered what it was.” “Are you in love with him?” I asked. “I’m just a pal,” she said, dusting the earth off her hands and putting the empty trays back in the wheelbarrow. “He was really crazy about me for a while. I think he thought I could fix him sexually, but I can’t. He’s all finished in that department. Instead I’m getting him to teach me to paint. He says I’ve got some ability. I think that’s going to be my next career!” Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. is the author of many books, most recently the Outline trilogy.

        "story": "The saleswoman was waiting for them as they entered the store. She had severely dyed hair and a clipboard clutched tightly to her chest. Josh thought it was possibly her first day. He stood a little back, behind his wife, and silent. She was still his wife for another week, maybe two. It’d been her idea to come here after their meeting at Denny’s. They were just supposed to meet for lunch. Now here they were, still together, shopping. “How did you hear about us?” the saleswoman said. She had a toothy grin, a lot of gum visible. “Radio ad,” his wife answered. His wife was wearing her leopard-print skirt. It was what you call a conversation piece. That’s what she’d told him at Denny’s. “Every time I wear it, someone comments on it,” she’d said. “People from all walks of life. A man on a bike in the Target parking lot even. I don’t get it; it’s just an inexpensive cotton skirt. It’s like wearing a pair of jeans.” In another story she told him at Denny’s, she’d said she didn’t understand a man at the Elks club in her hometown saying of her, “Here comes Miss Ohio!” “At first I thought it was a compliment. But then, very quickly, after thirty seconds or so, I thought, no, it’s an insult. He’s insulting me.” She’d had her usual Fit Slam in front of her: egg white omelet with spinach and cherry tomatoes, a dry English muffin, turkey bacon, and a bowl of fruit. He’d ordered a breaded chicken sandwich with bacon. Fries and mayo. He wasn’t sure what to make of her stories. She’d waited until July, until he was all the way across the country in Portland visiting his family, to tell him she’d gone to see an attorney. That was all there was to it, she’d said over the phone, other than for him to sign some papers. She added this last part rather nonchalantly. Earlier in the phone call, she’d been sobbing. Right when he’d answered. She had barely been able to get the words out at first. He’d been about to go for a run with Bret, his college buddy, the guy he was staying with. Then, very quickly, he had realized Bret was going to have to go without him. He wasn’t going to be running anywhere that day. At first he thought he might not sign. “If you won’t sign,” his wife had said after a few days went by, “we’ll have to hire one of those men who serve papers, like in a movie from the Nineties.” He couldn’t remember what movie she was talking about, though he didn’t doubt there was one. For two weeks he imagined a man in a dark suit and sunglasses hiding behind every building and bush, waiting to jump out at him. But after a while it seemed like this wasn’t going to happen. Eventually, he opened the email from his wife’s attorney, printed the papers, and signed and scanned them. Then his wife seemed happy. What brings you in?” the saleswoman said, the clipboard still at her chest, her grin still gummy. She looked to be in her fifties. A late career, maybe. Maybe a divorce. “Mattresses,” his wife said, walking toward the beds on the right side of the store. To the left were various configurations of mismatched furniture: big pleather sofas with trays and cup holders in the arms. Enormous wooden coffee tables. Brass lamps. Everything looked a decade or two out of fashion, as though it could have been used on the set of a working-class sitcom from Josh’s youth. He imagined sitting on one of the sofas, placing a beer in the cup holder, watching a football game on TV while his sitcom wife was in the kitchen, cooking him dinner, making sarcastic comments as he watched. It didn’t feel much different than dreaming. “Remember? This used to be a Toys‘R’Us,” his wife had said as they pulled into the parking lot. “But young people aren’t having babies anymore—at least that’s what I read somewhere—and they closed all the stores.” He did have some vague memory of coming here with her when it was still a Toys“R”Us, though he could no longer remember why. There had been a very brief window when they thought of having kids, and then the window had closed and they hadn’t thought about it since. “Now you could meet a younger woman, have a whole new family of your own,” his wife had said. It was supposed to be some sort of a pep talk, he gathered, this business about a younger woman, a new family, babies. His wife’s son was grown now, though he’d been young when they met: in second or third grade, he couldn’t remember. His wife was nine years older than he was, though no one thought so. Most people thought she was younger. But that didn’t change the biology of the situation. “It’s so unfair that Alec Baldwin can have a whole ’nother family in his fifties, pop out five new babies with a wife twenty years younger, just like that,” she’d said, snapping her fingers, on more than one occasion. It was like she was working out a stand-up routine. “You can be just like Alec Baldwin now,” she’d told him in the car, more of her strange pep talk, even though he knew she resented Alec Baldwin and his younger, yoga pants–wearing wife. “Are you a stomach sleeper, a side sleeper, or back?” the saleswoman asked his wife. They were both tagging along after her, the saleswoman and then Josh. “I don’t know, all three?” his wife said. “Well, what do you start out on?” the saleswoman asked. “I don’t know—stomach?” his wife said. “So you like it firm then,” the saleswoman said. “Yes, that’s what I want: I want firm,” his wife said. “What about you?” the saleswoman said. Suddenly, she was looking at him. “What do you like?” He started to say something, then changed his mind. “It doesn’t matter. Whatever she likes,” he said, gesturing toward his wife, her leopard-print skirt. “Ohhh, you’re a lucky woman!” the saleswoman said, more gums—equine, really. His wife smiled, first at the saleswoman, then at him. She had her hand on a mattress, was pressing on it, testing it, before she sat down. She kept smiling at him. He was unsure what the smiling meant, how to interpret it. He’d been wrong before. “Go ahead and lay down on it the way you would at home,” the saleswoman said. “Lay on your stomach.” His wife shook her head. “I don’t want to lie on my stomach,” his wife said. Instead, she lay—arms at her sides, heels together—on her back. “How does it feel?” the saleswoman asked. “Good. It feels firm,” his wife said. “You try it now,” the saleswoman said to Josh. He went and sat on the opposite side of the bed. He couldn’t remember the last time he and his wife had been in bed together. She barely moved when he sat down. The mattress was firm, indeed. “Nice, huh?” the saleswoman said. It was unclear to whom she was speaking. There were so many ways it was nice. He was trying not to get reacquainted with any of them. “What type of mattress do you have?” his wife asked, turning toward him. “This kind, this brand,” he said. “But a step down, a step less firm.” “And you like it?” his wife said. “Yeah, I like it a lot,” he said. He could feel the saleswoman’s eyes on them. He realized neither of them was wearing a wedding ring. His was in a zippered compartment of his suitcase. He was afraid to ask his wife what she’d done with hers. He remembered the story of how she’d flung her first one into the ocean when she realized that marriage was over. She’d been driving over a bridge in California. Or was it Florida? It might have been Michigan. Not that it mattered now. “So, what do you think?” the saleswoman asked. “I like it,” his wife said, sitting up. “This is the one I want.” “Okay,” the saleswoman said. “It comes with the box spring, of course.” “Oh, I don’t need the box spring,” his wife said. “Are you sure? It’s free. It comes with it,” the saleswoman said. “My bed’s one of those platform types,” his wife said, and he realized she meant their bed, his bed, the one she no longer slept in. It had drawers underneath. He kept his socks in the drawers on his side. He’d always been a little afraid to open the drawers on his wife’s side. “Oh, then you don’t need a box spring,” the saleswoman said, agreeing. “But he might,” his wife said, nodding toward Josh. “Do you have bed frames too? He might need a bed frame.” “Yeah, I might as well take the box spring,” Josh said. “If it’s free.” “Yes, of course,” the saleswoman said. “We have several bed frames back here, and most of them are currently on sale.” They followed the saleswoman to the back of the store, where four or five beds in a row were made up to look like they were in someone’s home. “This one reminds me of the frame I had with my waterbed years ago,” Josh said, pointing to one with a mirrored headboard and wood someone had painted blue. “You had a waterbed?” his wife said. “I didn’t know you had a waterbed. Sounds kinky.” “I was in high school,” Josh said. “Oh, what about this one? This one looks like you,” his wife said, pointing to the most minimal option. The wood was brown, wood colored. It didn’t have any mirrors or drawers. “Yeah, I like that one,” Josh said. “And it’s on sale for two hundred today,” the saleswoman said. She had been standing a little to the side and now she stepped forward. “We’ll take this bed frame too,” his wife said. His wife was used to making decisions. She had her credit card ready. “And these will all be going to the same address?” the saleswoman asked. “No, two different addresses,” his wife said. “The mattress to one and the bed frame and box spring to another.” “Hmm. If you have them both sent to one address, the delivery is free,” the saleswoman said, chewing the end of her pen. “We could maybe do that,” his wife said. “I’ll have the U-Haul twenty-four hours,” Josh said. “Okay, let me get my computer,” the saleswoman said. While the saleswoman was gone, they walked around the store, looking at furniture and talking. “She can’t figure us out,” his wife said, sitting on one of the pleather couches, fingering the cup holder. “Yeah, she must have thought one thing when we walked in the store and something else now,” he said. “Who knows what she thinks,” his wife said, kicking out the footrest. “It’s unclear,” he said. “Good,” his wife said. “Give her something to talk about.” Josh didn’t bother mentioning how things felt unclear to him, too. Instead, he remained standing, leaning a little on a large lamp as he’d seen men in old black-and-white films lean on lampposts. “Do you need a lamp?” his wife asked. She was sort of squinting at him now, as though trying to figure something out. “No, I’m just leaning,” Josh said. “I see,” his wife said. She’d stopped squinting. He was stopping by the house so they could walk around and point out things he wanted to take and things he didn’t. His friend Luke was going to help him move the larger items the next day while his wife was at her friend Victoria’s house on the lake: the couch and ottoman, the older mattress, a bookshelf. Tomorrow was Labor Day. He tried not to remember the Labor Days they’d spent at the lake together, with her son and her son’s Boston Terrier, but he remembered them anyway. He remembered throwing her son into the water, swimming beside his wife out to an anchored dock. He remembered the Boston Terrier almost drowning, his wife begging him to jump in after it. “I’m going to stop and get a decaf coffee on my way home,” his wife was saying. They were still in his car, driving back from the furniture store. They’d left her car at Denny’s. “Do you want to go with me or drop me back at Denny’s?” “I’ll go with you,” he said. They walked around the store like they used to—through all the familiar aisles—getting her coffee. “I think I’m going to get some cookies too. Do you want any cookies?” his wife said. They were standing in front of a large case that contained many different kinds of cookies: raspberry, butterscotch, chocolate chip. “No, I don’t think so,” he said. “Oh, come on, what are you trying to prove?” his wife said. He had to think. He wasn’t sure he was trying to prove anything. But that didn’t mean his wife was wrong. “I just don’t understand why we can’t be friends,” his wife was saying. She’d been using that word all day. She kept repeating the bit about not understanding. It was hard to tell if she was being genuine or not. She kept comparing them to a famous actress and the famous actress’s ex-husband, a famous singer. “They still do stuff together,” she’d said back at Denny’s. “They’re still good friends.” He kept saying he didn’t think he wanted to be friends, but she kept insisting that they could be. “Okay,” he said. “I’ll get a couple cookies.” “That’s more like it,” his wife said, filling a plastic bag with three or four cookies, then handing it to him. “What about some beer?” she said after that. “Yeah, I’ll drink a beer,” he said. “You will?” his wife said. She seemed surprised, even though it was her idea. “Sure,” he said. He shrugged his shoulders. “What kind should we get?” she asked. There were stouts and IPAs and pilsners, and all of them had clever names and labels made by clever graphic designers. “Whatever you want,” he said, which was probably the wrong thing to say. She often complained about his lack of decisiveness. Though what did it matter now? “How about this one?” She was smiling and holding up something called Dragon’s Milk. “Sure,” he said. What did it matter now? Back at the house, he was holding one of the beers as they walked from room to room. His wife had poured a small amount of the beer from his bottle into an old-fashioned glass and was sipping it as they walked. There was a new Boston Terrier—two years old—and she followed them around. Originally, they had said they would share the Boston Terrier like a child, but now that seemed almost impossible. The logistics of it. Probably his wife would have her all the time. At one point Josh saw the cat sleeping on a chair in the guest room. The cat was seventeen and was going to have to be put down soon. Something else they would have to face together; he would have to dig a hole. “What about this chair? And this lamp? And this cabinet?” His wife was pointing at pieces of furniture. She had a pen and a pad of sticky notes in her hand. The cabinet was a liquor cabinet she’d given him for some holiday years ago, but there was no liquor in it now—just the conversational napkins someone had given him for some birthday or other. Some had Boston Terriers on them. Some had sayings about drinking that were supposed to be funny, though he’d never found them to be particularly funny. “Yes,” he said. “I’ll take all of those.” “I got rid of all the liquor when you left for the summer,” his wife said. “I was worried I was becoming an alcoholic.” “But you barely drink,” he said. “Around people,” his wife said. “Anyway, I guess that’s everything. I thought there was more.” “That’s all the big stuff,” he said. “Just the towels and plates and stuff like that are left.” “We don’t need to put sticky notes on those,” his wife said. “No,” he said. “You just tell me what to take and I’ll take it.” This was the second apartment he’d gotten since they married. Five years earlier it had looked as though they would get divorced, but they hadn’t. They’d lived apart for two years, and then when the old Boston Terrier died, his wife had asked him to move back in. “It’s so lonely in the house,” she’d said. Her son had left for college. It was a big house: four bedrooms, four bathrooms. She’d paid for it in cash when her grandmother died. He didn’t have any legal claim to it, her attorney had said. She’d slept upstairs in the guest room. But they’d gotten along. They’d gone to zoos and museums and restaurants. Some nights she’d drunk alone in the basement after he’d gone to bed, but that hadn’t bothered him. “Oh, look,” his wife said. “There’s one of the triplets.” She was looking out the side window. The glass was still in her hand. A young deer was in the yard between the house and the neighbor’s. She’d sent him pictures of the triplets when he was out in Portland. He’d sent pictures back from baseball games, him and his college buddies. They’d still gotten along like that, he and his wife. “I can see another one out front,” he said, standing at another window. They stood, each at their own window, watching the deer. The green metal fence was bent in the back where one of the triplets hadn’t cleared it. She’d shown him this earlier. Originally, they had planned to meet the night before to watch the game. There was a small bar near the house where townies went to drink and watch sporting events. She’d started texting him in the afternoon about her headache. She had migraines once or twice a month. Later, she’d called to yell at him for having been away all summer. Then he’d known for sure they weren’t going to watch the game. “I guess I was unexpectedly pissed at you last night,” she’d told him earlier at Denny’s. She’d been shaking and anxious when she arrived. “I’m so nervous,” she’d said, holding out her hand to show him. “Aren’t you?” “No,” he’d said. “Not really.” “You never feel anything,” she’d said. She was smiling but accusing him of something, he wasn’t sure what. “You never once wrote me a letter or email or even a text asking me to reconsider,” she’d said. “I guess I didn’t want to appear weak,” he’d said. She’d stopped drinking her water, set down her glass. “Are you kidding me?” she’d said. “Are you straight out of a movie right now? You didn’t want to appear ‘weak’? What are you, John Wayne? Except you’re not John Wayne at all. You’re nowhere near John Wayne. You’re the complete opposite of John Wayne. So why are you trying to act like it now?” The waitress had returned to take their order, so he’d never had to answer her questions about John Wayne. After that they’d moved on to other things: her son starting grad school and searching for an apartment and so forth. And then a younger man who seemed a little autistic had stopped by their booth on his way to pay his check. “Okay, let’s see,” the young man had said, looking down at Josh’s wife’s plate. It seemed he had only stopped to talk to his wife. “I would eat the eggs, but not that green stuff, which I’m assuming is spinach, and is that turkey bacon? Okay, I wouldn’t eat the turkey bacon. I’d eat that...” The man was pointing. “The English muffin?” his wife had asked. “And the fruit,” the man had said. Then he’d looked down and seen her notebook and pen on the seat next to her. “Are you studying for classes?” he’d said. “Yes, something like that,” his wife had said. “I knew it,” the young man had said. “Well, goodbye.” “Goodbye,” his wife had said, smiling. “He must have thought I was a college student,” she’d said to Josh after the man had left. “That’s the second person this week who thought I was a college student. It’s been thirty years since I was in college,” she’d said, and shrugged her shoulders. She wasn’t shaking or anxious-seeming anymore. Then she’d opened the notebook and begun reciting all the things that needed to be fixed in the house. There was a lot of drywall that needed patching. He’d forgotten how many holes there were in the drywall. The drywall would definitely have to be patched before they sold the house, his wife had said. They were still standing at the windows, watching the deer, but his wife was going on about Richard Burton. First John Wayne and now Richard Burton, he thought. What was it with his wife and old Hollywood actors? It felt to him as though John Wayne and Richard Burton were responsible for the divorce, even though he knew this wasn’t the case. There was a time she used to talk a lot about Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio, about how they were getting back together when Marilyn died, about how Joe had tried to save her. But she hadn’t mentioned them in a while, a few months, maybe a year. “I just finished Richard Burton’s diaries,” his wife was saying. “Remember? I started them last winter? Well, I finally just finished them. The whole second half was pretty much about his and Liz’s alcoholism, how much they drank or didn’t drink each day. He’d use black ink if it was a drinking day and red if it wasn’t, and toward the end there would be a bunch of entries in a row that just said the same thing, one word in black ink: Booze. It was really sad. One time he wrote about Liz being ‘on the wagon’ and said she’d only had—in one week, mind you—one glass of wine, one martini, and ten beers. But then Liz read the diary entry and corrected him. It was actually two martinis, she said. But Richard thought that was pretty irrelevant because in a normal week she drank half a bottle of booze a day. On bad days, he drank a full bottle. Maybe two. I can’t remember now. I think two. Anyway, the whole second half of the diary is Richard fighting this battle with alcoholism and ultimately, of course, losing. But he was so intelligent and witty and intellectual and well-read; no matter how much he was drinking he always seemed to manage to read about ten or fifteen books a week. He was really well-read. He really wanted to be a writer, you know. He was really passionate and sexy.” “Sexy?” he said. He hadn’t thought his wife would find a man like Richard Burton sexy. He wondered if she found John Wayne attractive, but he didn’t feel like asking. He didn’t wonder that much. “Yeah. I don’t think you can find a man with all those qualities anymore. He was also a little dangerous too; reckless, on account of the boozing. But tender too. I really miss him. I guess I got sort of obsessed with him. The worst part is I thought I still had a lot more of the diaries left when it ended, abruptly, because I was reading it on my Kindle and it said I was only at about seventy percent, but I guess there were a lot of indexes and bibliographies and stuff like that. So when it all of a sudden said Richard had died, I was in shock. Just like how you would be in real life when a friend dies, I guess. So maybe it was appropriate I didn’t know it was ending. That it came as a shock as it did.” “Hmm, maybe,” he said. “After that, I started reading all these novels and short stories about alcoholics who only drink wine or champagne to try to taper off drinking. Like Liz. That’s when I knew I was probably an alcoholic, too,” she said. He nodded. She’d already told him she’d been drinking champagne and wine all summer. She’d thrown out the whiskey and the vodka and the gin and the tequila. He didn’t mention the bike and bar crawl in Portland, vomiting on Bret’s lawn. “Anyway, my mom went to see her aunt, my great-aunt May, this summer. She’s ninety-six, and she told my mom she prays every night before she falls asleep that she won’t wake up in the morning, that she’ll just die, but she always does—wake up, I mean. So after that, Mom and I joked we would drink and smoke more. Not that Mom needs encouraging,” she said. “Right,” he said, agreeing. “Your mom is probably good to go without your aunt’s confession.” “But I did sort of think about it, like, the ten years or so they say smoking takes off, what if those are the eighty-six to ninety-six years for me? I’d be fine with that. Both my mom’s dad and my mom’s mom died in their late eighties, and drank a lot, and that seems good. I’m fine with dying in my eighties.” “Yeah,” he agreed. “Eighties are good.” “Much more than that and you can’t walk or see or hear anyway,” she said. “Might as well drink then,” he said. She laughed. “Right?” she said. “Might as well. Except I think Richard Burton was in his late fifties, and my mom’s third husband was in his late fifties, and her fourth husband, too, come to think of it. And they all probably died from alcohol-related causes. So, I don’t know.” “You just never know,” he said. He was in the fridge now. He had the door open and was looking inside. “What are you looking for?” she said. “I was just looking to see if you had any other beer, beer with lower alcohol content, but that’s dumb, because I know you don’t. You got rid of any beer that was here earlier in the summer,” he said. “I’ll just have this, it’s fine.” “Oh, I didn’t realize the beer we got was high alcohol content,” she said. “Yeah,” he said. “Eleven percent.” “Oh, no wonder I feel a little woozy,” she said, moving her head around, side to side. He laughed. “You’ve only had about an eighth of one beer,” he said. “You know I only really drink alone. Another sign of an alcoholic,” she said. “Right,” he said. “I do know that.” It had never bothered him, though. Back at his new apartment, he unrolled the sleeping bag and sat down with a bottle of whiskey handy. His wife had said she planned out the nights she drank. It didn’t make any difference to him. Tomorrow Luke would come and they would pick up the mattress from the house. Tomorrow night he’d have a mattress to sleep on, and the day after that, the bed frame his wife had picked out for him at the furniture store. Before he’d left the house, she’d said, “Well, aren’t you going to hug me?” He’d looked at her awhile. He was still trying to figure things out.

        "story": "Too early for spring, you couldn’t trust such blinding-white sunshine in mid-March. And the smell of damp earth thawing, reviving—too soon. Abigail was feeling light-headed. Unreal. A seismic sensation, as if the very earth were shifting beneath the wheels of her car, on the familiar drive home. Staring ahead, dismayed—blocking the road was a barrier with a jarring yellow sign: detour. “Damn.” Rarely elsewhere than in her car did Abigail address herself, and usually in an exclamatory/exasperated tone. If anyone had overheard she’d have been mortified. “God damn.” Three quarters of the way home and now she’d be forced miles out of her way. For these were country roads that intersected infrequently, unlike urban streets laid in a sensible grid. She would get home later than she’d planned and have less time to herself before her husband returned from work. That dreamy interlude, preparing a meal with care, for just herself and her husband. A fireside dinner, with candles. And she had good news to share with Allan, which she would keep for just the right moment. Darling, guess what! The lab report? Negative! Not totally unexpected news. Not after months of treatment. But exhilarating nonetheless—for in a year of medical news not invariably good, even mildly good news was welcome. One by one, with robotic precision, the vehicles ahead of Abigail turned left onto a smaller road. She wondered at their docility—she was tempted to drive around the damned barricade. Her house was less than a mile away. Should she take a chance? No impediments or construction were visible in the road. You had to resent the non-negotiable nature of detour: ask no questions—no one to ask—simply follow the signs, trusting that they will lead you to your destination. Was ignoring a detour illegal? Was it dangerous? What a strange thing for Mom to do! Getting a traffic ticket, a summons, the first in her lifetime... She was not an impulsive person. For thirty years she’d lived in the same house in the suburbs five miles west of Stone Ridge, New Jersey, with her husband and, while they’d been young, their several children; thirty years, the unvarying route on North Ridge Road. In all those years she’d driven into the surrounding countryside only rarely and had little knowledge of the network of back roads. She could not recall ever encountering a detour or, if she had, how inconvenient the detour had been. She’d hoped to have more time to herself in the house, in the kitchen, which was her favorite room, before her husband returned from work. Though possibly Allan was already home, for he’d become semiretired the previous year. His schedule now varied from week to week, as he was needed at the firm. Her husband’s custom was to recount his day to her in detail: what he’d done at the office, how much (or how little) he’d accomplished, with whom he’d had meetings, or met for lunch, or spoken on the phone. There were ongoing narratives—names that had become familiar to her over the years, though she’d met only a few of her husband’s colleagues; rivalries, alliances, sudden rifts, feuds, tragic developments, startling consequences. In these accounts, Allan was invariably the protagonist: the center of the narrative. Though Abigail did not always listen closely to his reports, she took comfort in hearing them. Impossible not to feel a wave of tenderness for the man who, through the years, from the very start of their marriage, solemnly recited to his wife the banalities of his life, as a child might recite the events of his life to his mother, secure in the knowledge that anything he did, anything he said, because it was his, would be prized by her if not by anyone else. In exchange, Abigail told her husband of her day, more briefly. For she was the wife, and she had a dread of boring him. As a young woman, indeed as a girl, Abigail had learned to shape herself to fit the expectations of others. If there was a singular narrative of her life it had the contours of a supple, sinuous snake, ever delighting in its contortions and in the shimmering, iridescent camouflage-skin that contained it. Even as a mother! Perhaps as a mother most of all. Crucial not to let them know. How frightened you are, how little you understand. How astonished you are that they have survived. For nothing is so flimsy seeming as a human infant. Soft-skulled, soft-eyed, with such tiny lungs, you fear it might collapse with wailing. “Damn!”—her car was bumping, jolting. A fierce winter had left the narrow country road in poor condition, potholed and rutted. Following a line of other vehicles, Abigail was forced to drive unnaturally slowly, gripping the steering wheel with both hands. A throbbing pain had begun at her temples, the sensation of unreality deepened. Surely, the detour would double back soon? You had to surmise that a detour describes a half-rectangle around an impassable road, the object of which is to lead back to that road, on the other side of the blockage. But Cold Soil Road seemed to be leading in the opposite direction from North Ridge. She should call Allan, to tell him that she’d probably be late, but her phone was in her handbag, out of reach in the back seat where she’d carelessly tossed it. In late afternoon the sun was unnaturally bright. The sky resembled a watercolor wash of pale oranges, reds—too “pretty” to be real—and of a particularly banal prettiness, like calendar art. Deciduous trees that only the previous week had been skeletal and leafless were now luminous with tight little greeny buds. Too soon!—Abigail felt a frisson of alarm, dread. From Cold Soil Road her car was shunted onto a narrower country road that seemed to have no name, or at least not one she could discover. No choice but to follow the detour signs, with resentment and mounting unease, though a left turn should have been followed by a right turn, to begin to complete the (rectangular) figure of the detour, and not this slow curve leftward into the countryside. Traffic was sparse on this unnamed road, all in the other direction, strung out along the detour like dispirited bedouins. Worse, after so much jolting, the steering wheel of Abigail’s car seemed to be loosening; each time she turned it the car responded less immediately, as if she were driving on ice. At last, at a curve, she turned the wheel with no effect at all—the car continued forward, off the road and in the direction of a shallow ditch. Panicked, she pumped the brakes, but this too had little effect. Something struck her forehead, as if in rebuke. She heard a murmur of startled voices at a distance, witnesses to her folly. She cried in protest: No! It was not her fault, something had happened to the steering wheel. The front wheels of her car were in the ditch, the rear of the car remained on the roadway. The windshield had seemed to fly back toward her, striking her forehead. She was sobbing with frustration, dismay. What had happened to the steering wheel? And the brakes—useless. Much effort was required for Abigail to extricate herself from the tilting car. Pushing the driver’s door open, climbing out into the road, panting. Her heartbeat was erratic, like her breath. She’d been so taken by surprise! Her balance had been affected, she walked as if on the listing deck of a boat. A vehicle approached, she waved frantically for it to stop but the driver seemed not to see her, continuing past without slackening his speed. The vehicle’s windshield shone with reflected sunshine, she could not see the driver’s face. Calling after in a pleading voice, “No, wait! Please don’t leave me...” Her handbag had been left in the back seat, and she could not bring herself to climb into the car. Fortunately the ditch was fairly shallow, the front wheels were submerged in less than a foot of water but the water smelled brackish, foul; she did not want to wade into it, still less did she want to grope around where water had begun to seep inside, with a hoarse gurgling sound as of occluded breath. Peering through the side windows she couldn’t see her handbag; she guessed that it had been flung onto the floor. No, she couldn’t retrieve it, not her cell phone, not her wallet. The key was still in the ignition, she couldn’t bring herself to retrieve that, either. In the interim, another vehicle had passed, driving imperturbably on despite the sight of Abigail and her car partway in the ditch. She climbed back onto the roadway, trying to hold herself erect, unswaying. She understood: it was crucial not to give an impression of drunkenness, or injury. (Was her face bleeding? A stranger would not wish to bloody the interior of his car.) Her fingers gingerly touched her throbbing forehead and came away unbloodied, but her nostrils felt loose and runny—was her nose bleeding? She dared not touch it for fear of injuring herself further. But what had happened to her left shoe? She was standing in just one shoe; on her left foot was a light woolen sock, soaked from the ditch. Miserably she looked around on the roadway to see whether the shoe was there—but no, of course it was inside the car, no doubt on the floor in the front, which had begun to fill with water. No choice but to make her way, limping, half-sobbing, along the road, in the direction of a nearby house; she would ask to use the telephone. This was not an unreasonable request though she was looking disheveled, and her damned nose was leaking blood. Now! You must prove yourself. A curious sort of anticipation overcame her. Almost euphoria. Most of her life she’d been waiting—for what, she hadn’t known. As a bright and curious girl-child, waiting for her true life to begin. As a restless but shy adolescent, waiting for her true life to begin. Before she’d met the man she would marry, waiting for her true life to begin. And then, in the months before she’d married this man, waiting for her true life to begin. Before she’d had her first pregnancy, and her first baby—waiting for her true life to begin. And now that the children had grown and gone away—waiting for her true life to begin. Something meant for me alone. Just—for me.  That has been waiting for me to arrive. Because I have not been in the right place until now. But now—am I in the right place? It was comforting to see that the house she approached wasn’t a derelict farmhouse like others in the area but one that resembled her own: a dignified colonial of wood, brick, and fieldstone; not new, in fact probably at least a hundred years old, but beautifully restored and renovated: roof, shutters, and windows replaced and the clapboards freshly painted creamy white, which suggested that the property owners were affluent like Abigail and her husband, who lived, Abigail calculated, about three miles away—if you took not the circuitous detour but a straight path. Gravel horseshoe driveway, spacious front lawn with evergreen shrubs; several acres bordered by tall oaks; at the rear, a barn converted into a three-car garage. Abigail’s heart lifted! Whoever lived in this house would not be suspicious of her but would recognize her as a neighbor. Possibly they knew her, and, yet more possibly, knew her husband. Possibly they had been guests in the R__s’ house, and would be grateful to return their hospitality. Before ringing the bell Abigail dabbed at her face with a tissue, which came away stained with blood; she used another tissue to wipe her damp eyes, and to blow her nose, cautiously. (Yes, it was bleeding.) With a stab of guilt she recalled having heard the front doorbell in her house ring not long ago, and having stood very still waiting for the ringing to cease and whoever it was to go away from the door; for none of her or Allan’s acquaintances would have rung the doorbell without first notifying her that they were coming, and no one who rang the doorbell without first notifying her was anyone she’d have wished to see. A second time she pressed the bell, politely. She would not press insistently, for such an act would signal aggression, a kind of threat. Nor would she knock loudly on the door, and frighten or antagonize whoever might be inside, listening somewhere in the interior of the house. Rehearsing what she might say, with an apologetic smile—Excuse me! I am so, so sorry to bother you but I was following the detour and I’ve had a little accident, my car is in a ditch! If I could use your phone to call my husband... She might have said call Triple A, or call a garage, but she preferred call my husband as this phrase indicated not only the likelihood of a nearby household but the stability of a lengthy marriage. And she would give her address, to establish her identity as a fellow property owner, with all that this entailed in Bergen County, one of the most affluent in the state. For a confused moment not remembering: Was it Ridge Road? North Ridge? Ringing the doorbell again, listening for a response. None. Her forehead throbbed, her nose was leaking blood. If only she’d brought her damned phone! Despite the prematurely balmy air she was shivering. The sole of her left foot ached, she’d stepped on sharp stones. Then recalling: there was surely a side entrance to the staid old colonial, a door that led into a small vestibule, and then into the kitchen. Limping, favoring her shoeless foot, she followed a flagstone path around the side of the house, and there indeed was another entrance. And here too was a doorbell, which she pressed with more confidence—in her own home she understood that whoever pressed the buzzer beside the kitchen door was likely to be familiar with her household: the delivery man, or the gas-meter man, or a friend; those who rang the front door were likely strangers, about whom a homeowner would naturally feel wary. Are you hiding in there? Please—if you are hiding—I only need to make a phone call, you are under no obligation to help me further... I am not injured. I am not bleeding! I promise. I am your neighbor. But no one came to answer this door, either. Abigail shaded her eyes to peer through the window: there was the vestibule with coats, jackets, and sweaters on hooks, boots on the floor, exactly as in her house, and a doorway opening into a kitchen. Bars of sunshine fell slantwise on a tile floor not unlike her own, a deep russet brown. And, on an overhead rack, copper utensils hung shining. “Hello? Hello? I—I’m in need of—help...” It seemed to her that she was being observed. A surveillance camera eye, somewhere overhead. On the doorframe, a discreet notice like the one beside the kitchen door of her house: These premises protected by Achilles Home Security, Inc.  Then she realized: whoever lived here surely kept a spare key outside somewhere, beneath the welcome mat, or beneath a flower pot or urn, as she did. The key to this house wasn’t beneath the welcome mat, Abigail discovered, which was reasonable: keeping a key in such an obvious place was inviting a break-in, as her husband had warned. Better beneath a flower pot, an urn, or a wrought iron chair or table in a nearby courtyard, a little distance from the door and not as likely to be discovered by an intruder, though in this case Abigail was thrilled to discover the key within minutes, beneath an ornamental urn just a few feet away. Managing then to unlock the kitchen door, and stepping inside, into a warm, yeasty-smelling interior, which felt welcoming to her; she had no fear that an alarm would ring, as indeed no alarm rang. Though certainly she was ill at ease, and would stay in the house only long enough to make a telephone call; she would then return to her incapacitated car and wait for help, and would not inconvenience anyone if she could avoid it. “Excuse me? Hello? Is anyone here? I—I only just need to make a phone call...” Her voice trailed off, uncertainly. She stood very still, listening. (Was the floor creaking overhead? Was someone upstairs, also very still, listening?) After a moment she decided no, only just a distant sound of wind in trees, an airplane passing overhead. Her mouth had gone dry with anticipation. Her heartbeat, triggered by the accident with the car, continued rapidly, with a kind of exhilaration. So long waiting—for what? But where was the telephone? Abigail expected to see a wall phone in the kitchen, in the approximate place where it hung in her own, but this kitchen did not precisely resemble hers. The counters were olive, while her counters were, less practically, white; the deep aluminum sink was in a different location, and so were the Sub-Zero refrigerator and the ovens set in the wall (as in her kitchen, there were two ovens, one on top of the other). Close up, the tile floor did not so closely resemble the tile floor in her house but was of a darker hue. Looking so intently for a telephone had caused the light-headedness to return, as well as a curious fatigue mixed with anxiety, as if, even as Abigail understood (of course!) that she was trespassing in a private household, and had no right to be here, and was behaving very strangely for a person who valued privacy as she did, nonetheless she felt a strong impulse to lie down somewhere, in some quiet place where she would trouble no one, and no one would trouble her; and when she was rested, and thinking clearly again, she would complete the task for which she’d entered the house of strangers... Though for the moment the very concepts phone, call, husband had passed out of her consciousness. She knew her name, though: Abigail R__. And the address of the house in which she’d lived for thirty years—she was sure she could recall it, if required. However, as long as she was in this (unfamiliar) house, and no one seemed to be home, and she was certainly disturbing no one, she reasoned that she might as well use the bathroom, as she’d been needing to do since the accident. She winced at the loud sound of the toilet flushing, and the groan of old pipes, an echo of the pipes in her own house, which needed replacing. She took her time washing her face with cool water, dabbing at her bruised forehead and blood-stippled nose with wet tissues. A strong smell of lavender soap lifted to her nostrils, a scent that brought comfort. The children in this household, too, had grown and gone away, she thought. For you could not have luxury soap in a downstairs bathroom if there were children in the house, you could have only utilitarian soap, and even this they’d leave filmy with the grime of their hands. Impossible, too, to have such delicate linen guest towels. And so there was something sad, bittersweet in the soap scent. Wincing, too, to see her face close-up in the bathroom mirror—often she was mystified that she looked so unlike herself, instead resembling one of her older female relatives; though in the eyes of the world, she supposed, she was—still—an attractive woman, well-groomed, poised, cultured. Her skin was still relatively unlined, her hair thick and glossy. She had not the courage, for instance, to dress other than expensively, as she would never have dared appear in public without judicious makeup; her daughters, who’d scorned makeup when they were young, would have been appalled to see their mother without it even in the privacy of her home. She wiped her hands on a linen hand towel as discreetly as she could and returned the towel to its proper place as neatly as she’d found it. Thank you! I am so grateful. I will not stay long, I promise. Continuing now through the downstairs of the house looking for—exactly what, she couldn’t recall. But she would recognize it when she saw it. A small item. A small item placed on a table... Unsteady on her feet, and indeed the floorboards of the house were uneven, a characteristic of older houses, like basements—“cellars”—with oppressively low ceilings that could never be raised. Giddiness increased, unless it was faintness. The sensation of unreality grew like waves lapping about her legs. She was hesitant to lean forward and lower her forehead to her knees to increase the blood flow into her brain, for she feared the action might make things worse, and she would fall in a dead faint and be discovered by strangers and reported to the authorities. Had to lean against walls. Against the backs of chairs. She seemed to know the way—somewhere. Feeling the need to go upstairs, surrender her pride and crawl on hands and knees up the (carpeted) staircase, out of breath and wincing in pain. At the top of the stairs, resting for several minutes before heaving herself to her feet. Almost there, she consoled herself. Wherever it was, she needed to go. She’d have to conserve her strength, dared not squander it heedlessly; once she’d slept for an hour she was certain to feel much better, and to know what to do next. Someone she’d meant to contact—a husband? Her husband? His name had fallen away, his face was a blur. His name—well, she would know his name, to which her own name was attached... With the instinct of a blind creature she staggered into a room containing a bed. At the top of the stairs, first right. It was a large room—it was a large bed. Her trembling hands managed to pull back a satin comforter so that she could fall into the bed with a shuddering sigh—every bone in her body dissolving, disappearing into the most exquisite sleep; and when she opened her eyes she found herself staring at a ceiling less than eight feet above her head, unless it was a low-hanging cumulus cloud. She smiled at the sight! Her brain was well rested, a kind of balm had washed over it. The bed was so large she felt dwarfed within it. The sheets were of exceptionally good quality but dampened by her sweaty sleep for which she felt chagrin; she reasoned that if she had time she would change the sheets, and no one would be the wiser. She lifted herself onto her elbows, staring. Where was she? This was not a bedroom familiar to her yet it felt familiar—spacious, with pale rose (silk?) wallpaper, and attractive furnishings that looked like family heirlooms. One of them was a massive mahogany bureau atop which a row of framed photographs had been placed with loving attention. For you are securely in the world only if there are such photographs of loved ones to testify to your existence, and your worth. From the bed, however, Abigail could not make out the faces in the photographs. Some were very likely older relatives, others were children. But all were hazy with light reflected from the windows, unnaturally bright for a late afternoon in March. Here was a rude surprise: Abigail’s clothes had been removed from her body! Strangely, she appeared to be wearing a nightgown. Neither familiar to her nor unfamiliar: a nightgown of soft flannel in a pink floral pattern, which fitted her naked body loosely. She blushed hotly to think that someone had dared to undress her while she’d been asleep, and had put a nightgown on her, as one might prepare a child for bed, or a hospital patient; she’d given no consent for anyone to touch her, still less to remove her clothing. That she’d been undressed—and dressed—without having awakened suggested that she’d been sleeping very deeply, perhaps for a longer period of time than she’d imagined. “Hello? Is someone here?” Her voice seemed to reverberate in the air close about her. On her feet, shakily. Bare feet on a carpeted floor. Even the light woolen socks had been removed by whoever had dared to undress her. While she’d slept her heartbeat had slowed. Now it was rapid again, painful. All her senses were alert. She must escape! Must find her clothes, dress, and slip from the house. Whoever had dared touch her might return at any moment. Shuddering to think it might have been a he. A stranger, daring to strip her naked as she lay oblivious in sleep profound as death. She searched for her clothing in the room and could not find it, though her single shoe lay on the carpet beside the bed as if it had been tossed down. She thought—But just one damned shoe is useless!  In fact, this was not true. Had she not climbed out of her car and walked along the roadway and entered this house wearing but the single shoe? She could do it again if necessary. Another surprise: when she tried the bedroom door, the doorknob was loose in her fingers. Though the doorknob turned and turned, it did not open the door. She pulled at the doorknob. Panicked she called out, “Hello? Hello?” Rapping on the door with her fist. “Hello? Is somebody there? I—I’m in here... I’m upstairs, I’m here.” She pressed her ear against the door. Beyond the rapid beating of blood in her ears she could hear—something... Voices? Footsteps? A door opening, closing? The ordinary sounds of a household, at a little distance. Desperately she struck her fists against the door. Calling out, crying—Hello hello hello! Let me out!—until her throat ached, her voice was cracked and hoarse. Was she being kept captive? Of course, it was likely a mistake of some kind. A misunderstanding. She, Abigail R__, closely resembled another woman, perhaps. This other woman was the one intended to be captive. Standing near the mahogany bureau, still she couldn’t make out the faces in the photographs. No matter how she squinted, the faces inside the frames—adults, children—remained out of focus, hazy with light. And the view from the second-floor windows: tall trees, mostly leafless, a landscape that was still sere and bleached from winter, though beginning now to revive; since trees surrounded the house there was no visible horizon, all was foreshortened. Yet, when she looked more closely, she saw that the scene was flat and unconvincing, like a stage set; trees, grass, sky, an overly bright sun all at the same approximate distance from her, lacking depth. The wave of dizziness intensified. Was she flat as well, in this landscape? When had “perspective” come into human consciousness?—she tried to recall. Medieval art was strangely flat, there was no illusion of depth. Human faces lacked expressions, as if the artists of the time did not see the plasticity of the normal face. Children did not resemble children, but rather stunted adults. She pressed her flushed face against the windowpane, trying to see at a slant—a corner of the barn, which had been converted into a garage; a glimpse of the country road where her car was stranded a quarter-mile away, front wheels in a ditch. Oh, why had she abandoned her car so quickly! She should have tried to free it from the ditch. If she’d rocked the car forward and back, forward and back, gaining momentum by degrees, as a more confident and skilled driver might have done, she might be home by now. Instead, she’d given up at once, defeated. Instead, she was trapped in a stranger’s house. Only a few miles from her own house, captive. Her bladder ached sharply, as a child’s bladder might, in animal panic. A bathroom adjoined the bedroom, Abigail went to use it, hurriedly. Here was a spacious, white-tiled bathroom that was clearly in frequent use. Thick towels hung on racks, slightly askew. There were two sinks, neither entirely clean. A mirror just perceptibly spotted. Electric toothbrushes (two), a twisted tube of toothpaste, hand lotion, a hand mirror, a hairbrush, combs (two), cuticle scissors, tweezers... At least two people used this bathroom. Abigail lifted the hand mirror and saw, yes—it was a silver mirror, heavy in the hand, ornately engraved but in need of polish. Mirrors ran the length of the bathroom, in panels. In each mirror a wraithlike figure in a shapeless gown stared at Abigail aghast. Then she saw the bathroom had a second door, which might lead into another bedroom, or a hallway; but when she seized the knob to turn it, she discovered that it was locked. She could have sobbed. The doorknob turned but to no avail. Stumbling back into the bedroom, Abigail saw to her astonishment that a stranger had entered the room in her absence. At first she could not see his face clearly—it was blurred, like a smudged thumb. He must have unlocked the door—the door with the broken doorknob—for there appeared to be no other way into the room. And what was he carrying? A heavy cut-glass vase of dazzling white flowers that exuded a pungent fragrance—gardenias. “Why, darling! What are you doing out of bed?” He was startled, alarmed. Genuine concern, an undercurrent of dismay and exasperation. “And your feet—bare.” Abigail was sure she’d never seen this man before. He had thick, white, gnarled-looking hair, a low forehead and a broad, flushed face; he wore a dark pinstripe suit that fit his stocky figure somewhat tightly, a white shirt and a necktie, polished dress shoes. He set the vase onto a bedside table: he’d brought the bouquet of white flowers for Abigail. How powerful, the sickly sweet smell of gardenias! Abigail felt dizzy, dazed as if ether had been released in the airless room. Stunned speechless as the stranger addressed her worriedly: “Please go back to bed, darling. Do you want to catch pneumonia again? Next time might be fatal. And what if you’d fallen, when no one was here!” “But I—I—I don’t belong here...” “Bare feet! For God’s sake.” He would have led Abigail forcibly back to the bed but Abigail shrank from him, rebuffing his hands, preparing to scream if he touched her—but he did not touch her; instead, unexpectedly, he shrugged and turned aside, as if Abigail’s behavior had offended him. “Ah, well. It’s just good that I’ve come home. I never know what—what in bloody hell—I will discover.” He laughed, harshly. Clearly he was disgusted. But he was also dismayed. Yanking off his necktie, and hanging it in a closet on a rack of other ties; Abigail could see that these were expensive designer ties. His back to her, oblivious of her, matter-of-factly he removed his suit coat, and hung it carefully in the closet; removed his white dress shirt, his trousers, and his shoes, to change into more comfortable attire—red plaid woolen shirt, khaki trousers, moccasins. A heavy sigh. “Jesus Christ. I never know.” Abigail stood staring, astonished. This stranger was changing his clothes right before her eyes, with the casual disdain of a husband. Almost, she was moved to apologize, for clearly there was a profound misunderstanding between them. To Abigail’s greater astonishment the white-haired man proceeded to recite to Abigail, in grim detail, his day: an early-morning conference call with clients in Tampa and Dallas; a lunch meeting at the club with ___, ___, and ___; much of the afternoon spent at his desk, going over accounts with ___; then, on the phone with ___; then, another conference call, with clients in San Diego and Houston. Abigail interrupted: “Excuse me!—but I want to go home...” The white-haired man ceased speaking. A coarse red blush deepened at the nape of his neck. All this while he’d been standing with his back to Abigail, stiff and unyielding, refusing to face her. Abigail sensed that he was very angry; he had not liked being interrupted during his report, which had seemed to him important, and should have impressed his listener. “I—I said—I want to go home.... You’ve locked me in here, I don’t belong here, I want to go home.” Abigail was shivering violently. The sensation of faintness deepened. She said, stammering: “You—you have no right to keep me here! It’s against the law to keep me against my will! I never consented. I don’t know you. I had an accident on the road but I’m not injured—I don’t need any medical care—I’ve been able to rest and I’m ready now to leave—I want to go home.” “Darling, you are home. Please just get into bed.” Gently, grimly the man reasoned with Abigail. He was several inches taller than Abigail and at least thirty pounds heavier, his breathing audible. He might have been appealing to a neutral observer—he was being the most reasonable of men. Abigail protested: “I—I am not home. I don’t know who you are. This is wrong—this is not my home...” “Of course this is your home! You’re just very tired, dear. It’s time for your medication.” “No! No medication!” Abigail’s voice rose in alarm. The white-haired man dared not press the issue. “It’s a mistake. I don’t belong here. There was a detour. At North Ridge Road...” Buoyantly these words came to Abigail, precious as a life jacket to one drowning in treacherous waters—North Ridge Road.  Other words she’d lost, could not retrieve, somehow these crucial words had returned to her, which she was sure would impress her captor. “Detour? I didn’t notice any detour, darling. You haven’t been out, what would you know of detours and road conditions? I’ve been out. I’ve never heard of any North Ridge Road—I think you must mean Northanger Road. But that’s nowhere near here, that’s over in Hunterdon County.” The man spoke patiently, and with an air of sorrow. Though white-haired, he wasn’t elderly; probably in his early sixties. You could see how disconsolate he was. How close to despair. How bitterly he blamed her. And how awkward Abigail was, in the flannel nightgown that fell billowing to her ankles and would have tripped her if she’d dared to push past her captor and escape out the door. But no: she seemed to recall that there was no escape through that door, at least for her. No escape!—her captor insisted that she return to bed as if she were ill. As if the fault were somehow hers, that she was in this predicament and he was obliged to be with her, overseeing her. For of course she could not be trusted to be alone. For of course she had proven that, with her behavior. Insisting that of course she was home, this was her home, it was upsetting to him, as it was to their children, when she demanded to be allowed to go home, for she was only just tired, and she was only just confused, and had not taken her afternoon medication; but she should be comforted to know—she was home, this had been her home for thirty-two years. Abigail protested: “But—you are not my husband! This is ridiculous.” “It is ridiculous. Of course I am your husband, and you are my wife.” For a long painful moment they stared at each other. Each was trembling, furious. The thought came to Abigail—You have hurt this man’s feelings terribly. What if you are mistaken? What if he is your husband? The sensation of faintness deepened. Vertigo, in the brain. A mistake, some sort of mistake, but whose fault? Abigail could not comprehend. Just as the house in which she found herself, this very bedroom, was intended to replicate, or to actually be, her bedroom, and her house—yet was not. Abigail recalled that dreams are inaccurate in small, baffling ways. Why?—to understand, one would have to understand the human brain, which is beyond comprehension. A small mistake can be a cataclysmic mistake. Once such a mistake has been made, who can unmake it? Why didn’t they send better actors? Abigail had to laugh. And then: if they’d sent better actors, she would never have realized. A captive, and the “husband” the captor, the keeper of the key, and she, the “wife,” would never have realized. “You are very tired, dear. And, you know, darling—you are not well...” Silently, she demurred. Yes. No. But yes—she was very tired. For the man had the advantage, obviously. He must have a key to the door, for he had dominion over the house. As the roles had been cast, to the male has gone the dominant role; it would be futile for Abigail to protest, so late in her life. If the stranger confronting her would not acknowledge the imposture, if he continued to behave belligerently as if Abigail were indeed his wife of thirty-two years, there was little that Abigail, his captive, could do about it. A weariness had settled over Abigail like a fine mesh net. With the forced affability of a husband who is moved to magnanimity in the face of a sullen and unreasonable wife, the man reverted to the (familiar, comforting) subject of his day at work: conference calls, meetings, a luncheon. He spoke of his plans for the next day, and the next; reciting more names, a litany of names, ___, ___, and ___. For if you are a man among men you are securely in the world only if there are such witnesses to testify to your existence, and your worth. In this way, beating Abigail down as one might beat down a defenseless creature with a broom, not injuring the creature but (merely) beating it down, down, wearing it down; the captive swayed on her (bare) feet, very tired now, faint-headed, weakened as the fine mesh net tightened about her. When had she eaten last, she could not recall. When had she slept last, she could not recall. When had she drawn a deep breath of fresh air, the kind that fills the lungs to capacity and thrills the soul, she could not recall. When had she heard her own name enunciated, what name was hers, she could not clearly recall. Perhaps she was anemic, her blood would require an infusion. Perhaps her brain had begun to dry out, crumble like clay. Perhaps she could no longer chew and swallow solid food, soft-blended food would have to be provided by her captor or captors or she would perish. The exasperating certitude with which the white-haired man spoke made Abigail realize that she’d lost such certitude herself. In the accident perhaps—her forehead slammed against the windshield. That was it: the beginning. Her fingertips touched the swollen bruise, sensitive between her eyebrows as a third eye, yet unopened. She’d misplaced crucial words. She’d left her handbag behind, and the small electronic device with which (she knew! she felt this so strongly) she could have summoned her true husband who would have annihilated this impostor. She’d lost the key to—something. What, she wasn’t sure. In a shadowy region of her brain these crucial words resided but she could not locate the region, and if she did she could not have opened the door, which was locked, or its doorknob sabotaged so that it turned uselessly in the hand. Now she recalled that she’d been seeing signs in recent days, weeks: the faces that mirror your own face, familiar faces that behave in unfamiliar ways; faces whose expressions you must decipher in order to decipher your own condition; those faces that have been smiling, alert, admiring through your lifetime but have now (inexplicably) ceased to smile. When these faces betray alarm, dread, pity, you shrink from being seen by them and you no longer wish to see them. She cried how she hated him!—why didn’t he let her die. Pushed his hands away, screamed at him not to touch her even as he protested: “But I love you! My darling wife, please...” Now he did advance upon her. Clumsy, weeping. As an older man might weep, unpracticed in tears. His arms in the woolen shirt around her, Abigail in the flannel nightgown smelling of her body. She was not without shame—shame would cling to her to the last. Holding her tight. Holding her as a drowning man might hold another person, desperate that she not escape. Abigail could not breathe; this person was squeezing the breath from her. Arms against her sides, bound tight. As together they staggered toward the bed, fell heavily onto the bed. The physical reality of another’s body is always a shock—size, density, heat. His tears wetted her face. She had not the strength to break free. Until at last too exhausted to resist she lay beside her captor, weeping with him, in deference to him, her brain blank, annihilated. Her eyelids were too heavy to keep open and so what bliss, to surrender to sleep; what bliss, the sweet-sickly dazzling-white smell of gardenias that pervaded the room entering her nostrils, flowing up into her brain like ether precipitating the most delicious sleep in the arms of the stranger. His arm over her, heavy, comforting. “My darling wife! I will never abandon you.” Something was pressing on her chest. An opened hand, a sweaty palm. Terror of suffocation. Waking abruptly, to glaring light. Was it another day, a morning, or was it the same day, interminable? Had she endured a night? But sleep had bathed her raw aching brain. She could think more clearly now. Here was the shock: beside her in the rumpled bed lay the man—the man with the gnarled-looking white hair, the stranger intended to be her husband, on his back, open-mouthed, asleep, breathing deeply as a drowning man might suck at air. Stunning to Abigail, to realize that she’d slept beside her captor. Hours of oblivion, shame. In her sleep she had not known. Yet she must have known. Could not have not known. Again it came to her: how large, how solid, how purposeful, how real, a (masculine) body beside a (female) body, horizontal in bed. In the night the man must have pulled off the red plaid shirt—his fatty chest was exposed in a thin, strained undershirt. Beneath the satin comforter his lower body might have been naked. (She could not bear to look.) On the carpet beside the bed lay the man’s shirt, trousers that looked as if they had been flung down. The white hair was disheveled. The face showed strain, fatigue. Coarse hairs sprouted on the jaw. The eyelids quivered. A whistling sound in the nose. Oh, she’d been hearing that whistling in her sleep, it had insinuated itself in her sleep, in her dreams, a bright red thread of mercury, a poison seeping into her brain. Abigail shrank from the man, in revulsion of his damp, perspiring body, and in dread of waking him. A despairing thought came to her, like a reversed prayer—Will I have to kill him, to be free? An unnatural light shone through windows overlooking a flattened landscape, a bright-blue papier-mâché sky. Piercing laser-white of spring sunshine, from which there is no escape. And the sweet, poisonous smell of gardenias—this too clung to bedsheets, pillow, her hair, which was matted and wild about her head as if she’d been a captive not for less than twenty-four hours but for many days. On her (bare, tender) feet!—carefully easing out of the bed. Scarcely daring to breathe for fear that the impostor-husband would awaken suddenly. She must escape her captor. She must act quickly, immediately. She must not allow her captor to take the advantage again. To wake, to overcome her. Rapidly her thoughts careened along a roadway to an unavoidable destination: she would break the vase over the man’s head as he slept, cracking his skull and rendering him helpless; the blow might not kill him, for Abigail had no experience committing so desperate an act, no sense of how much strength might be required to execute it; nor did Abigail want to hurt another person, even an adversary. Even a poorly cast actor meant to be her husband. And if she rendered her captor unconscious and helpless, where would she find the key? In a pocket of his trousers? In a drawer somewhere in the room? She had no idea. Absurd, she could never hurt another person. Not Abigail R__! She had neither the will nor the strength. He was not to be blamed, perhaps. As blameless as she. As confined. But she was trembling with excitement, adrenaline flooded her veins like liquid flame. So long as the man slept she had a chance to escape. So long as he possessed no consciousness of her she was free of him. In a closet she discovered women’s clothing, she snatched at a jacket, at slacks, a soft jersey fabric that would be warm against her bare legs, a pair of shoes sturdy for running. On the bed amid rumpled sheets the white-haired man continued to sleep heavily. His breathing was irregular and hoarse, painful to hear. In his nose, the thin whistling sound that grated against Abigail’s nerves. For some minutes as in a curious trance of lethargy Abigail regarded the impostor-husband with mounting rage. Obviously, he was the one who’d undressed her. Apart from Abigail he was the sole actor in this preposterous and haphazard drama in which she’d been confined. He had gazed upon her naked body, he had dared to touch her, commandeer her. He had dared to lock her in this room, and he had dared to overwhelm her with his superior weight, his very anguish, he’d dared to force her to lie docile in his arms, too weak to resist. All that he’d done, he had done to her.  Waking from her trance as if someone had snapped their fingers to rouse her, Abigail stealthily lifted the heavy cut-glass vase and carried it into the bathroom, removed the flowers, and, as quietly as she could manage, poured out the water; breathing calmly, thinking calmly, silent on bare feet, she returned swiftly to the bed where her captor lay sleeping, and not giving herself time to think she raised the vase high over her head and brought it down hard on the skull of the slumbering man. He was wakened instantaneously, gave a high shrieking cry, thrashing, bleeding profusely, as with fearless hands Abigail again lifted the vase as high as she could and brought it down a second time against his skull... Wanting to cry in triumph—It isn’t my fault! You took me captive! I didn’t choose this. You will survive. Quickly then, Abigail adjusted the white silk comforter to hide the ruined, blood-glistening face. The body had convulsed, and had ceased twitching. She knelt beside the man’s discarded clothing. Searching pockets, frantic to find a key. Hastily she pulled off the blood-stained nightgown. Hastily she dressed. Threw on clothes. No time to spare, shoving her (bare, tender) feet into shoes that fit, or nearly. In the other closet she discovered, in a pocket of the dark pinstriped suit coat, a key chain—keys; to her sobbing relief one of them fit the bedroom door, and allowed her to open it with a single assertive twist of the knob. Now she had only to retrace her steps. Hurriedly down the stairs, through the kitchen and out the rear door, into fresh cold bright air, no one to observe, no one to call after her, now running in the awkward shoes of a stranger, panting, out to the road, and along the road a quarter mile or so to her car that was exactly as she’d left it the previous day—front wheels in a shallow ditch, rear wheels on the road. In a haze of exhilaration, running in bright cold air. After the confinement of the bedroom, after the stultifying embrace of the captor-husband, what joy to draw air deep into her lungs. So relieved to see her car, Abigail laughed aloud. Though it was shamefully mud-splattered. Her husband would be astonished, disapproving. What have you done, Abby! I just had that car washed. A white car, impractical. After a little difficulty, she managed to open the door to the driver’s seat, managed to climb inside. There, the key in the ignition!—just where she’d left it. Would the engine start? Abigail shut her eyes, turned the key. Her luck held. Now, the task of rocking the car forward and back, forward and back, grim, dogged, determined to get the front wheels free, until at last the wheels began to gain traction, borne by momentum. White exhaust billowed up behind. The wheels strained, but took hold. Out of desperation, Abigail succeeded. With a final jolt the car was up on the road. Four wheels, solidly on the road. Abigail could breathe now. Her eyesight was clearer, her lungs clearer now. If only she’d had more faith in herself the day before—she would be home now, and safe. Driving back in the direction of North Ridge Road. At least, she believed that she was driving in the direction of North Ridge Road. Several miles, passing few vehicles. She wasn’t seeing detour signs. Yet, the landscape seemed familiar. And there was North Ridge Road, abruptly. Again, the barricade and the jarring yellow sign: detour. Again, no one in sight. No crew repairing the road, no impediment beyond the barricade that she could see. She calculated that she was less than a mile from her house and so, impulsively, she drove around the barricade, and continued on North Ridge as she should have done the previous day. The sun was still unnaturally bright, luminous. Budding leaves were just perceptibly greener than the previous day. Her heart was suffused with hope, in minutes she would be home.

        "story": "I am a member of the Very Beneficial Changeling Society. Perhaps you have heard of us? We love our name, the Very Beneficial Changeling Society, because it indicates in some way the good that we do. And we do a lot of good, a rather profound and incalculable good. Our founder, the late Elayne Simkin, noticed a rather sad fact, a fact that one would rather not think about, and not only did she notice the fact, but she considered it, took it to heart, and acted. That fact is the following: most people don’t deserve to have children! They aren’t prepared at all—and because they are unprepared, because they don’t know anything about the world, how it works, what humans are, how to behave—anything at all!—they raise their children badly. The result is: children who themselves go on to do exactly the same thing. You know, have more children...! And so the Very Beneficial Changeling Society was born. We do not replace children, as the name might indicate. Or we replace them, but with absences—with the space where children were. Our foundation was initially called the Children’s Aid Society, but that name had been taken. That name had been taken and there were litigations, proceedings that forced us to change our title. We are fond of all who love and help children, and sorry to have made the Children’s Aid Society angry. We heartily apologize, and even at the time, we were in fact ready to change our name, but they were already suing us for everything we had. Luckily we had nothing at all! Take it, we said. We will change our name. And we scuttled away into the shadows like the tail of a rat. At the core of our society are two things: education, and testing. They go in the opposite order, actually, and they are applied to completely separate populations. Maybe not what you expected! You see—we specialize in home invasions. Let’s take you for example, you might be at home with your husband on a Sunday, having a glass of cognac and sitting by the television while your children play idly on the floor. They might be doing anything at all. It doesn’t matter. We enter, enter the house, enter the room. You are surprised. How horrified you are! And your husband even more so. People are in your house and without permission. However little you may know about the world and its workings, you know this: we are not supposed to be in your house! Your husband is taken aback, and maybe it’s worse for him, as he’s the one whose job it is, by societal doctrine, to repel invaders. That we are a mix of skinny-armed semigendered misfits only makes the matter more embarrassing for him. Well—he is due much more embarrassment, just wait! Once we have you restrained, we give your children something nice to eat, but healthy, like pickled beet or candied turnip. You sit in our handsome little manacles on your sofa beside your husband. You watch your children consume delicacies and observe, I am sure you observe, how well we handle your offspring. We are much better with children than you are. We are the Very Beneficial Changeling Society! Events proceed: you are given a test. You must explain what life is, and why you have brought a child into the world. We ask you basic questions of math, philosophy, natural science, et cetera. We are interested in your notions of epistemology and metaphysics, also whether you have street smarts, also do you wash your hands often? Yes, no, yes, no, yes? We listen very carefully. We inject you with a substance that, along with a retinal scan, shows us your consistency of character, whether you, for instance, are prone to rage, or fits of pique. We learn about you, carefully but quickly. We are not interested in your financial resources, your wherewithal in the workplace, your level of cultural esteem. Whatever terms you want to use to make us understand your excellence—those will be enough, but only if they are enough. We have open eyes, and the children of the rich we take just as often as the children of the poor, or I should say, in a similar proportion, for you know, the poor are numberless, the rich few. When we discover that your husband gathers with others in a building once a week to drink the blood of a seminude wound-covered man who may or may not have ever lived, well, we are sorry to say, that’s that! We pack your children into our van and away we go. Incidentally, the substance we injected you with has sterilized you. A good joke! No more children for you! Pray you get reincarnated as a rabbit, or some kind of plenteous fish. That’s the basics of what we call a Visit. When we get your children back to the safe house, there is a lot of talking to be done. We explain some basic matters about society, about biology, human groups. They meet the other children—and that’s really when things start looking up. Your children are so happy to meet the other children. They like each other more than they liked you, much much more, and their intentions vis-à-vis each other are better. They are really interested in what the other children have to say. Meanwhile you could only buy your children’s obedience with toys, sweets, et cetera. What a laugh! From that safe house, we transport your children to one or another compound, and they grow—how quickly they grow!—and soon it is they, it is your children who are visiting others just as you were visited, your children, in essence, who visit you, who take themselves away from you, out of your care. They have seen that you are unfit to be parents, just not good enough as a matter of fact. All of us, we wonder in common why you thought you were wise enough to be parents in the first place—that’s the question we ask you. Just kidding! We know you didn’t really think about it. You just did it. That’s biology! And that’s why the Very Beneficial Changeling Society had to come into being. Too many people having children. Too many of the wrong people—as in, anyone at all! We don’t need more people. In America today, such a broad and palpable ignorance has lain itself across the land. Why, one can speak to dozens of people in a single day and not meet with a single bright face of generosity and kindness. We imagine it must not always have been so. Or was it? Maybe it was always that way. If so—the joke, the so-called human-joke, is even funnier! How does our operation run, you wonder? Are we self-supporting? Do we rely on donations? Well—when we take the children of the wealthy, we sometimes offer a ransom program. We return the children in exchange for a large sum of money, which we use to acquire more children. It works very well, especially well, principally because the children we return, what do they do? They don’t stay with you, with their wealthy parents, do they? No—first chance they get, they run away, and we are waiting with a van, into which they happily climb. Once they are educated about your inferior style of behavior, you may observe they will have nothing more to do with you. The thing is: the society of which you are part is an old-fashioned thing, a rather pitiable and disgusting relic. The Very Beneficial Changeling Society is just one arm of a many-limbed, octopuslike mode of progress. We are a society (writ small) and a SOCIETY (writ large). Among other things we combat: materialism, god delusions, self-delusions, testosterone-drunkenness, human exceptionalism. We have goals, and we move gradually toward them, taking your children as we go. In fact, I might as well be your child, I, the one who is speaking. In a sense we are all one child, all of us who were taken, and you, the insufficient parents, you gather together into a single unit of the incapable. I address you. I say, Here I stand on the carpet of your home staring into your beady eyes, and there on the ground, I, in my younger state, crouch, in expectancy, like some fish that needs to travel surprising paths and distances in its life cycle, from stream to sea to stream. Our wayfinding is impeccable. I address you to say, You are scarcely worth addressing. The sadness really is that you were not yourself visited by the Very Beneficial Changeling Society when you were yourself at an age worth saving. How unlucky! Instead you became one of the pathetic-many, as we term you. You lean into your own morbidity, entertaining yourselves until death with pleasant thoughts of your own remarkable extent. Good luck! Our education process is not interesting because it is completely obvious. We teach: patience, first of all, then resilience and curiosity. We are very practical. The children are to assess their immediate surroundings in order to discover any and all resources. We teach irreverence toward the “law of the land”—whether in America or any other empire. We teach skepticism and an enduring happiness based on constant gratitude. We do not spend too much time on history; so much of it is falsehood-based. But we give a general encapsulation of the previous idiocies of the human race: a series of kings and wars and rapes. And this is how it will continue, just as it has until now, unless we stop it! We believe humans are adults at fourteen, given responsibility and love. Our cadres are made up mostly of young humans between fourteen and thirty, for we only began our work fifteen years ago. I myself am nineteen years old, and have rescued between fifty and one hundred children from various homes. I say between fifty and one hundred because we are cautioned to not take too much credit for what we do. Half of the ones we save could well have chosen, statistically, to escape by running away or suicide. Children do want to escape, you know. They don’t like living with you. I think of the remarkable case of Annabelle and Stephen. They were living with you up until last Thursday, when we visited your house. It was about three in the morning. We woke you up, gathered you out in the garage, tied your hands. You were a bit uppity, weren’t you, Mr. Riley? We had to put the face mask on you, quiet you down. I think you thought, being a corrections officer and all, that you would get your physical way. Of course, we are small and frail, but we are many! Even a large guy like you figured that out pretty quick, and once we got the electric plate attached to your forehead, well, you had to settle down. What is the thing you types like to say—Who’s boss? Yes, Who’s boss. Annabelle, when we got you onto the concrete of the garage, was very awake, very awake for a child of her age, and she immediately recognized us. Why, it’s the Very Beneficial Changeling Society, she told her brother, Stephen. All our prayers have come true. Stephen, aged nine, removed his clothes and asked us for a caftan, the unisex clothing we of the Changeling Society wear, in genderless preference. Of course, we had surplus caftans in the van. We brought him one. How painful it was, Mr. Riley, for you to observe that even while in your care, Stephen dreamed of leaving you. That caftan fit him well, right down to the ground. When we asked you the basic questions, you had few answers. You couldn’t identify the Himalayan Plateau. You didn’t know whether flowering plants preceded animals. You believed in the existence of a soul. Perhaps worst of all, you agreed that money was real! Mostly you wanted to talk about what was going to happen to us. When I get through with you, you said, and other things like that. When I get through with you. That’s what you said. Are you through? Our little cabal stood there, around your hulking fatherness, and I recall Katrin observed very meaningfully, very trenchantly, that with her syringe she had effectively taken your testicles for all of time. How funny that moment was! I remember, it seems like only yesterday, why it was yesterday, Stephen and Annabelle laughing with me about it in the practice yard. Stephen showed me a burn you had given him on one arm, some kind of punishment, and he laughed, such a delicious and brisk laugh. He said, But you took his balls, so it’s all right. Oh, how the leaves flew about our feet, there in the practice yard, in our happiness at your testicle loss. If we are animals, Stephen asked me, what kind are we? I began to say something, but Annabelle put in: hyenas. There it was, she put it in, and I can’t help but think she’s right. We’re not the best, the biggest, we’re not the strongest, the smartest, but we have something else. I don’t know what it is. What is it that hyenas have? That’s what we have, and how fun it makes everything! An article was published in a major metropolitan newspaper that described our methods. The critique it made was very interesting. It proposed that our testing methods were not fair, from a pedagogical standpoint. Immediately we responded with a letter to the editor. Our testing methods are indeed fair. That none of the parents examined, not a single one, has managed to pass the test, well, it just shows how fair the test is. We are certainly not discriminating against anyone. All parents are equally guilty, equally misinformed. The thing is: we’d love to be fair with you, but there just isn’t time. You and your predecessors absolutely ruined the world, and you continue to do so! We won’t have any more of it. You have failed—by your own ethics, by your own morality, and you have certainly failed by ours. How rightfully we blame you. I think of that lovely photograph that is framed on the wall of the inside passage of the very first Children’s Aid Society (before we were forced to change our name). In the photo, Simkin stands with three other young women, the founders of the society! They are in a brick courtyard. They are all wearing gray caftans. Simkin is holding up a police baton—strangely enough, the very tool with which she would herself be beaten to death (by a crowd of officers) at the age of seventeen, less than a year later. She is wearing glasses, thick glasses, for her eyesight was very bad. Her hair is partially braided, and her brow seems furrowed for one so young. Somehow the thick glasses and the police baton, her unkempt style, the posture at once so humble and so aggressive: this is the heart of our endeavor. It declares something like Even as we ruin your pitiable existence, we will not ourselves be constituted as anything much at all. We are too busy. We are looking toward a difficult and actual future, one in which you play no part. We of the Very Beneficial Changeling Society are a bit like the Shakers, but we aren’t delusional and we don’t make furniture. Every child comes with us on its own say-so. Not one has ever been compelled. We sit in the canteen late at night, playing cards, drinking, gambling, laughing. We are all so young and so happy. Look at our faces, so splendid with joy! We laugh together, saying, Will they fear us? Will they fear us? And then we talk about other things. It isn’t even necessary for us to kill you. Like able hyenas, we’ll just take your children and leave you sterile. You’ll find some way to die on your own. But what of the personal, what of my story? I am, like all the rest, far larger than you suspect, far quicker. I remember looking at you, father, and at you, mother, in your sad clothing of incumbency, and thinking, there is a reason for the old expression, children have no friends. Children have no friends. No friends at all. It was at that moment the front door burst open and I was rescued. They came and they rescued me. They rescued me from you.

        "story": "Perhaps she should have known that she would find her lost love—her Viking husband, gone these many years—in Sydesgaard, on the island of Funen, in the village of his people. Asleep in the hut of the medicine woman, comforted by the medicine woman, loved by the medicine woman, who was (it turned out) a podiatrist from Aarhus named Flora. The village itself was an educational site and a vacation spot where, if you wanted, you could wear a costume and spin wool for fun. As for Aksel—was he Joanna’s common-law ex-husband, or ex-common-law husband? Eleven years ago they had broken up after living together for ten. “Broken up”—one summer Aksel left for Denmark, and she never heard from him again. Not never. He sent an apologetic postcard from London. But never after that, nothing for eleven years. She’d married, been made a mother, lost a mother, been legally divorced, finally was fully orphaned by her father’s death. Her father, who had been heartbroken when Aksel disappeared, for his own sake. Who else would breakfast with him on white wine and oysters? Who would discuss the complexities of savory pies: pork, kidney, the empanada versus the Cornish pasty? They had adored each other. Enormous and bearded, condescending and fond, ravenous, sad-eyed, the pair of them. Mortifying, when Joanna thought about it, how alike they were—her friends had commented on it. It was her father who referred to Aksel as a common-law husband, when he was in every way a boyfriend, including the way she thought about him years later: with a lechery untouched by having to legally untangle. After the funeral, her father’s cluttered bedroom was like the tank of an animal who perhaps had died or perhaps had fallen asleep behind the greenery. She looked and looked for him. Nothing felt definitive. The watch was in the nightstand drawer beneath an expired passport, heavy and silver, a steam locomotive on its case, a yellowing sticker on the back: Please bring to Aksel. She read and reread the sticker. Leo, her son, was like his grandfather, drawn to long-ago things, though nine-year-old Leo particularly loved weapons and had nearly every morning for two years drawn in pencil an armory. He liked blades best: swords, bayonets, the occasional flail. He was not allowed toy weapons, though they came into the house the back way. That is, in Lego boxes: bows and arrows the size of safety pins, pistols that snapped into the tense and insatiable hands of Legomen. She turned the watch over in her palm. Perhaps Leo could get interested in horology. She pictured him hunched over a watchmaker’s bench and thought about tossing the note and keeping the watch. Instead, she transferred it from her father’s nightstand into her own. Bring, he’d written. Not mail, not get. The sticker was as close to a will as he’d left, goddamn him. She should probably—she thought, aware of the daft expression already on her face—attempt to honor it. It took a year to settle the estate, sell the condo, come into the little bit of money that would allow them for the first time to travel abroad. Joanna bought Leo the bunk bed that she had wanted as a child. When she went to wake him up for school in the morning, she never knew at what altitude she would find him. That morning he’d hidden himself in the top bunk among the stuffed animals and the alligator-patterned comforter cover, which had disgorged its comforter. Then she saw one bare heel. Even his heel was fast asleep and dear. “Leo,” she said. The heel disappeared. He balled himself up under the covers as though winding himself awake. Then he sat up and blinked, bare-chested and skinny. “What do you think about Vikings?” she asked him. “They’re not my favorite,” he said, and put out his hand. “Glasses?” He was newly bespectacled, having failed a vision test at school. Because he hadn’t cared, she’d picked him out a pair of square black frames, so that he looked not like the bookish skinny wan pubescent boy he was, but like a skinny wan Eighties rocker. Wow, he’d said, stepping out of the optician’s, scanning the parking lot, the parking lot trees, the Starbucks and the Staples. Wow. Just like that, both he and the world looked different. She found his glasses on a bookshelf and handed them up. “Vikings aren’t your favorite?” He scooted to the end of the bunk and climbed down the ladder. “I like Romans.” The underpants he’d slept in were patterned with lobsters, too small. “Vikings didn’t really have horns on their helmets. Did you know that?” “I did not,” she said. For a year and a half, before Leo could read but after he’d begun to talk, Joanna had known everything in his head, thoughts and terrors, facts and passions. He’d belonged to fairyland then; afterward, to books and facts. Now he had thoughts all the time that she hadn’t put in his head, which she knew was the point of having children but destroyed her. “So,” she said. “I have a friend in Denmark. I was thinking we might go there this summer.” Leo sat at his desk and picked up a pencil. In the voice he used for lying, or when he cared too much about something, he said, “If we go, could we go to Legoland?” “I thought that was in California.” “Real Legoland,” Leo explained. “Danish Legoland. Denmark’s where Lego was invented.” “You’re not too old for all that?” The glasses magnified his incredulous look. He was like a midcentury TV journalist who knew he was being lied to. “Mommy, you know I like Lego.” “Yes,” she said. “Of course.” Lego: its salient angles, its minute ambitions. On her own childhood trips, Joanna had been at the mercy of her father’s interests. He drove the car; he decided where to stop it. Not amusement parks, not tourist traps. Instead: war museums, broken-toothed cemeteries, the former houses of minor historical figures, with tables set for dinner—soup tureens and fluted spoons—and swords crossed over the fireplace. Joanna, aged nine, ten, forever, had wanted to go to Clyde Peeling’s Reptiland. To the Mystery Spot, where ball bearings rolled uphill. To Six Flags Over Anywhere. A sign for Legoland would have driven her mad with longing, would have made her whine, even though whining—her mother would point out—had never gotten her anywhere. Her father would have driven on to some lesser Civil War battlefield to inspect an obelisk. Leo was a child of divorce, and all his own vacations were airplane volleys from Rhode Island to California and back. The two of them had never really traveled together. “All right,” she said. “We’ll go to Legoland.” She had already renewed their passports, bought the tickets, reserved a Volvo with a GPS. But you had to give a child the illusion of choice. Legoland was overwhelmingly yellow, and Leo, abashed, hated it. The rides had electric signs that estimated how long you’d have to stand in line to ride them. The log flume was a forty-five-minute wait. The polar roller coaster, an hour and five. It was an ordinary overcrowded amusement park. They had flown through the air, Boston to Paris, Paris to Billund, to end up at this place, the first day of their vacation. He wondered how long they would have to stay for his mother to get her money’s worth. She could be grim about expensive fun. The crowds of children upset him, blonder than the blondest American blond. Flaxen hair, he thought. Like from a book. Flaxen hair and cornflower-blue eyes, though he’d never seen flax or cornflowers in real life. If he had, he might have thought, Blue as a Danish child’s eyes, pale as a Danish child’s mullet. The blondness itself seemed evil to Leo. A blond child who screeches and steps on your foot is compelled by its blondness; a blond mother who hits you with her stroller—here comes another one, rushing after her child, attempting to climb into the lap of the life-size Lego statue of Hans Christian Andersen—does it out of pure towheadedness. In America he would have cried out, but in Legoland he felt he had to bear it. Even the gift shop was disappointing. He’d been imagining something he couldn’t imagine, some immense box that would allow him to build—what. A suit of Lego. A turreted city big enough to live in. Denmark itself. He did not dream in Lego, not anymore, but sometimes he still raked his hand through the bins of it beneath his bed as a kind of rosary, to remind himself that the world, like Lego, was solid and mutable both. Joanna, too, found Legoland terrible; Joanna, too, could not confess. It was a kind of comfort, because Aksel had always been exhausting on the subject of Denmark versus America. Denmark was beautiful, and so were Danes; America was crass, and every moment of American life was a commercial for a slightly different form of American life; you could not so much as enjoy a hamburger without having your next hamburger advertised to you, though the hamburgers would be exactly the same: spongy and flavorless. “Americans have garbage taste,” he would say, tucking into an American banana split. “Not you, Johanna.” He always added a spurious h to her name. “But someday you will go to Denmark, and taste the ice cream, and you will understand.” Clearly the man had never been to Legoland, where even ice cream required a half-hour wait in line, and then was a tragedy of dullness. They stopped at a self-serve slush stand that allowed you to mix any flavors you wanted in a tall plastic vessel that looked like a bong. Leo’s personal cocktail came out Army green. This always happened to his Play-Doh too when it got mixed together. He drank it with his eyes closed and winced. He most resembled his late grandfather when unhappy. “Poor bunny, you’re jet-lagged. Here. Let’s sit.” They sat on the bench next to the Lego Hans Christian Andersen, and Joanna had a sense that they shouldn’t, they should leave the space clear for people who wanted pictures of themselves with a Lego Hans Christian Andersen. But why should those people get their way? “I’m not jet-lagged,” he said. “Do you want to just go to the hotel room?” “Is the hotel room in Legoland?” “Yes,” she said. “Oh.” Then, “I hate it here.” “Denmark?” He looked at her aghast. “This isn’t Denmark,” he said. “Can we go? It’s not what I thought it would be like.” “Yes,” said Joanna, grateful and motherly, a good mother, indulgent. “What did you think it would be like?” But she knew. In our private Legolands we are the only human people. “I’ll tell you what,” she said, and she handed Leo her phone. “You choose. Wherever you want to go, we’ll go. I know Vikings aren’t your favorite, but I have a friend at that Viking village—” “What Viking village?” “A Viking village,” she said. “We’ll go at the end of the week. In the meantime, do some research. Plan the next three days. If you want, we can come back to Legoland—” “I’m never going to come back to Legoland,” he said passionately. When our children love what we love, it is a blessing, but O, when they hate what we hate! Denmark was studded with little museums dedicated to misery and wealth and the unpleasant habits of men, and Leo wanted to go to every one. He was warming to the Vikings. There was a kind of gentle boredom to Denmark, which was in itself interesting: archaeological museums whose captions were entirely in Danish, with displays of pottery shards and nails and swords and bits of armor. To become interested in a boring subject was a feat of strength. A splinter of Viking armor was more interesting than the whole suit, to Leo, because even though it was in a plexiglass box it might fit in your pocket. Perhaps he liked bits because of his nearsightedness—now that he had glasses, it was alarming what loomed on the horizon—but entire objects told the entire story, and therefore belonged to everyone. Looking at a piece of a thing, he might think, deduce, discover something nobody ever had, which was all he wanted in the world. They took a ferry to the island of Ærø. In the old shipyard, Leo made rope using a crank-operated machine and, with the help of a blacksmith, forged a plain iron hook. The blacksmith was a lean man with a sad, rectilinear face and hair the color of clapboard. The black iron glowed orange when you put it in the forge, and when you hammered it orange sparks flew off, and then you were left with something so black and solid you couldn’t imagine it had ever been otherwise. They went to the Welfare Museum, three maritime museums, the Danish Railway Museum. Of course, Joanna missed her father, seeing his dullest passions alive in his grandson. Who else could love trains so much that they were still interesting in a museum, where they were robbed of their one power, movement? Not Joanna, but she could love somebody who did. She felt a useless pride in Leo’s peculiar enthusiasms; Leo’s pleasant father liked action movies and video games, like any American boy. Joanna had arrived with three pieces of Danish: Taler du engelsk? (the answer was always, Yes, I do); tak!; and the phrase for “excuse me,” which she remembered because it sounded—she thought it sounded; she had a terrible ear—like “unskilled.” Unskilled! Taler du engelsk? Tak! Soon she picked up the vocabulary of ice cream—Aksel was right, vanilla ice cream in Denmark was hallucinogenically delicious—kugler, vafler, softice, flødeboller. Though a month after they got home Joanna would wake up in the middle of the night wondering, Is the Danish word for thanks pronounced tock or tack? And which pronunciation had she used? The wrong one, she was sure. Aksel’s watch was in her pocket. She’d put it in a Ziploc bag to keep it clean and hadn’t so much as wound it. It wasn’t hers to wind. She liked the weight of it about her person. Did she still love Aksel? No, but the memory of him came in handy sometimes. They found the Souvenir Museum the old-fashioned way, first one roadside sign, then another. The museum was on the grounds of a modest castle. Like Legoland, the name was full of promise. Souvenir: a memory you could buy. A memory you could plan to keep instead of being left with the rubble of what happened. A teenage girl with a drowsy, dowsing head slid a pamphlet across the ticket desk, and then pointed to the door to the museum. Leo opened the pamphlet. The museum was made of six rooms. He was startled to see that the last room was called Forbidden Souvenirs. A year ago Leo might have asked his mother what Forbidden Souvenirs meant. Now he was seized with a terrible, private fear that he didn’t want her to disturb or dispel. He read books about war; his mother didn’t. Soldiers took souvenirs: ears, teeth, shrunken heads, scalps. His mother, innocent, admired the first glass case, which was filled with salt and pepper shakers. Two Scottish terriers, black and white. One Scottish terrier (salt) lifting its leg in front of a red fire hydrant (pepper). The next glass case was also filled with salt and pepper shakers. There was a density to the collection that felt like a headache, or the physical manifestation of dementia, where the simplest items had to be labeled for meaning: china Eiffel Towers marked Paris, pot-metal London Bridges marked London. It had clearly been somebody’s private collection, a problematic Dane’s hoard. Surely all the salt and pepper shakers had been made in one vast factory in Japan or China, then stamped with geographic locations and shipped off. “After this,” she said, “we’ll go to the Viking village. Your grandfather would have hated this place. What’s the matter?” I don’t want to see, he thought, but also he did. He was stepping into Forbidden Souvenirs. It took him a moment to figure out what he was looking at: coral, ivory, alligator shoes, exotic game of all sorts, pillaged antiquities. “Are you all right?” “Yes,” he said. A faceless mannequin wore a leopard jacket over nothing, its skinny white featureless body obscene. “Grandma had a mink stole,” Joanna said. “I can’t remember what we did with it.” Some of the objects flaunted the original animal: the head of an alligator biting closed a pocketbook, the paws of a white fox dangling from a stole. Was that better or worse than the elephant carved out of an elephant tusk, the tortoise incised into the tortoise shell? “I thought there would be ears,” said Leo. “From the enemy.” “What enemy?” “I don’t know,” said Leo helplessly. “The enemy dead.” “No ears,” said Joanna in an improbably cheery voice. She gestured at the glass case. “Nothing to worry about.” “I wasn’t,” he said. But he had been, the worry was in him, the fear of seeing something he shouldn’t have, human, severed. The feeling was traumatic and precious. “Anyhow,” she said. “Do they pretend there?” he asked. “Do they what where?” “Pretend at the Viking village. Dress up and say they’re Vikings.” “Oh. Not sure. Why?” “The Renaissance fair,” he said darkly. They’d gone to a Ren fair when Leo was four. He’d gotten lost in an iron maze of child-size cages and began to sob—she had a picture of him that she’d taken before noticing the tears—and a man dressed as an executioner had to talk him out, gesturing with his plastic axe. Leo liked to bring it up from time to time, evidence of Joanna’s bad judgment. He liked history. He did not like grown-ups in fancy dress. She said, “It’ll be great.” “That’s what you said about Legoland.” Had she? “Leo—” “I said I didn’t want to go.” “No, you—” “Yes I did,” he said. The words were underlined, she heard it, and later she would understand it as the first sign of adolescence, and she would forgive him, but she didn’t forgive him now. “Well,” she said, “we’re going.” The eyes of a half-dozen taxidermic animals were upon them, as though betting on who’d win the argument and who’d end up in the museum. Then the humans turned and wordlessly went from the room. In the morning they drove to Odin’s Odense, their bags packed in the trunk of the rented car. That night they would go on to Copenhagen, then fly back to the States. Joanna looked in the rearview mirror at sulking Leo. Next year he would be tall enough to ride up front, but for now he was in the back seat. You get to choose, she’d said, and she’d hoped to finagle him into believing that a trip to the Viking village had been his choice. What she’d endured for him! Three days of stultifying museums. They had traveled together beautifully, sleeping in the same room for the first time since his infancy. Ruined now. She knew the ruination she felt was her own treacherous heart. The car’s GPS brought them deeper into the suburbs, red tiled roofs, no businesses. “This doesn’t look right,” said Leo from the back, hopefully. But the GPS knew what it was doing, and there they were. Odin’s Odense. They had to pass through a little un-Viking modern building that housed admissions, a gift shop, and flush toilets. Joanna wondered whether she should ask after Aksel, but what if he had a Viking name? The old woman behind the counter thrust a map at her and frowned encouragingly. The museums of the world are filled with old women, angry that nobody listens to them, their knowledge, their advice. She hadn’t told Leo why they were here, in case it came to nothing. Joanna gave him the map. “Here. It’s in English.” He consulted it and said, casually, “There’s a sacrificial bog.” “That might come in handy.” They walked into the Viking village on one of those days of bright sunshine, the sky so blue, the clouds so snowy white, everything looked fake. Though why was that? Why, when nature is its loveliest, do human beings think it looks most like the work of human beings? Was her detection system still tuned to Aksel’s frequency? At one time, she could walk into any room and know whether he was there. Now she detected nothing. The Viking huts were 89percent thatched, like gnomes in oversize caps. A teenager in a tunic and laced boots ducked out of one, his arms laden with logs. He gave Joanna a dirty look, and she understood that he was mad at his mother, wherever she was, in whatever century, and therefore mad at all mothers. Leo, too. He pointed to a small structure with no roof and said, gloomily, “I think this is the old smithy.” There was nothing smithish about the old smithy. Joanna put her hands on her hips as though she were interested in smithery, though all she could feel was her heart beating warrantless through her body. She knew she and Leo would forgive each other. She knew that it was her duty to solicit forgiveness from everyone, but just then she was tired of men whose feelings were bigger than hers. She felt as though she’d grown up in a cauldron of those feelings and had never gotten out. “Okay. What’s next?” “The medicine woman’s hut.” Inside the medicine woman’s hut, a squinty, hardy-looking woman of about sixty sat on a low bench, stirring an open fire with a stick. “Hej,” said the woman. This was the jaunty way some Danish people said hello, and Joanna always felt exhilarated and frightened saying it back, as though she might pass for Danish a few seconds longer. Which was worse, being found out as an American or as a fraud? It was a big space, illuminated by the fire and the sunlight coming through the front and back doors. The fire was directly underneath the highest part of the thatched ceiling: Viking fire safety. “Say hello,” said Joanna to Leo. A preposterous command. He didn’t. The medicine woman gestured to a low, long bench across from her. In English, in the voice of the Iron Age, the woman said, “Welcome. Where do you stay?” Were they supposed to be ancient, too? Leo tried to feel it. Before Denmark, he hadn’t realized how much he wished to be ancient. To be Danish. To be, he thought now, otherwise for a reason. His mother said, “Last night, near Svendborg.” The medicine woman nodded, as though approving of this wisdom. “It is beautiful there.” She withdrew her stick, inspected the end, stuck it back in. “You have been to Langeland? The ‘big island,’ you would call it?” “No.” She nodded again. “You must.” She was the medicine woman: everything she said had the feel of a cure and a curse. Yes: they would go to the big island. It was inevitable. On the big island, thought Joanna, she might forget her big mistakes; on the big island, they would scatter their memories, if not her father’s ashes. They had not brought his ashes. There were too many of them. “There is an excellent Cold War museum,” the medicine woman said. What was a cold war, in the land of the Vikings? “It has a submarine,” the medicine woman said to Leo. “It is the largest in Europe, I believe. I took my son. Also mini-golf close by. A good place to holiday, if you do not come here. Wouldn’t you like to come to holiday here some day? That is what we do. We put on the clothes and puh! we are Vikings.” “Yes!” Leo said. “You mean, you stay here? You sleep here?” “Of course!” She turned to the corner of the hut and said a sentence or two to a pile of blankets. Perhaps it was an ancient incantation. Nothing happened. She said it again. They could not find a single cognate among the syllables. The pile of blankets shifted. An animal? No. The blankets assembled themselves into a shadow of a man. The shadow became an actual man, sitting up. The actual man was Aksel. He was eleven years older and much thinner, and he had shaved his beard, even though he was now a Viking. He’d always had long squintish eyes; they had acquired luggage. He yawned like a bear, working all the muscles of his jaw; that is, he yawned like Joanna’s long-ago love, the foreigner she’d fallen for when they had worked together on a college production of True West. Joanna had been prop mistress, and had collected twenty-seven working toasters from yard sales and Goodwills. Aksel directed, and had broken every one of those toasters during a single impassioned speech to the actors, sweeping them off a table while declaring, “I don’t want you to act, I want you to react, I want you to get mad.” The medicine woman said, “Aksel’s mother told us you were coming here with the boy.” Joanna nodded. She still didn’t know what millennium they were supposed to be in. “You get mail here?” “She texted.” The medicine woman mimed with her thumbs. “Johanna,” said Aksel. That needless, endearing h. How many time frames was she in? College, mid-twenties, the Iron Age, the turn of the last century. He was recognizable to her—she’d worried he wouldn’t be—and beloved to her too. “What are you doing here?” he asked, in a serious voice. It was a good question. He didn’t look like her father. That might have been what brought her here. The watch could be mailed; Legolands were legion; but where in the world was a man like the man she’d just lost? Her actual heart found the door behind which her metaphorical heart hid; heart dragged heart from its bed and pummeled it. Years ago she’d wondered what, exactly, constituted love—the state of emergency she felt all ten years of their life together? Not that the building was on fire; not that the ship was about to sink; not that the hurricane was just offshore, pulling at the palm trees: the knowledge that, should the worst happen, she had no plan of escape, not a single safety measure; she was flammable, sinkable, rickety, liable to be scrubbed from the map. That feeling was love, she’d thought then, and she thought it now too. “My father died,” she said. “Ah, Walter,” said Aksel, and he rubbed his jaw dolefully. “I am sorry. Recently?” “A year ago. I have something for you. We decided—this is Leo—we decided it was a good time to come to Denmark, to deliver it.” “Hello, Leo,” said Aksel, who looked half in dreamland, populated as it was by ancient Danes, long-ago girlfriends, and preteen American boys. “I am very glad to meet you.” “You know my mom?” said Leo. “That friend I mentioned.” Then to Aksel: “I Facebooked your mom, but I guess you’re off the grid.” “I am very much upon,” he said. “You just don’t know my coordinates.” He looked again at Leo and nudged the medicine woman’s back with his knee. “This is Johanna,” he said of Joanna. “This is Flora,” he said of the medicine woman. “Shall we go for a walk, Johanna? Just for a moment.” The medicine woman turned to Leo. “Do you want to play a game? My son is doing so. Come, he will teach you.” She got up and ushered Leo through the front door, and Joanna and Aksel went out the back, the fire smoking, a fire hazard, but the Vikings must have known what they were doing. “I’ve thought of you often, Johanna,” said Aksel. In the sunlight he was shaggy, his color was not so good, but he was beautiful, a beauty. His clothes smelled of smoke. He seemed a victim of more than recreational Vikinghood. “You’re on vacation,” she said. “I thought perhaps you’d become a professional Viking.” “Ah no. I am a software developer. Flora, she is a foot doctor. And you?” “Bookkeeper.” He nodded. “You were always a keeper of books. Let us discuss what you have brought me.” The minute she pulled the watch from her purse she missed its weight. She opened the Ziploc bag, suddenly worried that watches were supposed to breathe. “Ah!” said Aksel mildly. He took the watch and immediately put it in a pouch he wore tied to his belt, as though any sign of modernity were shameful. “Walter knew I admired this watch. That is what you came to give me?” “It’s what my father wanted you to have.” “And only this.” He started walking and she followed, her long-ago husband, her lost love, to the banks of the sacrificial bog, if bogs had banks. Aksel said, “But not the boy.” “Not the boy what?” “He isn’t my son.” “What? No! He’s ten.” “Ah!” said Aksel. “My mother said you were coming with a boy, and Flora thought maybe. She has a keen sense for these things.” She saw on his face an old emotion, disappointment shading into woe. “What did you think?” He turned to the bog. “I might have liked it. Flora has a son. It might have saved me.” “Saved you? Viking you, or you you?” The bog said nothing. Aksel said, “I can love anyone,” and took her hand. It was the first time he had touched her. A moment ago she’d thought that would be the last step of the spell, the magic word, the wave of the wand. But it wasn’t. I could lie, she thought. She’d never really lied, not like that, a lie you would have to see through, a first step on the road to a hoax, an entirely different life, where facts and dates and numbers would have to be fudged. Leo did exist because of Aksel. He would not otherwise. But then Aksel dropped her hand, as though he’d been joking. “Women are lucky. God puts an end to their foolishness. But men, we are bedeviled till the end of our days.” She said, with as much love as she could muster, quite a lot, “Fuck off.” “All right, Johanna.” “Why did you leave?” “I didn’t want—” But there he stopped. The Viking village was all around them, smoke in the air, the bleating of sheep that didn’t know what millennium they were in, either. Or perhaps they were goats. She couldn’t always tell the difference. “What didn’t you want?” she asked him. He shook his head. “A fuss.” “Jesus. I want the watch back.” “We might have married,” he said. “But then it seemed as though we should have done it at the start.” “Give me the watch. I’ll sacrifice it to the bog.” “It’s worth rather a lot.” “Then Leo should have it. My son. I mean, we spent four hours at the railway museum. I don’t know what I was thinking, giving it to you.” He retrieved the watch from his pouch, his Viking pocketbook, and weighed it in his hand as though he himself would throw it bogward. Instead he wound it up—later, when Leo did become interested in old watches, she would discover this was the worst thing you could do, wind a dormant watch—and displayed it. First he popped open the front to exhibit the handsome porcelain face, the elegant black numbers. “Works,” he remarked. Then he turned it over and opened the back. There, in his palm, a tiny animated scene: a man in a powdered wig, a woman in a milkmaid’s costume, her legs open, his pants down, his tiny pink enamel penis with its red tip tick-tock-ticking at her crotch, also pink and white and red. It was ridiculous what passed for arousing in the old days. She was aroused. “Old Walter,” said Aksel. “He lasted a while, then. He started taking care of himself?” “No. He got worse and worse. He was eighty.” “He never wanted to be,” said Aksel, in a sympathetic voice. “I know it.” He offered the watch. “In four years perhaps your boy will be interested.” Ah, no: it was ruined. Not because of the ticking genitalia, but because it was somebody else’s private joke, and she the cartoon wife wanting in, in a robe and curlers, brandishing a rolling pin. Even a cartoon wife might love her rascal husband. She did. “He wanted you to have it for a reason,” she said. Flora’s son and Leo played a Viking game that involved rolling iron hoops down a hill. Flora’s son was sullen and handsome, with green eyes and licorice breath, terrible at mime, and so he put his hands on Leo’s to demonstrate how to hold the hoop and send it off, then looked Leo in the eyes to see if he’d gotten it, all with a kind of stymied intimacy that Leo understood as a precursor to grown-up love. I will learn Danish, thought Leo. I will never learn Danish. He turned to let the hoop go, and there was his mother, striding up the hill. Bowl her over for ten more minutes with this boy, ten more minutes in the Iron Age—where they had no concept of minutes—ten more minutes of this boy scratching his nose with the back of his wrist then touching the back of Leo’s wrist with his Viking fingers. Bowl her down and stay. No, of course not. The stride told him that they were leaving. Would he have wished her away? Only if he could wish her back later. And would she, Joanna, have wished her beloved Leo away? Only if she could also wish away his memory. To long for him forever would be terrible. “See you later,” said the Viking boy, who spoke English all along, running to gather the hoops.

        "story": "Called out of retirement. Already onto other things. Netflix, Roku haiku, one patient Basho letter at a time. Onto berating the orange sun god, with his changeable guard of hagiographers fanned out in ray formation on TV. Onto tending his garden with a side of memoirs, the ones he got up early not to write. Onto the dog, who smiled more as it aged. Onto the grandchild that his daughter Dina might still have with Eitan, whom he keeps calling Itai. Onto anything other than painting, ever since the school he ran closed, not due to plague but lack of students, because who wants to deal with mineral spirits and linseed oil, with scumbling and impasto, obstinance and failure, when with one click you can capture your world, arrange your face and limbs, your golden light, breakfast still life, your vanity, vanitas, hat, bat, cat, and share it out to the millions who are waiting to respond with all their hearts? Not bitter, no. On the contrary, Harold was still strong in the muscle of joy. He’d come to that place they call acceptance, showed his battered passport, and customs had cocked its head, looked him in the eye, looked down his throat, and finding an absence of bile, let him pass. Finding a man who has accepted, who is accepting, a man ready to take up the butterfly net and catch what can be caught, to look and then let go as the rules require, stamped him on through, and he went out into that overgrown meadow holding nothing, being nothing, sometimes even thinking nothing, at the direction of the meditation app that Dina subscribed him to for his seventieth birthday. And being nothing, he occasionally found himself a conduit for joy. Unowned joy, unclaimed joy, not his joy but the greater Joy that from time to time passed through him, and which he knew better than to try to hold on to. And it was there, already across the border and on the other side, that he was called back. Told that his skills—his skillz, as Itai would have it—could be employed or deployed, could be helpful, in this time of need. That is what Harold had understood. And so he returned to customs, and the guard with the lazy eye checked his paperwork for immunity, put an X through the retirement stamp he’d formerly given him, handed him back his oil paints, and deported him, so that Harold, retired painter and recent survivor of a contagion that took so many but not him, could be pressed into service to sit with the dead before burial, and paint their portraits for the families not allowed to be present when they’d passed. Early one April morning, while he was seeding the grass, his cell phone rang, and who was it but the president, not He of the Tremendous Light, but the president of the synagogue where Harold’s wife, Letty, has been active, and Harold an occasional backrow attender and perennial grumbler, for forty years. To what do I owe the privilege, Marty, he said, clamping the phone between ear and shoulder the better to go on dragging his rake across the soil, Did I forget to send in the check for annual dues? But what Marty wanted was more abstract than money, though like money it had kept him up all night. The rabbi, heavily quarantined with his heart condition and his asthma, had Zoomed with Marty, the assistant rabbi, and the cantor to discuss how best to manage funerals and support the grieving in the absence of any ability to gather. Two separate issues, said Marty, giving Harold the takeaway: 1) the practical matters of preparing and protecting the body between death and burial, and of the burial itself, and 2) the spiritual matters of honoring the dead and giving comfort to the mourners. Practically speaking, the traditional preparation would have to be done by the funeral homes as usual. Some were already refusing, those owned by the large Texas corporation that over the past twenty years had bought up most of the Jewish and many of the non-Jewish funeral homes in New York one by one, with a business model that left only their names, so that no one knew that I.J.Morris was no longer I.J.Morris, that Hirsch and Sons was no longer Hirsch and Sons, that Schwartz Brothers was no longer Schwartz Brothers, Marty said, even though I.J.Morris and Hirsch and the Schwartz brothers had themselves long ago died, and the phones all rang through to corporate. But there were still a few family-owned ones left that not even a plague could keep from performing the ritual purification they’d done for generations, and the rabbi would direct families to these. Zoom would allow for the rabbi’s virtual presence graveside, where the assistant rabbi would hold the phone and gallery-view in the mourners. Here Marty paused and coughed, a fact they both passed over in silence. That left the matter of the shomrim, the volunteers from the community who watch over and honor the dead between death and burial, and the question of novel forms of comfort for these novel times of dying at a distance, dying alone, with its concomitant guilt, frustration, and grief, above and beyond the usual portions. And there, where the need for watching and honoring and giving comfort converged, Marty had thought of him. Thought of Harold, who’d gone to his daughter’s in Brooklyn for dinner, had shared a plate of nachos with Itai, just off a plane from Hong Kong, and then been among the first in their community to fall ill—who’d tested positive and been down for twelve days, and would have ended up at the hospital had his nephew the doctor not arranged for oxygen, or dead but for the grace of God—and so was also among the first to recover. Harold, the retired painter with his immunity and his shuttered painting school near the harbor, where for thirty-five years he taught thousands of students to paint with oils, eight by eight, which is how many he could comfortably fit in the studio at one time. Taught them, under high windows that let down the northern light, how to handle the medium, how to prime their canvases and mix their colors, taught them imprimatura, drybrush, underpainting, grisaille, but mostly taught them, tried to teach them, how to see. What do you say? said Marty, who’d had this stroke of brilliance at 3 am but had waited until eight to call Harold, at which point he caught him scattering grass seed. Now Harold put down the bag of seed, leaned the rake against the fence, and sinking down into one of the collapsible deck chairs he’d yesterday dragged up from the basement, said, Come again, Marty? And so once more, cutting in and out on the overused wireless network, fending off an incoming FaceTime, Marty, macher of their congregation, beloved president for a decade, Marty with his devotion and his charisma and his cancer survival, outlined for Harold the idea that had come to him in the early hours of the morning while pacing his darkened living room and listening to the wail of a siren fade toward North Shore Hospital. He himself had often served as one of the shomrim, a practice that had evolved in ancient times, when it was believed that death was not the end of experience, so that it fell to the living to ameliorate the pain of the dead, both physical and spiritual. As long as there was flesh, it was believed that the flesh continued to feel, and so the body had to be treated with care. And the soul, the shocked soul that remained either unaware or unconvinced of the body’s death, and was believed to hover for three days before beginning its journey to the next world, should not be left alone in its confusion. Marty couldn’t volunteer now, not with the throat cancer he had only just barely survived last year. Nor could so many others in the community, old and vulnerable or afraid as they were. But Harold could, couldn’t he? Being over the illness? Harold, who each year donated to the temple fundraiser a portrait to go to the highest bidder, for which the bids were always high, Marty added, very high? Or so Harold heard on his end of the call. And yet, regardless of what he heard or didn’t hear, why did he go along with it? Why, without asking a single question, before even hanging up the call, did he inwardly commit to Marty’s strange proposal, inwardly agree? Why, when at any moment he could have said what anyone might have said: that sitting with a corpse wasn’t for him, and also, who would want a portrait of a dead person? In Harold’s defense—and in Marty’s defense, if Harold had understood him correctly—it can be said that in the face of helplessness, in the face of despair, they’d both longed to do something, to be useful, and that longing was stronger than every argument against it. Which is how it was that, for four weeks now, he had been learning again to see. To see the forehead emptied of thoughts, the history of expressions and of sunlight on the skin. To see repose, to see form moving toward the abstract. To see—if he was lucky, if we are lucky—to see what is liminal, what lingers or loiters in the wake of a life. At Gutterman’s in Woodbury they knew Harold now. The one who promised to look, to really look, on the one who would be looked at for the last time. The staff brought him into the cold back room, and he was greeted by the volunteer who sat and watched before him, or the person who’d just finished the ritual washing: the buckets of water poured, the wiping with warm cloths, the cleaning of the nails, the combing of the hair. No words were ever spoken. The door closed and they were gone, leaving Harold alone with the deceased, who lay covered on the metal table, and their long night together began. I’m learning to see. He remembered reading that line in a paperback when he was twenty-two. Lying on his back in the grass, looking up at the Dutch clouds sailing past and being overwhelmed, totally overwhelmed, at being spoken to in that way. As if the writer, who claimed to be learning to see, was seeing him, as if a sentence had been assembled and a meaning forged for him especially, as if his world of being had been recognized and called out in those five simple words translated from the German. There’s a sweet spot for that sort of youthful revelation, for the shock of feeling seen by the seers, and he was squarely in it then, abroad for the first time, wide-eyed, impressionable as foil, learning to see the surface of things and also what was beneath, to see for himself and beyond himself, peeling the world open only to discover it looking back at him, knowing what he was better than he did. Or anyway that’s how it felt to Harold that day almost fifty years ago near the Amstel, on his back, the rolls of bleached clouds unfurling, the flatness of the landscape everywhere forever in all directions almost vertiginous, as if all that he’d taken to be true could abruptly break off, leaving him to plummet like one of Rilke’s angels, or Wile E. Coyote. He was learning how to look, learning how to see! All ostensibly for the sake of learning how to paint, to be a painter, so that he could see and paint anew, which he took to involve both lucidity and a vision, both seeing what is there and not yet there, i.e., what is yet to come. And learning to see and sketching what he saw, Harold saw a lot of women. Some he drew without ever approaching, and some he drew while talking with. Some he spoke to and afterwards drew, some he slept with. But only to one did he attempt to convey his still inarticulate theory about how learning to see might also involve (require?) learning to love. Amenable to the idea after three nights on the floor of her friend’s apartment in Montparnasse, Marika let Harold follow her back to Amsterdam, and for a little while, until she tired of him, he lived with her in her student apartment at the top of a house in the neighborhood of De Pijp, two rooms with sloping floors and seventeenth-century light. Marika spent most of her days at the library studying for her exams, and after walking her there he’d go off, with his sketchbook and a sandwich of butter and hagelslag, to see the Rembrandts and Vermeers and van Ruisdaels, painted at a moment when all of the Netherlands, with their optics and microscopes and camera obscuras, was also learning how to see. Sometimes he didn’t know the person who had died, sometimes he did. Sometimes it was the parent of someone he knew; once it was Mel Greenwald, whom Letty and he had gotten to know on the temple’s trip to Israel in 2003 (friendly, brassy Mel atop Masada, Mel grinning at Ben-Gurion’s grave, the-world-is-too-much-with-us Mel bargaining in sunglasses—bargaining for sunglasses?—in the shuk). And a week ago it was Mrs.Kovner, Dina’s preschool teacher, who thirty some-odd years ago let his daughter rule the block corner with a kippah askew on her little head, which she refused to take off in an early rash of feminism. Mrs.Kovner who every day greeted Dina at the classroom door, and every day sent her home again one day closer to her life, to the largeness of the life that awaited her, that awaited all of Mrs.Kovner’s little people, year after year, decade after decade, until at last, after introducing two generations to the alphabet, to numbers, to fairness and justice and the blessing over the challah, to thank you and sorry and don’t hit people over the head, Mrs. Kovner retired, with a ceremony funded by the Sisterhood. Mrs. Kovner who died alone, and whom Harold wanted to paint the way that Mantegna painted Christ, violently foreshortened, seen from her pierced and wrinkled soles, so dead, so recklessly human. In better times, when there were more volunteers to sit, each would stay for only an hour or two, then be replaced by another. But as there were so few now, Harold got into the habit of taking the whole night. Around 6am, just after someone from the funeral home arrived to relieve him, Marty would call. That Marty didn’t sleep was something Harold had not known about him. Sleep was beyond him now. He’d catch Harold just as he came out into the dawn and ask how he was. Okay, Harold would tell him, I’m good, relieved to hear another voice, to share with someone the sharpness of living. And maybe Marty was also relieved to be on the other side of another sleepless night. Harold would walk slowly, still dazed, toward the car, carrying the small wooden pochade box that held his paint tubes and the wet panel. So how did it go? Marty would ask, and for a moment Harold would think of all the things he might have meant by the question. Would think of telling Marty about the Mantegna that he couldn’t get out of his head, and the seventeenth-century paintings of anatomy lessons also haunted by the dead Christ, the greatest and strangest of them painted by Rembrandt in 1632. Okay, he’d tell Marty, good. And Marty would nod, Harold could hear him nod, Marty in his kitchen looking out at the trees in rinsed morning light. Marty who only went out, in his gloves and mask, to get a takeaway coffee when he couldn’t stand it anymore being shut in, closed off from the world whose contagiousness he’d always loved. He never asked Harold about the paintings, and Harold never spoke of them. Maybe he thought Marty would ask for them later, to give to the families when time had passed and the moment was right. Or maybe Harold came to believe that what was really wanted of him was the watching and the seeing, not the pictures that came of it. Twelve of them altogether now, posthumous faces to the wall in his studio. On the drive home after the night he spent with Mrs.Kovner, Harold called Dina. Dina who was also awake at dawn, because even the end of the world wouldn’t keep his daughter from her briefs, her cases. From her Williamsburg apartment she gazed down on the East River. The gray water, the black water, the blue water, all the same to Dinaleh, who saw it only as something between her and her Midtown firm. And ever since she met him and he came home with her and never left, Itai also gazed down on that ever-changing river. But unlike Dina who was born on the island and grew up in the shadow of the city, Itai must all that time have been trying to understand where that river flowed from and where it flowed to, must have been trying to work out in his Middle Eastern head how all of watery New York geography fit together. Now he was often gone all day long, Dina told Harold, driving and driving, smoking out the window, tracing arcs of harbor, ocean, wetlands, beach, estuary, marsh. Now that he was out of work and the roads were empty and you could get anywhere in the true time it really took to get to those places, Itai was flying: skirting the Belt and Shore Parkways, cruising Far Rockaway, hugging the Jamaica Bay wetlands, where the waterbirds wheeled in the sky, boring down the Jersey Shore from the Highlands all the way to the boardwalks of Asbury Park, then back up through Fresh Kills, where the mountains of trash had been carpeted with grass and stairways of compacted trash cut to heaven. He came home wild-eyed and windswept, mask dangling, speaking of the mansions of the Syrian Jews in Deal, of the Mafia in Staten Island, of the delicacy of causeways. Mrs. Kovner, Harold said, do you remember her? Dina reached back, far, far back to the blurry realm of childhood, and remembered. And moved, tired from the long night alone with flesh and soul, he told Dina about the guarding and the looking, and the portraits that came of it. There was a long silence. Then his daughter said, Wait, that’s what you’ve been doing? They asked you to do that? And as she said it, Harold’s stomach contracted and he felt regret at having said anything. Isn’t that a little creepy? she said. I mean, who’s going to want a painting like that? she asked, switching over to speakerphone so that the riverine spaciousness of her apartment was suddenly audible, ambient. Before Harold could reply, Itai’s voice floated in to offer his opinion. He disagreed. Think about it, said Itai: 95million images are shared on Instagram every day, and not one of them is of the thing that every network, news source, government official, every everybody, is talking about nonstop. We’re obsessively counting the dead, minute by minute, updating the number of corpses, without ever looking at them. The only witnesses for pictures of the dead are computers that wipe them out before they can ever get posted. Imagewise, it’s the elephant in the room, said Itai, taking a noisy slurp of his power shake. But here’s your dad, doing it. And he might be the only one, you know, so maybe go easy on him? A rare warm feeling for his daughter’s boyfriend spread through Harold. Perhaps the two of them would go for a drive together along the coastal roads, the windows down, the ocean vast, and he would tell Itai what until then he hadn’t been able to say, even to himself: That at the age of seventy, having long ago given up on ambition, he’d found a subject that he knew he would never be equal to, and it made him less afraid, to sit quietly and paint what everyone fails in front of. That morning someone from the funeral home, a member of the staff that offered the utmost in sensitivity and professionalism, as was printed in the brochures, stopped to ask him what was in it, that box he always carried. Harold looked back at him. He looked into his small, wet eyes, eyes inured to the sight of death, and asked a question in return. Why is it, said Harold, that no one ever speaks in front of the deceased? And the Gutterman staff recited the ancient reasoning: One shouldn’t mock the dead by doing in their presence what they can no longer do themselves. Which is everything, murmured Harold. The staff nodded, glancing down again at Harold’s paint-spattered box. He pulled into his driveway and stood inhaling the smell of blooming trees. The sky that over the years had grown lousy with jet planes on their way to Kennedy was empty, the street silent but for the birds, and the dog inside the house—happy creature that knows nothing beyond its expertise—wildly barking at Harold’s arrival. He took the pochade box from the passenger seat and carried it inside. The dog smiled in the doorway. Letty slept on upstairs. Harold carried the box to the small room at the back of the house, closed the door behind him, and took out the painting of Mrs. Kovner. In the morning light he took up his work again, looking at all that can no longer look back.

        "story": "The Dogman snuck back from the bar with two Kölsches and stuck one in front of me. An old gesture. Old for us, old for history. “I quit drinking,” I said to him. “You did? I keep forgetting.” I was in a dark mood. The Dogman had been forgetting all week long, ordering two drinks and planting one before me, expressing mock astonishment at my refusal of it before downing both himself as though it were an imposition. He thought it was funny. The Dogman had a mean sense of humor. This was two months after an Amtrak train derailed in Port Richmond and killed eight people, and the Dogman was still making jokes about seeing the ghosts of dead commuters. “I guess I’ll drink it for you.” He extradited my Kölsch to his side of the table. “Don’t worry about paying me. I make good money.” He said this every time. Every single time. The Dogman was an accountant in the Philadelphia office of one of the country’s largest banks. It was, by any measure, a boring job, with a modest salary, but the Dogman presented himself like a Wall Street bond trader from 1987, a figure of surplus and insouciance. Maybe he was, but only compared with me. I’d just taken a job as a delivery driver for a catering company and was therefore a man to be pitied. My life was not as I’d imagined it. “You know, Monk,” said the Dogman. “I heard that alcoholism isn’t even a real thing. Like, you can only even get it if it runs in your family.” “That isn’t true,” I said patiently. “And it does run in my family.” “Oh. Well.” When outmaneuvered, the Dogman retreated to his fallback position, which was grinning like an idiot. “What does it matter if you’re a drunk, though, with your job?” “I have to drive a van, for one.” The Dogman grinned wider. “Didn’t stop that Amtrak engineer.” Marc Dogana wasn’t an idiot, per se. Some people possess an emotional intelligence, and that was perhaps the sort of intelligence that the Dogman lacked. He also lacked common sense. He wasn’t terribly book smart, either. He had a business major’s disdain for objective truth. He offered a lot of opinions that sounded as though he had spent some time on their crafting, but which revealed themselves to be pretty asinine if you thought about them for more than a second. I’ll say it like this: Some people might call the Dogman an idiot. Not me, though. Me and the Dogman were friends. And by friends, I don’t mean that we liked each other. I mean that we had, for a period of our lives, spent a lot of time drinking together and had never formally become enemies. It would have required too much effort to be his enemy. I was staying in his apartment for the time being and mostly tried to be polite. “If you’re not drinking, that means I’m drinking by myself,” said the Dogman. “Which is a warning sign of alcoholism. So, think about the danger you’re putting me in.” It was because of the drinking that my memories of college were hazy. The hows and whys of any one friendship eluded me. I believe I met the Dogman when a girl at a basement party threw a cup of vodka into both our sets of eyes. I never received an explanation, but if I had to guess I’d say she was aiming for the eyes of the Dogman alone, and that I was simply collateral damage, condemned by the section of floor on which fate had led me to stand. Our eyeballs burned, and it was with that burning that my friendship with the Dogman was cauterized. “We should sue the shit out of her,” he’d advised, perhaps as an activity to further bond us. “I know all about that yak. Her family is finished in Montgomery County.” These were the sort of things that the Dogman said. “Why are we here?” I asked, watching the Dogman sip his Kölsches, one then the other so that their levels remained equal, while he peered around the room as though expecting a visitor. The Dogman had asked me to meet him in the Victory, a cavernous corporate sports bar that looked not unlike a pavilion at a Renaissance fair. We were seated at a standard four-top, but the massive refectory tables that ran the length of the hall could have accommodated fifty people each. There were not nearly that number present. There were barely any people at all. The Victory was housed within a larger complex of bars. A mall of bars. The complex was named for the local internet provider and sat on the infinite plain of parking lots in deep South Philadelphia that ring the city’s sports stadiums. Only malefactors would drink in such a bar on a Tuesday night if they weren’t waiting for a game to start. We weren’t waiting for a game to start. “It’s a surprise,” said the Dogman. “A surprise guest.” I didn’t care for the sound of that. There was no living person whose arrival would please me. If I knew them, I didn’t want to see them. Reunions had lost their novelty. I had already reached my point of saturation with the Dogman. I wondered whether the bar served coffee. The decor—the tables, the Eagles banners, the bouquets of beer taps springing from every surface—suggested that the consumption of anything without booze in it was categorically discouraged. “Okay, I’ll tell you, because I’m a little nervous,” said the Dogman. “We’re meeting Sudimack. Steve Sudimack, from school. You goddamn lungfish.” I did not want to see Steve Sudimack. “Huh.” “Are you excited? He called me out of the blue. He’s moving back to Philadelphia.” “Is he still unstable?” “Why did you agree to meet him at all? Why did you answer the phone?” The Dogman sat with his mouth ajar, as though the idea of refusing a call was anathema to his truest being. “Because it’s Sudimack. From school.” He grinned. “You gotta be there for your friends, Monk.” Steve Sudimack, the Dogman reminded me, had dropped out of college senior year when the girl with whom he had been sleeping informed him that she was pregnant. The girl, Sonia, had herself dropped out the year before but was still loitering in North Philadelphia, going to parties and trying to “latch onto some dickhead like a remora” (to use the Dogman’s phrase). Sudimack was that dickhead. He packed up Sonia and their collective possessions in his busted Mercury sedan and drove them to his parents’ house in Scranton. The Dogman had a clear memory of the event because Sudimack had called him from a gas station outside Allentown to keen over the loss of his future. “I just laughed at him,” remembered the Dogman. “I told him to wrap it up. Get it?” The kid, Jayden, was born that fall. For the past four years, Sudimack and Sonia had lived in a cramped basement apartment, him doing contract work with his father and her cashiering part-time at Gerrity’s, raising their child in an environment that was surely characterized primarily by angst and hostility, beneath the mocking slate skies of Lackawanna County. Then, one Saturday in early July, when the sun was hot and the cocktails were strong, Sonia got hammered and revealed that young Jayden was not actually Sudimack’s son. Sonia had been sleeping with another man at the time, and that man, when faced with the prospect of fatherhood, had mustered the cruel pragmatism necessary to tell Sonia to fuck off. She had gone to Sudimack next. And had Sudimack reacted in the same fashion, there was a third man Sonia could have gone to, and even a fourth. Sudimack, predictably, lost his shit. Tables were flipped. Cops were called. When tempers eventually cooled and blood-alcohol levels lowered, Sonia attempted to retract her admission, but Sudimack nevertheless demanded a paternity test. Three days later, when the results came back negative, Sudimack again called up the Dogman, this time to lament the needless sacrifice of four years of his youth and affirm his desire to return immediately to Philadelphia. “I just laughed again,” said the Dogman. “What an asshole.” “When was this?” I asked. “This was today. This was like three o’clock.” “Wow. So this is pretty fresh for him.” “Four years fresh,” said the Dogman, finishing his second Kölsch. “I would have gotten the test done the first day that toad tried to swindle me with her little miracle. Here, I think this is him now.” The Dogman nodded toward the entrance, where a compact figure had just stepped in from the night. Sudimack strode through the bar like a conquering general, his short legs chopping briskly in a pair of maroon sweatpants. Sudimack wore a white tank top, like he had just come from the gym. Sudimack did not, by the look of it, give a single fuck. My initial instinct was to go rigid and hope that Sudimack would fail to notice us, but the Dogman gave us away. “Look at this gullible Scranton-ass cuckold.” Sudimack raised his index finger, suggesting that we wait a moment. He made a beeline for the bar. “Getting straight to business,” the Dogman whispered, loosening his necktie. “Classic Sudimack.” I had witnessed half a dozen of Sudimack’s altercations back in college, usually from across a room, usually with no knowledge of what had caused them, not while they were happening and not afterward. You would hear a scream or something break, look up, and there would be Sudimack locked in with another guy, one or both of them bloodied, a crowd of people shuffling backward, forming a circle, ogling the spectacle. Sudimack wasn’t particularly strong, nor was he particularly adept at landing a punch. What he had was a willingness to make use of the tools that he found in the environment: keys, ashtrays, Ping-Pong paddles, fire extinguishers. Glassware was a go-to. It did so much more damage than you’d expect. Even an inconsiderate brawler knows not to fight that way, if only because it can easily land you in prison. This near-pathological disregard for consequence was what set Sudimack apart. “Sudimack, you remember Dennis Monk?” asked the Dogman as the guest of honor arrived at our table, a trio of whiskey tumblers clutched like an oblation in his hands. “Not till we do this,” said Sudimack. “I don’t drink,” I said, as one of the glasses slid in place before me. “What?” Sudimack spat the word as though the near-empty bar was so full of music and noise that the very notion that I would even attempt to communicate with him was a source of irritation. “Alcoholic,” said the Dogman, nodding at me. “What is this?” demanded Sudimack. “I thought we were unwinding.” He pulled the three tumblers back toward him and started downing them. “It’s just Monk who has the problem.” The Dogman reached for his erstwhile whiskey. “I’m still drinking.” “Well why don’t you fucking buy a round for fucking once, you cock?” demanded Sudimack, his voice rising to a shout. He poured the contents of the last glass down his throat. Then he flipped the four-top. It turned out that, on his way to Philadelphia, Sudimack had stopped in Bethlehem to buy a handful of Dexedrine capsules, which were making him a bit fidgety. He now wanted some methamphetamine and was more than a little annoyed that the Dogman didn’t have any on hand. I could tell that the Dogman was genuinely offended that Sudimack would think that he, an accountant at the Philadelphia branch of one of the nation’s largest banks, would be in possession of a drug that everyone knew was for hayseeds, and yet the Dogman suffered from the tragic flaw of always wanting to please those whom he identified as greater bullies than himself. It was therefore decided that we should go acquire some meth, and that I should drive, since I was sober. It wasn’t as though we were welcome in the Victory any longer. “You really shouldn’t have flipped that table,” I said, peering at Sudimack in the rearview mirror. It was the Dogman’s car, a leased Cadillac, and Sudimack struck a discordant image perched in its backseat with his sweatpants and Dexy jitters. I wasn’t annoyed that he had provided me with a useful excuse for never returning to the Victory, but being forced to run out of an establishment at age twenty-six was an unflattering reminder of the ever-deteriorating quality of my social circle. “I’ve been flipping a lot of tables lately,” said Sudimack. With the stadium lights illuminating half his face, he appeared to be caught in a moment of genuine reflection. “You know who flipped tables?” asked the Dogman, grinning. “Jesus. In the temple.” Whatever reaction the Dogman hoped to get for that observation, we offered only silence. “And you know who got tricked into raising somebody else’s kid?” The Dogman turned in his seat to face Sudimack. “Joseph. What a fucking idiot, right guys?” Like a viper, Sudimack’s arm shot forward and bashed the Dogman in his nose. The latter flopped back toward the dashboard. “Fuck,” he cried. “It was a joke, you shithead.” A runnel of blood dribbled from the Dogman’s nostril. I drove east on Pattison Avenue through the flat expanse of industrial lots, for no other reason than I had nothing else to do and nowhere else to go. I resented the Dogman for putting us in this position, on a quest for methamphetamine with an emotionally unstable coal cracker glowering at us from the backseat. It was not Sudimack’s self-destructive urges that bothered me (from my point of view, abetting his acquisition of meth was not markedly different from abetting the Dogman’s acquisition of Kölsch), but I would have preferred not to do anything that would put me on the wrong side of the law. Criminality was not sober behavior. I was wondering what the chances were of convincing Sudimack to go to a diner instead and fill his emptiness with black coffee and a corned beef special when he started tapping on his window. “This looks good. Pull over here.” We were stopped on the old trolley tracks a few dozen yards from the Delaware Expressway overpass. Through a hole in the fence, a group of figures was partially visible in the reflected glow of a Tastykake billboard. “When I get to the fence, flash the lights a few times so they know people are waiting for me,” said Sudimack, opening his door. He slammed it with a bang and stalked off through the weeds. “We should ditch him,” said the Dogman. He was pinching his nose shut, attempting to stanch the blood with the fabric of his necktie. He sounded like a goose. “This is the middle of nowhere.” I flicked the headlights per Sudimack’s instructions. “You’re the one who called him your friend.” “That was before he broke my nose,” honked the Dogman. “That bear is bad news. I wish he had taken an Amtrak down here, if you know what I mean.” I thought back to our reunion the week prior. I had been carrying a crate of boxed lunches through a cubicle bay in an office building in Center City when I heard a familiar denigration: “Is that drunk-ass Dennis Monk?” The Dogman followed me to the street for a cigarette (he had an engraved holder, of course) and cackled with delight to hear of the many misfortunes, earned and unearned, that had stalked me since the end of college. “Did your buddy Denhelder really die of diabetes?” he’d asked, his grin as wide as the Walt Whitman Bridge. “I heard that from Seamus, but I thought he might be fucking with me.” “Why would he fuck with you about that?” I asked, but the Dogman waved the question off into the breeze of Market Street. When he discovered that I was without a permanent address—I’d left Maureen in a lonely huff and was again sleeping on Ivan’s couch—the Dogman offered to sublet me the spare room in his apartment at a rate that had yet to be determined. “It’ll be just like college,” he insisted. “I’ll give you a break until I can get you a gig here, data entry or some shit, and you can stop bringing people lunch.” Caught in a pink fugue of reconciliatory goodwill, I’d accepted the proposal, already inanely picturing an engraved cigarette holder of my own, even as I knew that such holders were markers of the exact sort of people with whom I could never get along. Now the Dogman and I were sitting in an idling Cadillac, waiting for drugs, one of us bleeding from the head. Somewhere in the night a train whistle droned like a banshee heralding our mundane doom. Sudimack reemerged into the light of the trolley tracks, cuts checkering his face and blood spouting from his lip. He hurried back into the car. “That didn’t work,” he said, securing the door behind him. “They beat the shit out of me. Drive. Drive.” One of the developments of my sobriety (which still felt, at eight months, quite new) was that I found myself traversing a landscape of undulating sentiment. Some days I walked the streets of Philadelphia like a pilgrim in the alleys of Jerusalem, humbled by the inimitable majesty of life, finding every joy and every sorrow experienced by any person I might meet (or see, or learn of) innately and gloriously accessible. Other days Philadelphia was just Philadelphia, and I was a miser, discerning nothing pitiable in any human being besides his ignorance of my own tribulations. Thus on one day I could be overcome with gratitude and optimism at something as meager as an offer to share an apartment with Marc Dogana, only to feel, less than a week later, apathetic as to whether he and Sudimack made it through the night with all their blood still inside their bodies. I was, day to day, recalibrating myself for a new world. The process was ongoing. The Dogman knew a guy on Ritner Street who sold cocaine out of his row house. “How’s that sound, Sudimack?” he asked the battered malcontent in the backseat. “Would coke be alright?” “I guess so,” came the response. The dealer’s block was crowded and bright. Strands of Christmas lights crisscrossed the street between the houses, fat multicolored bulbs suspended like angels, offering their glow to the pedestrians who crept in twos and threes along the pavement. There seemed to be a party going on in one of the houses. A door shuddered open and shut. A yellow window fluttered with the movement of bodies. From the wrong side of the street I could hear the muffled babble of conversation, but no music. I thought the party might be our destination, but the Dogman stopped before another house across the way and banged his fist beneath the peephole. The door opened a few inches, the chain of the lock taut across the gap. Above the chain, a face floated like a moon and frowned. “Attilio.” The Dogman spread his arms in the pantomime of embrace. “Remember me? The Dogman? I came by with Shishkin those two times?” It was difficult to tell from Attilio’s expression whether he remembered the Dogman or not. Perhaps the issue was that during his previous visits the Dogman had been without a streak of blood dabbed from his nose down to the end of his dangling necktie. “Why are you bloody?” asked Attilio through the gap. “Somebody fuck you up?” “Nah, we were playing rugby.” The Dogman grinned like a mule. “Why don’t you let us in? It’s warm out here.” Attilio considered us for a moment and then unfastened the lock. We followed him through a living room of plastic-coated furniture and artificial flowers, past a looming grandfather clock whose face told the wrong time by many hours, and down the steps to the finished basement out of which Attilio managed his business. There was a small refrigerator and a wall-mounted television and an aquarium with some sort of reptile curled in the corner. There were two parallel couches with a glass coffee table between them. Attilio ushered the three of us onto one of the couches: Sudimack, then the Dogman, then me. He sat on the other, lit a cigarette, and subjected the Dogman to a probing stare. The Dogman stared back. “How’s Shishkin?” asked Attilio. “I actually haven’t seen him in a while,” said the Dogman. “Have you?” “No.” “He’s kind of an asshole. Like, he’s ...” The Dogman clicked his tongue sadly. “I don’t know, he just says mean things sometimes—” “You got meth?” asked Sudimack. Illuminated beneath the recessed white lighting of the basement, Sudimack’s face was a crime scene. He had a deep gash across one of his eyebrows, where a swollen ridge was forming above the socket. He had a sooty scrape across his cheek where it looked as though his head had been dragged against asphalt. His lip continued to bleed, and he continued to wipe at it with the collar of his tank top, which had accumulated a ghastly parody of a lipstick stain. “What?” asked Attilio. “Do I have meth?” “We know you don’t have meth.” The Dogman’s voice meant to be assuaging. “If we could get an eight ball, though, that’d be fantastic.” He tapped his finger to the side of his own bruised and puffy nose. Attilio turned to me. I was free from blood and cuts and thus might have looked like the most sensible member of the group. “What do you want?” he asked me. “I don’t want anything,” I said. “I’m sober.” “That’s true,” said the Dogman. “Put a beer in front of him. He won’t drink it.” “So why are you here?” asked Attilio. “Why would you come here if you’re sober?” “Don’t worry about him,” said the Dogman. “He’s the designated driver.” “What the fuck is this, a DUI class?” asked Sudimack. “Bro. Drugs. We have money.” Attilio held a hand up to Sudimack, which I did not consider advisable, though it seemed to confuse Sudimack enough that he stopped speaking. Attilio looked at me. “Why are you here?” In the metaphysical sense, I was there because the world had brought me there. My life had thus far consisted of the world bringing me to various places, sometimes for the best, more often for the worst. I had emotional responses to these places, of course, and to the other people that inhabited them, but complain as I might I mostly just kept floating along to the next thing: the next event, the next phase, the next vista. What else could I do? The most aggressive action I’d ever taken—the act by which I’d most attempted to buck the order of things—was getting sober. Though even that was not an act so much as the cessation of an act. And even sober, the ride continued, through landscapes hospitable and otherwise. When I heard people speak of their great plans, their ambitions, the way they were going to change their lives, I was always dumbfounded. What could you do, really? What could any of us really do? I couldn’t stop time, couldn’t go back, couldn’t divert the flow of the universe. No one could. If there was a key to being a person—a functional person, one who lived a long time in a relatively small amount of pain—it seemed to be doing as little as possible. “I’m just seeing where the evening takes me,” I said. Attilio shook his head. “I can’t help you,” he said to the Dogman. “I don’t have anything.” “Attilio, buddy,” said the Dogman. “Come on. You know me. If you could just—” “I don’t have anything for you. I don’t like him”—Attilio pointed to Sudimack—“and I don’t like him”—Attilio pointed to me—“and I don’t like you. Maybe you’ll come back with Shishkin and I’ll have something for you. But this is weird.” He waved his hand across our triptych. “This makes me uncomfortable.” The Dogman frowned. I laughed. Sudimack pointed at the aquarium. “What kind of lizard is that?” It was the Dogman who flipped the table this time. He had been attempting, with greater and greater adamance, to convince Attilio to sell him an eight ball, but Attilio was too busy protesting the fact that Sudimack had risen and started toward the aquarium in the corner of the room. “Yo, don’t go over there. What are you doing? What’s he doing?” “Attilio,” said the Dogman, as though all the other words in the English language had left his vocabulary. “Attilio. Attilio.” “Don’t go near that tank,” Attilio called. “Yo, Dogboy, you gotta get your friends the fuck out of here—” “Attilio. Attilio. Attilio.” “—before this busted-face freak touches my lizard.” Attilio was shouting now. “So help me God—” When the table flipped, no one was more surprised than me. The Dogman had a temper, but it manifested verbally, never physically. When he shot to his feet, his palms lifting the edge of the glass tabletop, my expression must have been one of pure incredulity. The table hopped a foot into the air, tipped perpendicular, then met the floor with a crash and a hail of shards. Before the pane had completely shattered, Attilio leapt backward onto the seat of his couch. I looked up to see him wielding, as if from nowhere, an eighteen-inch wooden baseball bat. It was the kind they handed out at the ballpark on fan appreciation days. He must have kept it hidden in the couch cushions. I sank lower into my own seat, wondering if Attilio regarded me as an enemy combatant (and if he would be correct to regard me as such). The Dogman was on his feet and therefore posed a greater threat. Standing on the couch, Attilio had a significant height advantage, and the Dogman, who seemed to have run out of ideas after flipping the table, looked very much in danger of having his temple beaten in by a miniature bat. Then Attilio was pelted in the face by his own lizard. The animal flew through the air with such swiftness and precision that it took me a moment to realize that it had been hurled. The Dogman dove at the momentarily confused drug dealer’s knees, knocking him to the floor. Sudimack leapt onto the pile, and I, discerning that my participation was unneeded, ran up the basement stairs and out of the house. The world is, at times, confounding. I stood on Ritner Street beneath an artificial sky strewn with a thousand multicolored Christmas stars, though it was the first week of July. Night is dark and sometimes we let it be dark, and sometimes we drown it in tinted light. Night is lonely and sometimes we let it be lonely, and sometimes we settle it with strangers. Half a dozen people stood across the street, smoking cigarettes before the party house. One of them was holding a steaming paper cup and I could almost smell the coffee. A woman came out of the house and stood on the stoop and said, “Come inside, everybody, we’re starting again.” She looked right at me and said, “Come inside, we’re starting the second half.” I walked across the street, under the lights, and I followed them as they filed through the doorway. What I’d mistaken for a party was actually something more organized, with chairs placed around the living room oriented toward one corner where a space had been cleared for a speaker. About thirty people were finding their seats or filing into the spaces along the walls. I took an empty spot by a window, next to a thin table with a spread of fruit, antipasto, and a carafe of wine. The wine precluded the possibility that I had wandered into an AA meeting. Perhaps it was a prayer group. A real estate seminar. I didn’t care. I helped myself to a cup of black coffee and stood there with my nose in it, the pungent steam rising up and unleashing a wave of tranquility down my spine. An older woman reached over for a napkin, flashing me a beg your pardon smile, and I knew I was in a place of benevolent humanism. The woman from the stoop was playing the role of host, and she stepped into the speaker’s corner with her palms clasped and her eyes gleaming. I inferred from her praises of the previous performers that I had entered some sort of storytelling event, where people got up and talked out an unwritten anecdote from their lives. I did not find that premise immediately appealing, but no one in the room was covered in blood, and that had become an increasingly endearing quality for me over the course of the previous hour. I could withstand a story or two. “Our next performer,” said the host excitedly, “is a South Philadelphia native and a genuine treasure. We’re so lucky to still have her here among us, and so very, very grateful. Please help me in welcoming to the stage our friend Tracey Basilotta.” There was an inordinate amount of clapping as Tracey moved to the speaker’s corner. She must have been a scene favorite. I could sense the simmer of anticipation in the modest audience, the flicker in the attentiveness of the room. She was a small woman, right on the cusp of middle age, her hair and sweater both suggesting the staticky lightness of feathers. She held an apple in one hand, gripping it like a skull, her wrist bent beneath the weight of all its inherent symbolism, and I could tell she was a woman who believed in her own purpose. “This is a new story,” she said. “I’m still figuring out the shape of it. Part of it only happened recently. And, actually, I suppose, it’s still ongoing. Because I myself am ongoing, and life is ongoing, and we don’t yet know what the end looks like.” Around me, people nodded. They appeared so vulnerable in their chairs, so hungry for a narrative that might supersede their own. Tracey cleared her throat. “I was on a train that flew.” Tracey’s story went like this: She was not a successful person. She was not an ambitious person. If she was an intelligent person, it was the kind of intelligence that had never led to any money, which was therefore no kind of intelligence at all. She’d grown up not far from where we sat, on Iseminger Street near Marconi Plaza. She’d grown up with the vague notion of leaving the city, though never with a fixed location in her mind. She ended up in Chicago. It was a school that lured her there, though once that was done she’d struggled to find a reason to stay. A vocation would have served, though she found none. A passion, then, perhaps, though an inventory of herself did not identify one. She was not a skilled person. She was not a talented person. If she was a funny person, it was the sort of funniness that appealed much more to those who understood her intimately than to those who didn’t know her. She had few of those intimate people. She stayed in Chicago anyway. She married a man, though he quickly felt less like an anchor than a millstone. She loved him, yes, but it was relative. Their love was a small love. Greater love was reserved for greater, lovelier couples. She was not a beautiful person. She was not a person whom people remembered once she walked out of a room. If she was notable in any way, it was for the way that others assumed, with very little evidence, that she was dependable. She was forever being asked by acquaintances to water plants, to look after pets. She was forever being listed as a reference for job and apartment and adoption applications. Even though her bills were paid late. Even though she left her husband after an unremarkable weekend in Bayfield, Wisconsin. She was not a dependable person. She was not an organized person. If her life conformed to any recognizable shape, it was simply because she had not found a way to break that shape. A recognizable shape was a mark of smallness. She wanted bigness. She left Chicago. She lived in Seattle. She lived in Boston. She lived in Washington, D.C. Her apartments were so similar to one another that she could not now remember which belonged to which city. She married another man. She left him, too. She took him back, two years later, out of resignation more than anything else. She was not a stubborn person. She was not a steadfast person. If she had any consistency of behavior, it was a tendency to waffle. Which was just a form of inconsistency, when it came down to it. And inconsistency was a trait upon which others could graft whatever tendencies they desired to behold. She left her second husband again. She got a tattoo. She entered a graduate program and dropped out after two semesters. She came home to Philadelphia, where an old friend gave her a stable job. She lived now, again, not far from where we sat, on Randolph Street near Whitman Plaza. And she supposed she was the sort of boring person who was always destined to end up back where she began. And she supposed she was a foolish person to have thought that any other life might lie before her. Even so, she was a person with self-awareness. And she was a person conscious of the brevity of life. And if she kept on living in a way that left her less than satisfied, it was only because there was no other way that she knew how to live. She tried to cook different foods. She tried to date different men. She tried to go different places, to see different neighborhoods in different cities whenever the opportunity arose. Just that May, she had boarded an Amtrak train at 30th Street Station. She had meant to go to New York but ended up, via circumstances that were painfully confusing, no farther from home than a gravelly field in Port Richmond. It was only later, when the events were explained to her, that she was struck by their significance. She had, at four decades and one hundred miles per hour, come to a place where the tracks curved one way and the train went another. It slipped the rails and sailed over air, into nothingness, untethered to the predetermined course of zones and maps and schedules, unconcerned with the laws that governed physics and nature, and it flew—for who is to say that a train cannot fly? Simply because, on all the days that preceded that one, trains had been bound to the earth? But any day, any moment, is new and different from any moment that has ever come before it, because the order of occurrences has not yet solidified into unyielding history. It is still pliable and subject to influence. Subject to improvisation, to spontaneity. To whim. She inhabited a present—a present finite only if one insisted on measuring it in time—and in that present a train could do such unexpected things. It could drive across the empty air as though it were solid as any rail, as though the only thing keeping any of us from liberation is our insistence on hewing to the tracks before us. “And I won’t talk about the way it came down,” said Tracey. “I’m not yet ready to talk about the way it came down, because it hit the earth in a way that I will never forget. But that is not the topic of this story. This is a story about flight.” The room was silent. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the rattle of the air conditioner in the backyard. Tracey held the apple aloft. “We know that it’s the nature of all objects to fall through space. I understand that. I accept it. But one day, in this universe of endless universes, I believe there’s going to be something that doesn’t fall. That doesn’t have to fall. I have to believe that.” She gripped her prop by its stem, and we all looked on, soundlessly, breathlessly, as she let it go. We half expected, half desired, half required with half the fibers in our bodies that the apple would float there once she released it. We watched like children, we idiots. It fell to the floor with a soft crunch as its flesh compacted under the force of its plummet. We laughed. Laughed at ourselves. The tension broke. The spell snapped like a soap bubble. Tracey smiled, shrugged. “So, not tonight. But one day. Thank you, everyone.” I saw them after the applause began, when I cast an investigative glance around the room. They had snuck in during Tracey’s story and were loitering quietly along the back wall. The Dogman’s mouth was now as bloody as his nose, and his shirt was dotted with tiny stained holes where shards of the coffee table had pricked his skin. Sudimack had blood on his knuckles. In his hands he held and absentmindedly stroked Attilio’s pet lizard like a familiar spirit. The two of them were glassy-eyed from whatever substances they had found in the dealer’s basement. They swayed, smiling like lunatics, mutely at the edge of the room. The host returned to the speaking corner and requested another round of applause for Tracey. “These are difficult times,” she said solemnly. “Death and injury seem to come sneaking up in ever more sudden and upsetting ways.” There was a gentle murmur of agreement from the room. I may have murmured along with them. “I thought,” the host continued, “that it might be alleviating in these times to go around and each speak a name of someone we’ve lost. It doesn’t have to be from violence, necessarily, since a loss is always violent. Just someone who has passed from our lives. I’ll begin.” And then she said a name, a name that meant nothing to me, a name that might have meant nothing to anyone in the house other than herself. Tracey, who still stood near the front of the room, said her name next. I didn’t recognize that name either. The remembrance continued through the audience, with strangers saying strange names, and I thought of what name I might say when it came to be my turn. I thought of the dead people I had known. That was the assignment, to name one of them. But, really, I had lost more than dead people. Most of the people I had ever known, most of the people I had ever cared for, had exited my life, and I would only ever know them again if I sought them out and reconciled. Friends and family and people I had loved, whose lives had diverged from mine in sharp and gradual ways. I could have said any of their names and meant them just as much as the names of my dead. I could have said my own name, and the people in that room would not have known. Except for the two who knew me. I looked back at them, their bruised and broken faces. I hated them for knowing me. They were a check on me to remain myself and to never be any other person. How can you change if every mistake and humiliation of your life is folklore for those who witnessed it? An anecdote in the mouths of those whom fate sat on the stool next to you when you were young and brutal and gullible and scared? Dennis Monk was still those things. Why couldn’t I say that he is dead? Why couldn’t I be a new man tomorrow? The remembrance was moving clockwise around the room, and I realized it would reach Sudimack and the Dogman before I had a chance to speak. I realized it before they did, lolling like sunflowers against the wall. I watched as the last anonymous audience members spoke their anonymous names, and then it was Sudimack’s turn. Sudimack, who fought dirty and indiscriminately. Sudimack, who looked so much like a battlefield ghost that I couldn’t believe that no one had tried to escort him from the premises. Sudimack, whose eyes were welling with tears. “Jayden,” he said to the assembled people. “My son. I lost my son today.” In the house there was an intake of breath. I felt it pass my own lips. Next to Sudimack, the Dogman (who had taken possession of Attilio’s lizard and was squeezing it like a leathery doll) wailed with all the muscles in his throat. One of the men sitting nearby reached out and placed a hand on the Dogman’s shoulder. I set my fingers down on the refreshment table to steady myself. “I had a three-year-old son,” said Sudimack, his breath fragmenting into syllable-length gasps, his knuckles clenched and raised to his temples. “And I lost him today. I lost him forever.” “My God,” prayed the host at the front of the room. “You poor man,” sighed Tracey, her voice as soft as feathers. The tracks pull the train out of the station, thread it through the woolen night. Feel its compelled glide along the curves, its fixed orbit, the spine of rails and ties that dictates the arc of cars, the transit of passengers, the order of days, the epochs of a life. Could you stop it with your mind alone? With your shoulder braced against the window? Could you will the flanges to crumple, the wheels to hop the rail? I think we’ll go this way now. This way over here. And with a swat I overturned the table, because there were new poets in town, and I knew that words alone would never satiate them.

        "story": "The man touched the button and his seat moved from its upright position. He found himself staring up at the nearest of the small screens located just below the overhead bin, words and numbers changing with the progress of the flight. Altitude, air temperature, speed, time of arrival. He wanted to sleep but kept on looking. Heure à Paris. Heure à London. “Look,” he said, and the woman nodded faintly but kept on writing in a little blue notebook. He began to recite the words and numbers aloud because it made no sense, it had no effect, if he simply noted the changing details only to lose each one instantly in the twin drones of mind and aircraft. “Okay. Altitude thirty-three thousand and two feet. Nice and precise,” he said. “Température extérieure minus fifty-eight C.” He paused, waiting for her to say Celsius, but she looked at the notebook on the tray table in front of her and then thought a while before continuing to write. “Okay. Time in New York twelve-fifty-five. Doesn’t say am or pm. Not that we have to be told.” Sleep was the point. He needed to sleep. But the words and numbers kept coming. “Arrival time sixteen-thirty-two. Speed four seventy-one mph. Time to destination three thirty-four.” “I’m thinking back to the main course,” she said. “I’m also thinking about the champagne with cranberry juice.” “But you didn’t order it.” “Seemed pretentious. But I’m looking forward to the scones later in the flight.” She was talking and writing simultaneously. “I like to pronounce the word properly,” she said. “An abbreviated letter o. As in scot or trot. Or is it scone as in moan?” He was watching her write. Was she writing what she was saying, what they were both saying? She said, “Celsius. Cap C. It was someone’s name. Can’t recall his first name.” “Okay. What about vitesse. What does vitesse mean?” “I’m thinking about Celsius and his work on the centigrade measurement.” “Then there’s Fahrenheit.” “Him too.” “What does vitesse mean?” “What?” “Vitesse.” “Vitesse. Speed,” she said. “Vitesse. Seven hundred forty-eight K per hour.” His name was Jim Kripps. But for all the hours of this flight, his name was his seat number. This was the rooted procedure, his own, in accordance with the number stamped on his boarding pass. “He was Swedish,” she said. “Who?” “Mr. Celsius.” “Did you sneak a look at your phone?” “You know how these things happen.” “They come swimming out of deep memory. And when the man’s first name comes your way, I will begin to feel the pressure.” “What pressure?” “To produce Mr. Fahrenheit’s first name.” She said, “Go back to your sky-high screen.” “This flight. All the long flights. All the hours. Deeper than boredom.” “Activate your tablet. Watch a movie.” “I feel like talking. No headphone. We both feel like talking.” “No earbuds,” she said. “Talk and write.” She was Jim’s wife, dark-skinned, Tessa Berens, Caribbean-European-Asian origins, a poet whose work appeared often in literary journals. She also spent time, online, as an editor with an advisory group that answered questions from subscribers on subjects ranging from hearing loss to bodily equilibrium to dementia. Here, in the air, much of what the couple said to each other seemed to be a function of some automated process, remarks generated by the nature of airline travel itself. None of the ramblings of people in rooms, in restaurants, where major motion is stilled by gravity, talk free-floating. All these hours over oceans or vast landmasses, sentences trimmed, sort of self-encased, passengers, pilots, cabin attendants, every word forgotten the moment the plane sets down on the tarmac and begins to taxi endlessly toward an unoccupied jetway. He alone would remember some of it, he thought, middle of the night, in bed, images of sleeping people bundled into airline blankets, looking dead, the tall attendant asking if she could refill his wineglass, flight ending, seatbelt sign going off, the sense of release, passengers standing in the aisles, waiting, attendants at the exit, all their thank-yous and nodding heads, the million-mile smiles. “Find a movie. Watch a movie.” “I’m too sleepy. Distance to destination, one thousand six hundred and one miles. Time in London eighteen-o-four. Speed four hundred sixty-five mph. I’m reading whatever appears. Durée du vol three forty-five.” She said, “What time is the game?” “Six-thirty kickoff.” “Do we get home in time?” “Didn’t I read it off the screen? Arrival time whatever whatever.” “We land in Newark, don’t forget.” The game. In another life she might be interested. The flight. She wanted to be where she was going without this intermediate episode. Does anyone like long flights? She clearly was not anyone. “Heure à Paris nineteen-o-eight,” he said. “Heure à London eighteen-o-eight. Speed four hundred sixty-three mph. We just lost two miles per hour.” “Okay I’ll tell you what I’m writing. Simple. Some of the things we saw.” “In what language?” “Elementary English. The cow jumped over the moon.” “We have pamphlets, booklets, entire volumes.” “I need to see it in my handwriting, perhaps twenty years from now, if I’m still alive, and find some missing element, something I don’t see right now, if we’re all still alive, twenty years, ten years.” “Filling time. There’s also that.” “Filling time. Being boring. Living life.” “Okay. Température extérieure minus fifty-seven F,” he said. “I’m doing my best to pronounce elementary French. Distance to destination one thousand five hundred seventy-eight miles. We should have contacted the car service.” “We’ll jump in a taxi.” “All these people, a flight like this. They have cars waiting. The huge scramble at the exits. They know exactly where to go.” “They checked their baggage, most of them, some of them. We did not. Our advantage.” “Time in London eighteen-eleven. Arrival time sixteen-thirty-two. That was the last arrival time. Reassuring, I guess. Time in Paris nineteen-eleven. Altitude thirty-three thousand and three feet. Durée du vol three sixteen.” Saying the words and numbers, speaking, detailing, allowed these indicators to live a while, officially noted, or voluntarily noted—the audible scan, he thought, of where and when. She said, “Close your eyes.” “Okay. Speed four hundred seventy-six miles per hour. Time to destination.” She was right, let’s not check our bags, we can squeeze them into the overhead. He watched the screen and thought about the game, briefly, forgetting who the Titans were playing. Arrival time sixteen-thirty. Température extérieure minus forty-seven C. Time in Paris twenty-thirteen. Altitude thirty-four thousand and two feet. He liked the two feet. Definitely worth noting. Outside air temperature minus fifty-three F. Distance de parcours. The Seahawks, of course. Kripps was a tall man’s name and he was tall, yes, but noncommittally so, and had no trouble meeting his need to be nondescript. He was not a proud head bobbing above a crowd but a hunched figure blessed by anonymity. Then he thought back to the boarding process, all passengers seated finally, meal soon to appear, warm wet towels for the hands, toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, water bottle, pillow to go with the blanket. Did he feel an element of shame in the presence of these features? They’d decided to fly business class despite the expense because the cramped space in tourist on a long flight was a challenge they wanted to avoid this one time. Eye mask, face moisturizer, the cart with wines and liquors that an attendant pushes along the aisle now and then. He watched the dangling screen and what he felt was the nudge of dumb indulgence. He thought of himself as strictly tourist. Planes, trains, restaurants. He never wanted to be well dressed. It seemed the handiwork of a fraudulent second self. Man in the mirror, how impressed he is by the trimness of his image. “Which was the rainy day?” she said. “You’re noting the rainy day in your book of memories. The rainy day, immortalized. The whole point of a holiday is to live it outstandingly. You’ve said this to me. To keep the high points in mind, the vivid moments and hours. The long walks, the great meals, the wine bars, the nightlife.” He wasn’t listening to what he was saying because he knew it was stale air. “Jardin du Luxembourg, Île de la Cité, Notre-Dame, crippled but living. Centre Pompidou. I still have the ticket stub.” “I need to know the rainy day. It’s a question of looking at the notes years from now and seeing the precision, the detail.” “You can’t help yourself.” “I don’t want to help myself,” she said. “All I want to do is get home and look at a blank wall.” “Time to destination one hour twenty-six. I’ll tell you what I can’t remember. The name of this airline. Two weeks ago, starting out, different airline, no bilingual screen.” “But you’re happy about the screen. You like your screen.” “It helps me hide from the noise.” Everything predetermined, a long flight, what we think and say, our immersion in a single sustained overtone, the engine roar, how we accept the need to accommodate it, keep it tolerable even if it isn’t. A seat that adapts to the passenger’s wish for a massage. “Speaking of remember. I remember now,” she said. “What?” “Came out of nowhere. Anders.” “Anders.” “The first name of Mr.Celsius.” “Anders,” he said. “Anders Celsius.” She found this satisfying. Came out of nowhere. There is almost nothing left of nowhere. When a missing fact emerges without digital assistance, each person announces it to the other while looking off into a remote distance, the otherworld of what was known and lost. “Children on this flight. Well behaved,” he said. “They know they’re not in economy. They sense their responsibility.” She spoke and wrote simultaneously, head down. “Okay. Altitude ten thousand three hundred sixty-four feet. Time in New York fifteen-o-two.” “Except we’re going to Newark.” “We don’t have to see every minute of the game.” “I don’t.” “I don’t,” he said. “Of course you do.” He decided to sleep for half an hour or until an attendant showed up with a snack before they landed. Tea and sweets. The plane began to bounce side to side. He knew that he was supposed to ignore this and that Tessa was supposed to shrug and say, Smooth ride up to now. The seatbelt sign flashed red. He tightened his seatbelt and looked at the screen while she went into a deeper crouch, her body nearly folding into her notebook. The bouncing became severe, altitude, air temperature, speed, he kept reading the screen but saying nothing. They were drowning in noise. A woman came staggering down the aisle, returning to the front row after a visit to the toilet, grabbing seatbacks for balance. Voices on the intercom, one of the pilots in French and then one of the attendants in English, and he thought that he might resume reading aloud from the screen but decided this would be a case of witless persistence in the midst of mental and physical distress. She was looking at him now, not writing just looking, and it occurred to him that he ought to move his seat to its upright position. She was already upright and she slid her food tray into the slot and put her notebook and pen in the seat pocket. A massive knocking somewhere below them. The screen went blank. Pilot speaking French, no English follow-up. Jim gripped the arms of his seat and then checked Tessa’s seatbelt and retightened his. He imagined that every passenger was looking straight ahead into the six o’clock news, at home, on Channel 4, waiting for word of their crashed airliner. “Are we afraid?” she said. He let this question hover, thinking tea and sweets, tea and sweets.

        "story": "The exhibit had been up for three weeks when the trouble started. As soon as Cliff arrived at the gallery that afternoon, Georgina got up from the stool where they were allowed to rest during their shifts and stepped toward him. Her bronze dreadlocks were in an architectural bun. She cocked it at the woman in front of the painting. “Been here all morning,” Georgina whispered, her eyebrows curving up, her lips down. The draped figure stood before the painting with her head at an angle, her hip kinked to one side. A stance of interest. While groups or pairs of visitors clustered briefly, murmuring and pointing, before moving on to the next piece, individual visitors often paused this way to take in a painting. But this one persisted. She stayed staring at just that one work of art until the gallery closed three hours later. Cliff sat on the stool, facing her. At one point, he subtly pulled out his phone to confirm he was thinking of the right word for what she was wearing. Yes, it was a burqa. This one looked cheap, the color and texture of the black tablecloths they used for the gallery openings. That wasn’t what made Cliff suspicious, though. It was her eyes, tick-tocking to and fro behind the mesh like one of those vintage cat clocks. Before each opening, Cliff liked to walk around the exhibits in case a patron should ask him later for the location of a work of art, or for his opinion of one. (Only white men ever asked his opinion, but he loved seeing them squint with confusion when he gave it.) Cliff would take his time, shifting from artwork to artwork. Then he read, letting the names and dates and details of each placard seep into the sketch of his first impression, as if filling it in. He’d already done that initial meander with this exhibit, which was called Black Matt(h)er. He remembered only that the painting the woman stood in front of all day was titled Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith—the names rang a bell, but only a faint one—and that it commemorated their deaths. When the burqa woman left at 6pm, Cliff stepped over to the painting again and reread the placard. The artist, Sonia Middleton, was South African. Cliff nodded at the word “intersectionality,” which he’d heard enough about on gallery tours to connect to his mother’s favorite saying: “The nigger woman is the mule of the world.” He reread the word “chiaroscuro,” the definition of which Cliff had heard plenty too, from the art history students who worked as docents; it meant light and dark, white and black. Middleton’s painting fit the label, and it was big, running from a couple feet above the floor to a couple feet below the ceiling. Cliff’s feeling, on this second close viewing, was that it was pretty—it reminded him of willow trees or the end of a sad song—but nothing special. The burqa woman returned the next day. “She’s baaack,” Georgina buzzed in Cliff’s ear as she passed, dreads in banana bunches today. The woman was again in front of the painting, but instead of standing, she was sitting on the floor. This offended Cliff. It looked primitive or maybe just dirty. That floor got a professional cleaning only every other week, allegedly because the gallery couldn’t afford a janitor. Sitting on the floor seemed at odds with all that the burqa implied. But there were no rules against it, technically, so Cliff just stayed on his stool and monitored the situation. From a certain angle, it looked like the woman was part of the painting, a short black shadow watching the long black shadows streaking the field of white. Camouflaged as she was, she still drew more attention sitting down. Other visitors to the gallery stared or whispered or exaggeratedly skirted her on the floor. At one point, a woman with red hair—dyed badly on purpose, Cliff thought, and cut unevenly, an old-school New York chic—leaned down and spoke to her. Cliff was too far away to hear what was said. But the burqa woman tilted her head up, and he saw the cloth bulge, her cheekbone lifting as she replied. The redhead started back with disgust and walked off, her transparent heels hoofing loudly. The burqa woman again stayed in front of the painting all day, without even a break to use the bathroom. Cliff planned to ask Georgina about it—should they tell management?—but when he arrived for his shift the next day, Georgina wasn’t sitting on the stool. Her dreads were in curly-fry ringlets, and she was standing over the burqa woman, and they were yelling at each other. Cliff told me and Mike all of this later. Cliff and Mike had met at the opening of Black Matt(h)er. Basically, Mike had tried to do his usual thing—get into a work situation sideways—which, in this case, had involved meeting this new gallerist, who, Mike had heard, was looking for a curator for a show in Prague called Dada Africa, Black Dada, Blada Blada. Mike had pitched up at the gallery in Chinatown, glanced briefly at the art, flirted platonically with everyone, downed a lot of free cava, and ended up at a bar down the street with Cliff, after they literally shut down the party together, pulling the shutter closed and padlocking it to the sidewalk. Cliff looked like he was in his forties and was actually fifty-three; Mike, the reverse. They drank whiskey and Cokes, and chatted about the cost of rent. Cliff had lived all over Manhattan but had recently moved back into his childhood home in the Bronx with his mother, who had been a librarian back in the day and was now just “like, the flesh part of a breathing machine” (Mike’s words to me). The conversation got a little sad. Mike had a great time, though. He always does. He didn’t get the Prague gig and he forgot all about it until the furor hit. Someone had tweeted a photo of the burqa woman, with the hashtags #ArtOfProtest and #AppreciationOrAppropriation. This was when her presence first got called a “protest.” Think pieces sprouted like mushrooms overnight. A Moroccan-American artist named Christianne LaBlanc put up a petition titled “STOLEN [IM]PROPERTY,” stating that her “SISTER IN HIJAB” was right: the painting should be “DEMOLISHED.” It was not only the grotesque commodification of a horrifically violent event—the lynching of the titular Shipp and Smith in Marion, Indiana, on August 7, 1930—but also the neo-imperial art-world theft of a traumatic history that didn’t “BELONG” to a white South African woman at all. Some people signed LaBlanc’s petition, but for the most part it just got dissected, line by line, on various media, both news and social. Artists and pundits took LaBlanc to task for her naïveté. C’mon now. Art didn’t belong to anyone. The painting’s abstraction, which LaBlanc had called “A PRETTIFICATION OF BLOOD TERROR,” couldn’t really be faulted; a realist depiction of lynching could easily have been considered worse. And to call for the destruction of art in an era like this was particularly tone-deaf, conjuring the specter of Nazis and Fascists. This was not the time for us to attack one another. The Arts were already under attack. As was Civility. And Democracy. People coolly criticized LaBlanc, but no one felt comfortable criticizing the burqa woman who’d sparked the whole controversy and who kept asserting, to Georgina and later to the police, that she had a First Amendment right to be there. She wasn’t breaking any rules. She wasn’t bothering anyone or instigating violence. She was just sitting in a gallery. This is, I think, where Cliff picked up the word “interesting,” which the woman kept using in her arguments, e.g., “I’m just expressing my interest in this work of art. I just find it interesting.” Fair enough. Blocking the painting from view seemed insufficient grounds for people to drag her. What if she got arrested for this, or even deported? This last fear, of course, presumed she wasn’t a U.S.citizen. But who knew? She had an American accent, invoked the American Constitution. She could have been a white convert, or a member of the Nation of Islam. But no one had asked. Nor had anyone asked whether there was any relationship between her veil and her protest. It seemed impolite to bring it up. The painting wasn’t just a painting. It was a painting of a postcard of a photograph. I thought about the first time I saw Andy Warhol’s Green Coca-Cola Bottles projected on a screen during an Art and Thought of the Cold War class. In 1962, Warhol wasn’t yet sending his images through his proto-Instagram color filters, turning them garish green or blue or red, so the Duchampian gesture—an ordinary object framed by the museum effect—still had a certain clarity and simplicity. I hummed with pleasure before the image of those stalwart bottles, with their distinctive bishop-piece shape, greenish, blackish, stacked high and wide. I thought of a military battery and also, oddly, of the famous slave ship blueprint. In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Walter Benjamin wrote about “the presence of the original” work of art, which was essential to what he called its “aura,” a kind of glow: “the earliest artworks originated in the service of a ritual—first the magical, then the religious kind.” For Benjamin, mechanical reproduction such as photography creates copies of the original that don’t require us to be present before it. This depletes its aura, wearing it away like the nose of a statue that we rub for luck. Warhol parodied mechanical reproduction by painting racks of a commercial product on a canvas. But the duplication, I think, actually gives aura back to the painting, lends it a new kind of glow. This isn’t even the beatific glow of the grocery store refrigerator, though. It’s the warehouse at the back, the area behind the grimy plastic blinds, the fluorescent lights stark overhead, where the crates of empties are collected before being returned to the factory to be refilled. Or, at least that’s what they did in Zambia in the Eighties. I don’t know what they did in America in the Sixties. I know what I know about the aura of a Coke bottle because I’ve seen The Gods Must Be Crazy six or seven times on VHS. The film, like me, was born in 1980, and, like the painter Sonia Middleton, is South African. It begins when an empty Coca-Cola bottle gets thrown out of an airplane and lands, unbroken, in the Kalahari at the feet of Xi, a San man. His tribe decides it must be a gift from the gods; it cannot be shared; it breeds conflict. Xi decides to walk to the edge of the world and dispose of it. The film becomes a buffoonish picaresque through the desert, bouncing along with antic slapstick and racism. It’s as if the bottle had been tossed from the peak of Coca-Cola’s 1971 “Hilltop” advertisement—with its multicultural confetti of faces, its offer to “buy the world a Coke”—all the way down to the bathetic valley of what the world really thinks about black people. That Coke bottle still became iconic for us, a joke my Zambian friends and I riffed on, despite the condescension in the idea that an African tribe would treat it as sacred. The thing is, a Coke bottle does have aura. It is like an original work of art, with its swooping lines and shapely anthropomorphic figure. In the world of the film, its double singularity—it is both unique and alone—is in fact what makes it sacred. Another way to put it is that there would have been no movie if another Coke bottle had fallen from the sky. Under pressure, the white South African artist Sonia Middleton released a semi-conciliatory statement on the homepage of her spartan website. The statement was short, a little impersonal. She said that she had never planned to sell the painting. She gestured vaguely toward parallels between apartheid and Jim Crow. She argued for art’s role as “instigation.” She asked that her work stay up in the gallery “to keep the conversation going.” Then, her website got hacked. The background flashed red behind big white block letters: i drink black blood for my breakfast! That “my” in the second line seemed less than idiomatic. I was peering at my laptop screen, wondering whether the hackers were American, when I heard a soft chime. Mike was gchatting me: what do you think of this gallery conflagratio? I see Le Blanc’s general point but to stage a protest slash petition slash reputational gofundme seems stupid and boring to me I am myself put off by the framing\nif LaBlanc’s move hadn’t been “you, power structure, should destroy this painting,” I would be straightforwardly and comfortably ambivalent, what with my temperamental post-Jesuit leeriness of grandstanding, which is in turn already heightened by the expansion of opportunities to grandstand provided by mass social media bandstandery and also by my advancing age omg shut up you are not old mike! of course what I would most prefer is that she or her likest-minded would have just gone into the show and destroyed or defaced the painting themselves Nazi\nJK! JK! No no no I know I’m just saying we can’t really advocate for the destruction of paintings in this day and age I mean it’s not CENSORship it’s not NOT censorship I just think destroying it would mean putting herself on the hook\ndefacing the defaced over effacement\nthe shock, charge, horror of it\nthe ... sacred terrorism of it? you are once again losing yourself in the battle\nhey don’t you know that security guard at the gallery? should we go down there and see what’s up? of course! The ellipsis in the chat window pulsed. plus I heard there’s even more burqa now. burqas? burqae? woot! Three more protesters had indeed joined the sit-in. Tourists were visiting the gallery in droves to see them, not the painting. Journalists waited to pick off selfie-takers for interviews. We showed up in the midst of this circus of rubberneckers: short brown me and tall white Mike, who is Mexican and shaped like a candle flame and looks like Jesus, if Jesus had lived long enough to go gray. A few patrons were pretending to ignore the chaos but most milled unabashedly close to the protest. Their smartphones made clicking, scything sounds, as if someone had amplified a fleet of butterflies. My stomach whimpered—we’d had dumplings for lunch a couple of blocks over—and I covered it with my hand. I peered between bystanders, trying to suss out the protesters, who had stopped speaking to anyone at all. There they were, an assembly of dark figures, a parliament of ravens, a ... bouquet of burqas? The very fact of there being more than one lent the whole situation a dubious air. It felt stagy, in a community-theater kind of way. The tints of their black coverings differed slightly. They sat with their backs to the room, ostensibly looking at the painting, though they must have memorized every paint streak by now. Cliff stood in parade rest position between them and the crowd. He looked a bit like Method Man. His uniform consisted of navy pants, a navy tie, a spiky silver badge, and a shirt in that shade of periwinkle that screams “not a real cop.” His elbows made wings. “’Sup, man.” Mike walked up and introduced me. “’Sup.” Cliff nodded languidly in my direction and shuffled his heels. “How’s Ma?” Cliff’s brow softened. “Not bad, not bad. My cousin Gloria been helping out.” “Amazing!” Mike smiled and they nodded. “So ... what’s the deal with all this?” “Free speech, I guess.” Cliff shrugged. “What do you think of it, Cliff?” I leaned in. “Do you find the painting offensive?” Cliff thought. “It’s interesting,” he said, not for the last time. The creases around his forehead and mouth rippled as he tried to explain. “I ain’t think much of it, you know, when I first saw it but I been looking at it, you know,” he said, glancing over his shoulder at the painting, the protesters, “when all y’all are gone for the day? And it is interesting.” My belly mewled quietly. “I mean...” Cliff frowned, then leaned in to speak confidentially. “We got a lotta black folk dying right now, you know? Out there.” “Uh, yeah,” said Mike, waving his El Greco hands. “It’s a fucking genocide.” “It’s kinda messed up in that sense to picture the dead, maybe? But. It is interesting.” This, I thought, was the exact opposite of what Kant had said about the correct approach to art. I was quiet as they continued their conversation though. Melanin is a kind of aura that fades in reproduction. Cliff had the most, mulatta me the next, Mexican Mike the least. My brownness had validated Mike. You can be real with us, my skin had said to Cliff. But if I opened my mouth now and started holding forth about Kant or Benjamin, I’d seem show-offy or condescending, and that would disturb the balmy vibe of solidarity. So while the guys palavered about police brutality, I stood there thinking about Kant on my own—the idea that the pleasure we take in beauty ought to be disinterested, that it shouldn’t result from the satisfaction of a desire. I had always disliked the puritanical bent to this as a philosophical dictum: How do you explain taste then, Kant? What about money, Kant? What about pleasure? I stared past Cliff’s nodding head at the painting, trying to sense whether it had any aura left. It was difficult in the crowded gallery, with the other art and people competing for my attention. I shifted focus, making my vision blur like it was a Magic Eye poster, like it would somehow crystallize into a clear image. I was looking for the postcard in the painting, seeking the true horror of its pale, murky background—the white people’s faces brimming with ... desire? Satisfaction? Interest? My eyes kept bouncing between the two black figures hanging like rag dolls in the painting and the hunched protesters on the floor, near-identical in their black burqas. I felt more dizzy than awed. If mechanical reproduction empties out aura, drains it like a punctured vessel, can the work of art get a refill? Mike and I went back to the gallery a few weeks later. We had started our day at the Rose Reading Room at the New York Public Library to work. As usual, we sat across from each other with our laptops at one of the long tables. Undaunted by the trompe l’oeil ceilings and arched windows and walls of leather-bound books, indifferent to the echoey hush and the tapping of keys like a spring shower of diligence around us, we proceeded to have a full-blown conversation over gchat. We typed replies in tandem, muffling our laughter, which just grew worse for the muffling, like catching the giggles in a lecture. Eyes flashed and rolled around us. We are truly insufferable people. I started keeping track of when our LOLs onscreen matched our real ones. Finally, we succumbed to the peer pressure and started “working.” Except I couldn’t stop reading about the painting and the protest and the petition. A Facebook post here, a Twitter rant there, semi-autobiographical essayistic digressions about art and capital, this or that polished writer, black or brown or white, weighing in on this tiny, enormous debate, this teacup storm for the ages. The think pieces all felt solidly constructed but huddled around their blind spots, like buildings with hidden courtyards. Feeling an irritable déjà vu, I closed the overlapping cascade of open tabs in my browser and landed on the window for the bare-bones eBay auction for Sonia Middleton’s painting. Someone had posted it a couple of days earlier: ***minstrelsy for sale*** over a blurry cell-phone picture of the painting. The bidding had now reached the mid–six figures and was steadily ticking up. I gchatted the link to Mike. holy shit:\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/Lynching-Postcard-Abstract-Painting-Original-Sonia-Middleton/112778552326?hash=item1a3a9d86 Across the table, I saw his eyes goggle cartoonishly, then narrow as he skittered out a flurry of keystrokes punctuated with Return—the telltale sound of googling. I interrupted him: the problem with this whole auction isn’t even the aura\nit’s the indexicality right\nwait what? Primed by my online reading, I began to discourse. The photo of the lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith, I explained in jerky gchat rhythm, had been an index of an actual event. Those men had been brutalized and hung and burnt (had they been burnt? I googled: yes), and that violence had left its mark on a strip of film—real light had hit real people, then a real chemical composition of silver halide. That photograph had then been reproduced in the form of a postcard. Nearly a century later, Sonia Middleton had rendered that reproduction in an elite, organic medium: oil paint. Did this reversal of reproduction sanctify the event or displace it? The paint on her canvas had not touched those bodies, not even transitively. Worse, this lynching postcard had already been reproduced in art several times over now, by Abel Meeropol in his poem “Bitter Fruit,” which became Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit”; by Claudia Rankine in Citizen; by David Powers, whose 2007 mural, American Nocturne, which omitted the lynched bodies, had been protested and taken down, though you could still see it online, in digital photos, another form of mechanical reproduction, whose aura, because of JPEG degradation, is also always already fading ... A new link popped up in my gchat window. Mike had been ignoring my treatise and his googling had turned up a news story about an incident at the gallery. I clicked. Someone had lit the painting on fire! We looked up at each other at the same time, mouthing our mutual WTFs?! The library was closing soon anyway, so we snapped our laptops shut. We headed out with the crowd, making our way down the marble steps, scooped in their centers from the cumulative rub of a million feet. “We have to go, right?” “Of course,” Mike scoffed. “Cliff hasn’t responded to my text yet, though.” “You have his number?” “Oh yeah. I got it at the opening. Also I got drinks with him in Dumbo last week.” “What?! Without me?” The end-of-day murmur echoed in the massive foyer, people already gathering in a curly queue by the exit where the security guard, Sam, was lackadaisically checking bags. “Do you think Cliff was there when it happened?” Not only had Cliff been there, but it turned out that he was the security guard who’d tackled the protester setting fire to the painting! This was, I have to admit, totally thrilling. It was like we had conjured it. First, we had gchatted about how the destruction of the painting would have been the Platonic ideal of protest. Then we had actually gone to the exhibit and seen the burqa bouquet. And then we had been the ones who got Cliff talking about art and value and interest. Not that those conversations were why he’d tackled the protester. That was just his job. It had been two days since the incident—we were outraged that it hadn’t been front-page news—but luckily the painting was still up in its new, compromised condition. A brief announcement concerning the decision to leave it up was posted on the gallery’s website—and taped to its glass front door—but it remained unclear whether this decision was primarily political, artistic, or financial. (The auction continued on eBay.) Mike and I shuffled in with the crowd—fifty or so people, each taking a giggling, shocked turn to witness the burnt work of art. The painting was cordoned off now by short white poles with thin black ropes between them, giving it an air of exclusivity. Even from the distance these ropes imposed, you could see where the bottom right corner of the painting had been torched. It looked like crumbling scabs or a honeycomb of black bubbles in the white paint, surrounded by gray wisps like when an outlet short-circuits. The burn matched the chiaroscuro aesthetic and could easily have been part of Middleton’s original design. Mike and I shuffled off past it and went to stand in front of another, rightfully neglected, painting: an American flag with Beyoncé’s face for stars. We discussed the implications. “With the erased de Kooning, it was at least, like, between friends.” “Didn’t some lady kiss a Rauschenberg?” “That was a Twombly. She said she couldn’t help it. An act of love.” “Ugh. Did Twombly even care?” “Twombly was dead.” “‘Twombly’ is starting to sound weird. Ta-wom-ba-lee.” “It’s not not Seussian.” “Superseussian.” “Someone threw acid on the Mona Lisa in the Fifties.” Mike was on his phone, scrolling through the Wikipedia entry on “Vandalism of art.” “I’m looking for my favorite: KILL KILL KILL on the Guernica ... Ah, it is in fact KILL LIES ALL. Huh! A suffragette knifed a Velázquez!” “Las Meninas?” “No, a Venus. The Rokeby.” “That’s rad. This,” I sent a thumb over my shoulder, “is a tad deflating.” “Like popping a Koons.” My eyes widened. “Or pooping on an Ofili?” “You mean, doubling down on the ... extant poop?” “Band name,” I said absently. “Let’s find Cliff!” Mike said brightly. But Cliff wasn’t there. He’d been told to stay away from the gallery until the civil suits closed. We learned this from Georgina, who was sitting with one butt cheek on the kitchen stool, the other leg stretched out before her. I’d never met her before. She was beautiful, Badu-esque, her thin bronze locks in rose-shaped cupcakes. She struck me as more “authentic” than Cliff. When we explained who we were and how we knew him, she was more than happy to tell us what had happened. Two days ago, Cliff had been standing in his usual spot, protecting the protesters behind him, when he smelled something burning. He turned and noticed the original protester—by now he could recognize the cut and shade of her burqa—standing close to the painting, a little too close for just looking. As he approached, he saw that she was holding a lighter to the bottom right corner of it. “Hey!” he shouted and grabbed at her, but she ducked him and ran off. By the time he started to give chase, she had already tripped over the black cloth at her ankles and gone skidding across the floor. (I pictured patrons gasping and stepping away, afraid that this was a shooting like the one in the Turkish museum.) Once the protester was down, Cliff managed to restrain her, but in the struggle to zip-tie cuffs onto her wrists, her veil had fallen off. When I heard this, I thought immediately of Farkhunda. I’d been idly googling about burqas and protests earlier that week. I’d read about France’s ban, about Denmark’s ban, about burkinis, about how girls had once worn miniskirts in Iran. And I’d learned about Farkhunda Malikzada, a twenty-seven-year-old student of Islam in Kabul. In 2015, she had criticized a fortune-teller for selling blasphemous charms—as well as Viagra and condoms—at a religious shrine called King of Two Swords. In retaliation for this (likely true) accusation, a custodian of the shrine (falsely) accused Farkhunda of setting fire to a Qur’an and leaving the charred remnants in a trash can. He waved the burnt pages around, riled up the crowd, demanded that she be punished. “I am a Muslim, and Muslims do not burn the Qur’an,” Farkhunda responded. Nobody listened. A mob quickly clotted around her—almost all men—and the police were called to take her into custody. First the police shot their guns in the air to disperse the crowd. When this didn’t work, they tried to lift Farkhunda onto a roof, away from the reaching men. After one of the men knocked her down from the building with a piece of timber, the police gave up. Once she was on the ground, the men kicked her, punched her, beat her, tore at her. They drove a car over her. They slammed rocks on her body, breeze-blocks that required great effort to lift. By the time they tried to set what was left of Farkhunda on fire, her clothes were too blood-soaked to burn. The resourceful men threw their own shawls onto her for kindling. Sitting in the 3 am rumple of my bed—nightblack room, moonbright screen, a packet of chips glinting among the sheets—I had followed the links from Twitter to Wikipedia to the darkest corner of the internet: the news. I watched a video that the New York Times had patched together from cell-phone footage taken (cynically? guiltily?) by the men in the crowd. I watched the staggered collapse of Farkhunda’s covered form, its disintegration to a puddled mass, the satisfaction of the men’s desire, the eyes of those smiling lynchers sparkling and spent. The part of the footage that stuck in my mind—and is now forever patched into my ongoing reel of internal despair—is from early in the video. Farkhunda is still alive and surrounded by police. The crowd throngs around them. A man from the mob approaches a policeman. He cups the policeman’s beard tenderly with both hands, as if to kiss him. “Let us take her, please,” the man says, according to the translated closed-captioning. “Brother, let us have her. Why not let us near her?” The ache in his gesture, the word “brother,” the desperate longing to harm her—this is what I can’t shake. You could never paint this: a man clutching another man’s beard, separate yet bound by the shared understanding that would lead a civilian to touch an armed officer in such a presumptive, intimate way, to plead not for mercy, but for the gift of murder. Or, you could paint it, but what would you say in the caption? What frame could possibly help us understand it? At first, the burqa protester had made a big fuss over Cliff’s unveiling—it was an “indecency,” a “violation”—but this was obviated by the fact that she and her fellow protesters weren’t even Muslim. They were white kids from Brooklyn, young artist types. They had been using the burqa as a disguise. Even before that revelation, it was obvious Cliff had done nothing wrong—the veil had slipped off by accident. With no legal grounds for criminal charges, the protester filed a civil suit against the gallery instead. She claimed that setting fire to the painting had been a First Amendment act of protest in defiance of its racism, akin to burning the U.S.flag. She also sued for rights to the painting, claiming that by lighting it on fire, she had “co-created it in its current exhibited condition.” The gallery filed a retaliatory suit for damage to the painting—not only against the protester, but also against Christianne LaBlanc, whose petition was deemed to have incited violence. The painting, of course, was now exponentially more valuable. A month later, Mike texted me to meet him in the Bronx. I thought it was another place on the map that he’d been painstakingly constructing of the best Szechuan in all five boroughs. I clambered out of the subway station into the late-summer heat. We grinned but didn’t hug—he was in his all-black sweat camouflage—and that’s when he told me we were going to visit Cliff. “Cliff?!” I shouted, skipping with delight. “Where the fuck does Cliff live?” I repeated my question in a different tone when Cliff buzzed us in to his building. The linoleum tiles were cracked like an archaeological site. The elevator jolted down violently before it shimmied us up. Cliff greeted us at the door in his civilian clothes. His braided leather belt and tucked-in T-shirt turned his jeans into dad-jeans. He and Mike dapped and I gave him an inappropriately warm hug. He gestured around at the aromas of neighborly cooking in the hallway: “The real melting pot of America,” he grinned half-apologetically. “Goat curry.” We all stepped inside. The curtains were closed, the AC on high. Piles of old magazines lined the foyer. A cat sashayed toward us, cut warning eyes, then twined possessively around Cliff’s calves. He pointed at a door and whispered around his index finger. “Ma’s asleep.” Now I heard the hoarse waves, the crest of beeps. We followed Cliff into the living room: a low glass table, opaque with scratches, and a black sofa, gray with creases. Mike and I sat on the sofa and found ourselves looking at Sonia Middleton’s painting. It was precariously balanced on the mantle of a blocked-up fireplace, extending beyond the bricks on both sides. “Whoa!” Mike said. Cliff went and stood next to it. He grinned and posed for us, one arm across his torso, the other elbow propped on it to pinch his chin musingly. The Thinker on His Feet. “It’s nice, right?” Was it? The table lamp beside me was on, but didn’t glow golden—the eco-friendly bulb was visible under the shade, a tangle of mean white glass. In that harsh light, the painting looked stripped-down, like part of the wall, barely there, barely art. The streaks meant to be bodies could have been stains or rips in the canvas, the burnt corner a mere shadow. Mike stood and approached to examine it. He looked like a bishop to Cliff’s castle. “How did you buy it?” “Get the fuck outta here!” Cliff scoffed. “You think I could afford that? With my ma’s bills?” I felt both better and worse for having thought the same thing. “Nah, man,” Cliff said, grinning. “She gave it to me.” I piped up from the audience. “Middleton?” “Yeah.” Cliff turned to me. “Oh, my bad. Y’all want a drink?” He stepped into the kitchen, still calling out his story. “Yeah, so she came up to me outside the courthouse and she was like, ‘Look, you saved my work. You took that risk. You put yourself on the line for me.’” “Wow!” Mike said genuinely. “Were there cameras?” I asked skeptically. “Yeah, but she didn’t just do it for the publicity or whatever. It was, like, a real present.” Cliff came back into the living room holding three glasses of milk, balancing them by pressing them together like a squat white posy. “So, are you gonna keep it here?” Mike was pointing at the mantle but Cliff didn’t notice. “Nah, man,” he chuckled as he handed us each a glass. “I’m selling that shit on eBay.” We laughed. The sound of Ma’s breathing machine scraped around us. Cliff apologized for the milk, which was all he had. Tap water would have been better but we didn’t say so. We toasted. The milk tasted old—not sour, but sweet and slightly dusty. I woke up this morning to an email on my phone from someone I’ve been having sex with. No subject line, just a link to an essay about Damien Hirst’s use of an Ife sculpture without attribution in his Venice show. I’d already read the essay, so I replied with the dream I had last night instead. I typed it on my iPhone, lying on my side, my screen smeared with hairy-looking smudges. The autocorrect function filled in for my haste and my drowse, translating my typos into malapropisms, which I fixed, my finger skidding staccato to get the cursor in the right spot. A dream, I wrote, is like art. It is an event and a memory both, it is experienced and then recalled. So I want you to read this twice. Once to get a sense of the details and again to feel them all at once. If each detail is a point in a pointillist painting, pretend you’re an ant moving from point to point. Then step back to take in the full effect, or better yet, smack the canvas so the points scatter into the air and form a cloud of particles—ashes of event around you. Also, I wrote, I want you to feel the sleepy chattiness and intimate funk of having just woken up beside me. So imagine my voice whispering this to you, your eyes closed, my lips brushing your ear: There’s a white field, or rather a field of whiteness—sweet, dusty milk—within which a thin black line appears from above, like a drip of bird shit. The line trickles down, tracing the figure of a hanging thing, a man. Cliff hands me a small heavy object made of glass and gold—opera glasses or antique binoculars—and when I look through them, the painting becomes TV fuzz, like sugar falling through water, or like the spritz above a glass of Coke in the sun, or like those smoky bubbles trapped inside the surface of an old mirror. The deck pitches and I drop the opera glasses and I realize that where we are, the gallery, is a ship. (I’m pretty sure that this is my mind punning on the word “galley.”) I cast my eyes over the edge. The water down there is black as ink and the waves drown themselves. One wave tilts into being, shapes itself into a pitchblack arm—a tar baby arm with a fist on its end. A flat silhouette emerges, white eyes surface only to recede again, like Kara Walker is cutting the sea’s planes into paper dolls. A woman behind me on the deck steps forward and asks me to empty my pockets to make sure I haven’t stolen anything. She wears a burqa but it’s not cloth, it’s soot, implicitly it’s built into her skin, and it might be dried blood, a moonscape of scabs, or it might be a brittle weave of mascaraed eyelashes. Farkhunda speaks into my ear but her script carves the air into shapes I can’t read. In despair, she points out at the sea, and so I look.

        "story": "etting past the mastodon took planning. The great plated skull was wedged between the fireplace and the credenza, leaving the two ivory tusks splayed across the carpet where a coffee table belonged. To exit the wedding party, guests either stepped over one tusk, then the other—a choice that required skillful footwork and a certain level of sobriety—or jumped over both with an awkward, last-minute leap. This late in the evening, the leaping had become more frequent. And more flamboyant. Guest after guest soared over the mastodon tusks—feet first, faces joyful, landing in the foyer without the slightest injury to their ankles. At which point they hugged Carter. And asked him how he had met the bride. Or what he loved about her. Or if the two of them had considered ... well ... little Carters and Katrinas! Carter improvised a light, evasive laugh, handed them a bag of candied almonds, and thanked them for coming. Though no one seemed to notice, Katrina had not spoken to or even looked at him since the start of the party. Save during the cake-cutting ceremony, when she had fed him a forkful of frosting that had the same cold, white, dead-flavored consistency as her smile. At this point, she was no longer in the living room. Or anywhere in sight. Carter had said so many things he now regretted, things he would go back and change if only that were possible. Which it wasn’t. Time slogged on, as the mastodon well knew. Both its empty sockets were as expressive as eyes—huge, soulful,slightly depressed. No doubt due to the elephant lurking in its genetics. You never saw an upbeat elephant. They were like donkeys: charismatically morose. The idea of owning such an animal had never occurred to Carter, and his failure of imagination felt more and more as it should have—like a failure. What did a three-piece sectional really say about your understanding of the universe? He and Katrina had a three-piece sectional, plus a matching ottoman that she called a “poof.” “Carter!” said Neil by the fireplace, holding up an empty glass. Carter held up a bag of almonds. Cheers! Several times, he had been tempted to tell Neil about his argument with Katrina. Neil was her oldest friend from childhood. He would know what to do. Or how to make her less upset. He had a swashbuckling kind of generosity, a way of walking through the crowd that inspired laughter or a fresh round of clinking glasses in every group of guests he passed. It was Neil who had dug the mastodon out of the permafrost with a pick and shovel. And Neil who had built his log-cabin mansion—by himself, after work and on the weekends. When he found out that Katrina and Carter had been married in New York—at city hall—he insisted they let him throw a party. In Alaska. With all of Katrina’s hometown friends and neighbors. Now he was heading in Carter’s direction. Carter gave the mastodon a little pat. The skull was polished and warm to the touch. Except where a few chunks of missing bone had been patched with soldered bronze. “Buddy,” said Neil. “Let’s blow the stink off.” “I’m good,” said Carter. “I’m saying our goodbyes.” “Katrina’s ice-skating,” said Neil. “Right in back.” Carter smiled, as if he knew this already. Then followed Neil across the living room, trying to keep up with his discussion about his stepdaughters: Both were towheads. Twins. Competitive figure skaters. Neil stopped at a glass door, slid it open, ushered Carter out to a snowy deck. The cold was soul blasting, fantastical, a gasp of winter in each breath. Neither of them were wearing shoes. Not that Carter mentioned this. “The two of you need to move up here!” said Neil. “We could be neighbors!” Carter nodded—and, for a moment, almost agreed. The lake at the back of the house was glazed with moonlight, the sky a dream astronomy of stars. “Lake ice is too bumpy to skate on,” said Neil. “Even if you flood it and refreeze. Plus you have the air traffic.” He pointed to the tiny planes on skis that were parked along the shoreline, their noses wrapped in padded blankets. “I put in a practice rink for the girls. Moved the helicopter into a hangar.” Which was pricey. Inconvenient. But better vis-à-vis the homeowners’ association. Landing pads in the backyard always upset the neighbors. Carter’s feet were finally numb enough to move. He inched closer to the railing—and could not believe for a moment what he was seeing. Katrina was down on the rink. But skating the way that someone from the tropics might, someone who had never seen a snowflake. Around the wall she went, shuffling and hunched and hesitant, her arms outstretched. The look on her face was unmistakable. Carter knew it well: she hated ice-skating and hated being awful at it but hated quitting more. She would go around and around that rink, miserable and forcing herself on for reasons he could only assume had to do with marching up mountains as a child, and conquering foreign equity markets, and believing, above all else, in pointless personal accomplishment. A belief that he did not share, but did make him feel so tenderly toward her. She was unlike anyone he had ever met. And he had ruined their wedding party. “Katrina?” he said. She looked up, squinting through the floodlights. “Katrina!” said Carter. “I’m ...” But before he could apologize for what he had said and how he had said it—her eyes widened, her skates suddenly kicking out in front of her. Down she went, in a flurry of cocktail dress and flailing limbs. “Are you okay?” said Neil. The way Carter should have, if only he had moved faster, if he could think when his wife was lying on the ice like a blond broken puppet. She sat up. She rubbed the back of her head. “Who makes ice this slippery?” she shouted. “I demand a hot toddy.” Alaska had been Carter’s idea from the start. He had never met Katrina’s father or seen where she’d grown up. Anchorage had sounded exotic—a city with five mountain ranges and a reindeer named Star who lived in a pen downtown. Her father owned a floatplane! Which she knew how to fly! “Let’s wait for summer,” she said, “when we can go fishing. This late in winter, all anybody does is ski and watch TV.” He might have agreed. Except for his job. Back in New York, Carter taught sixth-grade social studies at an all-boys prep school. He loved his co-workers. He loved his kids. And yet, one too many Monday mornings, they had revealed the stunning number of Styrofoam ammo packets they had purchased for their Nerf-gun arsenals over the weekend—a total that when researched and multiplied by unit cost (in secret, on Amazon) surpassed his monthly paycheck. They were clumsy to the point of falling off their stools, these boys—goofy and entitled and egotistical, yet despite the smartphone porn, astonishingly naïve. When Carter had told them he was taking a few weeks off for his honeymoon, they had whacked each other on the arms and rolled their eyes, unable to imagine a future that did not involve marrying your best friend from kindergarten and moving to the desert to invent rocket launchers out of tinfoil and string cheese. On such dreams hydrogen bombs are built—and tested. Thinking back, he might have tried to teach the boys something useful, for once, and explained what had made him fall so thunderously in love. Except he couldn’t. Nobody could. Love was dumbifying. It had no articulation except sex, happiness, and befuddlement. If he had been forced to tell his kids anything, he would have said that Katrina smelled of blackberries from his grandmother’s long-sold house in Connecticut, which wasn’t possible. And yet she did smell of blackberries, dark and heady and warm. He knew the smell, and he couldn’t stop smelling her, touching her, doing things like poking her in the ribs when she was trying to brush her teeth. Add to this: She ate fast-food chicken from the bucket, and flung her drumstick bones on the bedroom floor. She made fantastical amounts of money trading futures for cuntbag asstoys whom she called cuntbag asstoys on the phone, and to their faces. Then turned around and wept over obscure Italian cinema. Or bought him a bunch of violets—violets!—and left them on his pillow while he slept. “Jesus,” said his friends when they found out about the wedding. Carter’s previous girlfriend of five years had been a yoga teacher. A vegan. Katrina, on the other hand, had shot into his life like a blond, carnivorous meteor, and he had married her two months later. She was eleven years older. A few days after they met, she took him swimming at her club, a place with failed teenage models as doormen and a rooftop pool like a chip of fallen sky. She sat on the edge and watched him do laps. When he got out, she said, “You passed.” “Of course I did,” he said. “I graduated summa from Williams.” Then he laughed. But she was serious. She had wanted to see if he put his face in the water. She could not sleep with a man who didn’t, and she couldn’t or wouldn’t explain why. The outrageousness, the bravado—he had thought this was the Alaskan in her. But her father, who actually lived there, was not this way, not at all. They had spent the past three days in Anchorage with him. He lived in a ranch house that had not been updated—as he had mentioned more than once—since 1983. Each morning at 6 am, he ironed his jeans in the kitchen. Each night at 6 pm, he barbecued a chicken on the deck wearing a parka patched with duct tape on the elbows. He served the chicken at the kitchen counter, the only vegetable a bottle of chardonnay. The wine was creamy, French, expensive. The meat was slightly pink with fire-blasted skin. Her father bought both at Costco, which he seemed to frequent hourly. They ate on stools with paper towels for napkins—two half glasses of wine per person and as much chicken as he could load onto your plate. Dinner conversation followed certain rules. They didn’t talk about the ministroke he had had two years earlier, which had cost him his pilot’s license. They didn’t talk about how he continued to fly in secret. Most of all, they didn’t talk about Katrina’s mother and whether or not he had tried to contact her to inform her of her daughter’s marriage. Once or twice, Carter had considered bringing up the subject himself. Katrina’s mother had had a coke problem. She had not solved it. Which was how Katrina had phrased it to Carter in her carefully gray apartment. Her mother had been in and out of the house for most of her childhood. There—and then not. A week, a year, an occasional Christmas. The words came out of Katrina in a monotone, the voice of a government form. And for a minute, Carter thought there might be something wrong with her, until suddenly, as if against her will, a small, terrible smile had flitted across her face—a butterfly of heartbreak. He had waited a few moments, then held her, knowing in that instant that he was going to ask her—fragile and teetering—to marry him, though right then had not been the right time. He asked anyway. While still on his feet, his arms around her, no ring. Tonight, just before Neil’s party, the two topics at dinner had been her father’s use of soy sauce as a marinade and his need to put in a beach. Diamond Lake was a man-made lake, basically a liquid runway, and yet the EPA guys were sniffing around now, requiring homeowners to create “natural habitats” for the salmon, to the tune of ten grand in gravel and plants. “I tell you what,” said her father. “It’s enough to make you want to leave the state.” He shook his head. “Move to New York,” said Katrina, her adoration radiating across the kitchen. “I’ll buy the condo next door, break down the wall.” “We could do that,” he said, shaking his head. “We sure could.” Then he laughed and she laughed and Carter got it: the idea of leaving Alaska was preposterous. Talk like this was just a way of painting the air with the last thing you wanted to do on earth, to ward it off. He served himself another blackened thigh. He thought about the comfort of articulating those kinds of scarecrows—and the danger of them rebelling against your intentions and coming to life. He pictured his father-in-law in a sad, velvet bathrobe, looking out their apartment window at the streets of TriBeCa. It was spring. Dogs in raincoats paraded down the sidewalks, followed by women speaking to invisible cell phones with such intimacy you almost hoped they were talking to themselves. “We should get going,” Carter said. “Right? The party.” Katrina glanced at him. Her father started scraping plates into the compactor. The metal teeth crunched through bottles and bones. Katrina hopped off her stool. Her father wiped his hands on a dish towel—slowly. “Aren’t you coming?” she said, in a shy voice, almost hopeful. Her father looked up, startled. “Oh,” he said. “I didn’t know I was supposed to.” She looked confused. Then Carter was confused. Neil’s party wasn’t a reception, but it was in their honor. An ice sculpture of a leaping king salmon had been ordered. As well as some kind of punch made with blueberries or birch sap. All of which promised to be more exciting, if not more joy filled, than the lunch in Manhattan they had had with Carter’s parents. Both of whom had been too stunned to touch their Cobb salads. His mother had a thing for family weddings, family Christmas cards, family aprons embroidered with each person’s name. “Don’t you want to come?” said Katrina. “It’s just with Neil,” said her father. “And his ... however you call them ... extravaganzas. I wasn’t planning on it.” The expression on his face was kind, but vague, almost presidential, as if they were talking about parking the car or buying groceries, things he didn’t do anymore and had trouble understanding. Katrina picked up a spoon. She picked up a saltshaker. Carter winced. She could be spectacularly articulate when angry—and inventive. Once, when her boss had failed to back her on the purchase of some unorthodox Russian bonds, she had stapled his suit pants to his chair while he napped off a hangover. An act for which she had been rewarded with the title “vindictive fucktard” and a promotion of two bonus levels. “Here’s what I think,” she said. And then she just stopped, mid-sentence, as if chopping off the idea behind it. She hugged her father. “It’s not like it’s a wedding wedding. It’s just some people getting together to celebrate.” Carter looked at her, but there was nothing in her eyes that conflicted with her expression. He sat for a minute. Then said, at a loud volume, “I think you should come.” There was a long, disconcerting silence—save for the grinding of the trash compactor. He washed it away with a gulp of chardonnay. Neither Katrina nor her father looked in his direction. “It’s fine, Dad,” she finally said. “Besides, isn’t the girl from Nebraska singing Phantom?” “‘Angel of Music,’” her father said, his eyes whisking over to the television. “She came in second place last week.” Carter could not prove it, but if he had to guess, Katrina’s father spent every night just how they left him—sitting at his desk, watching America’s Got Talent and tying flies for trout he was going to catch when they weren’t there. Big ones. Rainbows. Monsters. Enter the log-cabin mansion, a five-minute walk down the shoreline through the snow. Just past the mastodon, people lingered by the fireplace with sushi hand rolls and one-bite spoons of risotto, people Carter didn’t know. He always reacted a beat too slowly, and tonight was no exception. “About the girl from Nebraska,” he said. “Ugh,” said Katrina. “I hate a preteen prodigy.” “I’m so proud of you.” She looked at him. “For what?” “For not reacting when your father blew us off.” And yes, he could see by her suddenly cool face, her calm, flat stare, that he should just stop talking. Still he went on, announcing with such easy outrage: Katrina’s father was a grown man. So his own marriage had imploded. Was he afraid that Katrina’s would, too? His staying home from their wedding party—the only one they would ever have—was, if you thought about it, manipulative, selfish. A less-than-obvious control tactic. “Or maybe,” she said, “he’s an introvert who doesn’t like parties.” Then she zipped off her boots—with a sound as brisk and dismissive as her expression—and strode off to the kitchen. Long ago, Carter had understood that some people grasped the power of timing better than others. One of those people was Neil, who swept in at that exact moment, bearing a pint glass filled with single-malt Scotch. “On the house,” he said. “Felicitations.” Carter examined his drink. Three maraschino cherries floated in the potent-smelling liquor—baubles in amber. “My father-in-law has a tab started. Let’s put it on that.” “An amazing man,” said Neil. “A giant outdoorsman. Though slightly rigid.” He was studying Carter, though more smoothly than Katrina’s Manhattan friends, all of whom seemed to flip through his possible ages before speaking: Forty? Thirty-five? Thirty-three? No, no, (no way!), younger. Neil held up his glass, clinked. “He’s still a little emotional with me, I suspect. About last New Year’s.” This past January, he continued, he had been feeling a little down, a little existential. He had buzzed over to Houston, Alaska, in his helicopter and loaded up on cherry bombs and mortars. Then buzzed back home and set them up in a hole on the lake ice, a tad too close to Katrina’s dad’s backyard. Regrettable. As was the single fuse he had used. “What happened?” said Carter. He shook his head, as if implying police, a lost eyeball, a forest fire. Then grabbed Carter by the shoulder, and whispered, “It went boom.” Carter laughed. But Neil only sighed with contentment, the way you might after eating a slice of warm pie. His features were crooked, almost misshapen, his nose a kind of farm potato in the middle of his face. He was not a handsome man, not at all, but you wanted him to be; you were rooting for him in some cosmic way—the cause of which was probably his expression, each freckle a bedazzled star that seemed to convey that he too was knocked out daily by his own good fortune. Carter had a hard time connecting this Neil with the Neil that Katrina had described on their walk to the party. Neil sometimes got wound up, she said. Too wound up. “Like a toddler?” said Carter. “Like someone on an ass-ton of mood stabilizers.” Ten years earlier, Neil’s dad—her dad’s closest friend—had shot himself. In the face. At his fifty-fifth birthday party. It was Neil who found him in the laundry room. And Neil who had tried to clean it up, by himself, to keep his mom from seeing. She had a theory about this, a theory that seemed to apply to everyone except herself and her father: Your average happy person didn’t last in Alaska. It was too much work not to die all the time. About this, Carter only nodded. The Anchorage that he had seen was mostly strip malls and bowling alleys, Denny’s diners and icy boulevards—the mountains looming in the distance, but not exactly putting anyone in the position where they had to crawl around looking for food and a warm cave. And regarding happy people, there were bipolar twelve-year-olds in his classes, billionaire parents on crack, a fellow teacher who had spent six months at Bellevue because he thought a brown recluse lived in his back molar. It was almost relieving that Alaska was similar, that spruce forests and sunsets that looked as if the entire solar system was melting didn’t quite fix the human condition—the way he had believed that nature might during certain, darker periods of his life. Periods he had also not mentioned to Katrina. Ta-da! Neil had made him yet another Scotch with maraschino cherries. “Next time, buddy,” he said, “you’ll come up and stay with us.” He waved to a woman sitting in a leather armchair, knitting a striped, soft-looking blue blanket. “Right, Janice?” he said. “We love to host young lovers. We’ll take you out to the Wrangells. Go scout some wild sheep.” A giddy feeling was swelling in Carter, one that dated back to second grade, when you wanted to ask somebody in your class to be your friend—but knew that to do so would destroy any chance of it happening—and so spent your lonesome, sleepless nights nursing that tender balloon of happiness, trying to figure out how to place yourself in the other boy’s general vicinity, where if you were standoffish enough, he’d pick you to be on his team at recess. This was the secret to Neil, maybe; you didn’t have to feel any of this. He put you on his team the moment he met you. His wife perhaps did not. She smiled—warm but with the guarded eyes Carter often saw in his fellow teachers, who understood that children waltzed off to the next grade and never came back. She was older than Neil, or looked it, her face weathered, her hair a chopped blondish-grayish afterthought. Neil, he had assumed, would be married to someone else, someone tan and ripe and plastic. It was relieving that he wasn’t. Carter raised his pint glass. Janice nodded. It occurred to Carter that she had knitted her way through a lot of parties like this, including ones that went boom. By the time Katrina had pulled off her skates and hobbled inside, all the guests had left—a course that Carter and she could have also followed but didn’t, for reasons they would puzzle over for years to come. At that moment, however, Neil was back behind the log bar. He was serious about Katrina and Carter moving up to Alaska. Intellectually speaking, the state was underemployed. There was a need for people like themselves, go-getters. Now, while the price of oil was high. Carter sat down on the sofa beside his wife. She didn’t move. He put his hand over hers. She let him. Was their fight finally over? Or was she just distracted by the idea of moving back home? An image floated through his mind: him with a bow and arrow, a sheepskin slung over one shoulder, a glacier in the background, a whole bubble life that would melt into nothing, he realized, when he woke up in the morning with a Scotch-and-cherry hangover. Neil continued: He had some ventures on the horizon, some opportunities. His first thought for Carter? Central AC. Sure, it was negative three outside, but you had to understand, he said: in the summers, Alaska now saw eighty-plus temps. He had been working with a young engineer in town on an eco-friendly cooling system that was powered by biofuel made from the byproducts of commercial fishing. Salmon guts, crab shells, etc. “Uh,” Carter said. “I’m not sure that dovetails with my résumé.” Neil filled more pint glasses. “Stem cells, then. I have a doc in town regrowing cartilage for blown knees. Not quite legal, as of now. But promising.” He had other ideas: his chain of adult-care facilities, his IT operation, his health-club franchise, the small-dog grooming business. The profit in small dogs was not to be believed. Carter lay back on the sofa and looked up. Heads and antlers staggered up the log walls to the ceiling, each identified with a brass trophy tag: Dall sheep, mountain goat, gazelle, blesbok. What was a blesbok? And if Carter had been back in New York, wouldn’t he have found it upsetting to see one slapped up on a wall? He couldn’t say. There was something unicorn in all this carnage, something silvery and make-believe and authentic all at the same time. What would Carter have been like if he had grown up with the belief that it was natural—and enjoyable—to go after what he wanted, however off-putting or seemingly impossible? “Stem cells?” he said. “I thought you were a hunting guide.” “The lodge?” said Neil. “Strictly a hobby.” He guided one or two guys a summer—tech kids, mostly, who paid five grand a day to pop a black bear. “It’s a dying industry. But it does cull the numbers in terms of overpopulation.” “Right,” said Carter. “Gross,” said Katrina. “You know how I feel about trophy hunting.” Neil balled up a cocktail napkin, threw it at her. “And yet you still eat chicken. Do you know what goes on in a poultry death camp? I’ve got the YouTube videos.” “Honey,” said Janice. “How many cherries did you just put in that drink?” He looked down. “Nine,” he said, and laughed. “I like them.” “Neil,” said Katrina. “Carter teaches social studies. Like politics. Like government.” “I think of it more as a course in historical-cultural ethics,” said Carter. “What the past can teach us about who we are—and who we want to be.” He paused. “By now most public school curriculums have cut it.” The bitterness in his tone was there, but he was unable to remove it. “Well,” said Janice, back to her knitting. “Both our girls know all the state capitals.” “You can always go back to teaching that mud class,” said Katrina. She slid down the sofa, turned to Janice. “Carter makes a mean coil pot.” He willed himself to look calm, unaffected. The mud class referred to a steaming, impoverished summer three years ago when, out of desperation, he had stooped to working at a day care, crafting projects for toddlers out of a chemical substitute for clay called “magic mud.” Apparently, she was still mad and needed an apology. Which Carter now had zero desire to give her. Then again, the only helpful point he made about her father was that you had to do things for love that you didn’t want to do. So he would then. At the very least, he would earn himself a few minutes of smug moral superiority. “Look,” he whispered, “I was out of line about your dad.” “Don’t worry about it,” she said. “He doesn’t like you either.” The next thing to say was that he didn’t give a crap what her father thought; her father was self-centered and dogmatic and would not let anybody touch his trash compactor buttons; her mother probably did coke just to escape his god-on-high complex. A complex that, by the way, his daughter had not escaped, huddled down on the ground as she was, in daughterly worship. Neil, however, was presenting their drinks on a tray lined with twinkling white doilies. Carter wondered how he would handle this. But Carter knew. He held himself back for a moment. Then flung himself onto the floor at Katrina’s feet and cried out loudly, with great theatrical anguish. “I’m sorry. I was a cuntbag asstoy! Your dad’s a giant.” They all looked at him. Even Janice ceased knitting for a few stitches. “How much exactly,” said Katrina, “did you and Neil drink?” But the fight was over. She had folded. He sat up and kissed her on one bare, waxed, blackberry-smelling knee; her knee always made him think of the inside of her elbow, which always made him think of the inside of her thigh—the soft downy upper reaches. “Now that’s how you run a marriage,” said Neil. “Minus the language. We have growing girls upstairs. This house is strictly rated G.” “It’s Katrina’s expression. She uses it on clients.” “I should have known,” said Neil, shaking his head. And then it happened—Carter saw it happen while still nestled on the lush, creamy wall-to-wall carpet, thinking how wonderful wall-to-wall carpet was, so comfortable on the knees, so cozy, why did no one in New York have it? Neil looked at Katrina and his face went soft and dazed, as if his brain had turned to maple syrup. “You remember that time when you snuck out of the house and jumped off the roof and my brother caught you?” said Neil. “You were supposed to catch me.” “He was older. He pushed me out of the way.” Janice knitted on, briskly, efficiently. “I was fourteen,” said Katrina. “What an arrogant shit I was. My poor old dad.” “You were wearing that skirt,” he said. “With the flowers.” The flowers drifted through his eyes, even Carter could see them—light springtime blooms, pink petals, her feet bare in the grass. All night, Neil had hardly talked to Katrina, save to give the congratulatory toast. He had stayed by Carter. He had introduced him. He had hugged him. He had showed him his archery range in the basement. Which, Carter realized, is exactly what you do when you plan on sleeping with someone else’s wife. You seduce her husband. “I don’t remember,” she said, but in a way that implied she did. Something—the skirt? a summer? a night? a lifetime?—was glistening in the air between them. They were both looking at it, together, the rest of the world on mute. “Oh shoot,” said Janice. “I need more blue. It’s in the basket. Will you?” Neil got up to get the yarn, but Carter was on the floor, closer. He reached in, cutting Neil off. Then he held up the ball and rolled it slowly to Janice’s feet. She had toenails that did not go with the rest of her—a glossy black, chipped. “Did I ever tell you how Janice and I met?” said Neil. “Neil,” she pretend-frowned. “I pulled her out of a ditch. No exaggeration. There she was stuck in the mud in a Ford Fiesta. Her two girls in back. I just happened to be the one lucky guy at Fred Meyer’s. I towed them out. Escorted them home.” “I made you lemonade,” she said. “The lemonade,” he said, his eyes turning to her. Then to Katrina. “I remember standing in that tiny kitchen, thinking how if I could marry a kind, loving woman like her, everything else would be all right.” His voice was husky with feeling. Carter could not believe it. Did she not see that Neil was showing her his tender side? Heroic, sensitive Neil, so emotionally in touch. “You know how we met?” asked Carter. “At a party. We left in a taxi. Ten minutes later we went at it, right in the back seat.” The silence that resulted was majestic, velvety, absolute. “Well,” said Janice, coming to the rescue. “Sex can bring two people together.” Carter was not sure if she was dumb or simply possessed an almost inhuman ability to forgive anyone, himself included. “It’s not like it’s a secret, I guess,” said Katrina. “I’ve always been easy.” “No,” said Neil, with gravitas. “You’ve never been that.” A light came down from on high, a light that Katrina basked in like a Dutch girl from the seventeenth century with a basket of apples. Everything was quiet, except for the pleasant clicking of knitting needles, the soft creak of the house as it shifted against the cold outside. Carter sat there carefully. His hands looked odd to him, as if they belonged to somebody else. “I’ll tell you what we didn’t do,” said Neil. “Give you two a wedding present.” “Absolutely not,” said Katrina, still aglow. “That was the rule, no gifts.” Carter looked back down at his hands. He wondered what his face was doing. He felt as if he were sitting on the rink while they raced around him on diamond ice skates, faster and faster. Going home was not an option. Should Carter suggest it, Katrina might just tell him to go ahead, she’d meet him, later. Ditto to Janice. She had surrendered to her knitting coma years ago. An understandable decision. She had been a single mom with two kids and a compact car to get her through Alaskan winters, a life that was long behind her. “I bet,” said Neil, “you don’t have one Alaskan thing in that fancy New York apartment.” “I bet,” said Katrina, “my apartment is tasteful and understated.” He pointed to a fluffy white skin on the back of the sofa. “It’s yours,” she said. “Correct. And it’s still mine to give.” “Don’t be silly. Besides, they shed.” “I already ordered them something,” said Janice. “Williams Sonoma.” “A waffle maker,” said Neil. He threw back his Scotch. He pulled a leather armchair over to his trophy wall. He took down some antlers—thin, crooked ones. He looked at them as if they were cheap, diseased. He set them on the top of a bookcase. Then pushed the chair over to a set of horns, twisted into thick, lavish curls. They were too high up on the wall. He jumped, as if to swat them down with one hand. “Stop!” said Janice. “Please?” “A waffle maker,” said Neil. But his face was red, his voice agitated. Janice looked over at Carter. There was nothing in her expression. Not a plea for help, not an acknowledgment of their crappy circumstances. “It’s heart-shaped,” she said to the whole room. “Nonstick.” Carter walked over to the mastodon, ran his hand over the front plate of the skull. It was comforting almost, how bone warmed under your fingers, as if a vestige of life still beat inside. “What about the mastodon?” he said. All three of them swiveled their heads—and burst out laughing. “Just a tusk, then,” he said. “The left one maybe. It’s shorter.” “And there I was thinking you were relaxed,” said Neil. “You’re a go-getter, Carter. An alpha where it counts.” Carter smiled—kind of—and started picking up plates. Katrina followed, targeting napkins. It was strange how suddenly a moment could bloom, then just as quickly shrivel up and vanish, poof. So Neil and his wife had possibly screwed their heads off for a teenage summer. Or for a year after college. So it hadn’t washed off. Everyone had their young misguided loves, bronzed by the memory of sex on the family sofa. Every now and then, sometimes even while he was with Katrina, he slipped back in time to Jennifer Larchmont from sophomore year and the hand she used to keep in her lap when she drove him to band practice, the slender possibilities of those fingers, so fluent in clarinet. The kitchen was a blinding arrangement of stainless steel and granite. He placed the dishes on the counter, then stopped at a window over the sink that opened onto the living room. Katrina had a garbage bag out. She tossed in a plastic glass, a smashed bit of cake. Neil bumped into her. Obviously not by accident. “Cut it out,” she said. “Katrina brought a boy home,” he said, in a teasing voice. “Shut up,” she said. Then paused—for a beat too long. “It’s not like he’s a teenager,” she said, finally. “He’s almost twenty-nine.” “He’s an odd one. Dark. I like him.” “I want you to.” Neil tossed in a handful of used napkins. And stopped. “He’ll never leave you, Trina,” he said. “You know that, right?” Katrina nodded, as if not only did she know this, but she also thought it was a wondrous thing, even when she also knew—or should have known, as Neil so clearly did—that there was no love between anyone without the slight, unspoken fear that that love might vanish, or be snatched away by someone else. Carter was younger. He was taller. And stronger. All of which would only work against him if he gave in to the impulse to punch Neil in his supportive, caring face. A door stood next to the refrigerator. It did not look as if it led to the pantry. Carter yanked it open. He walked down a long hallway, opening door after door until he found a bathroom. He sat down on the toilet. He didn’t have to go, but just sitting there with his pants down, cold porcelain on skin, was calming. Underneath every toilet was an invisible river. You just had to focus on it and float away. He reached over for the toilet paper. A baboon stood in his way. It was stuffed and upright and dressed in a loincloth—holding the roll in its leathery, humanish fingers. Of course Neil shot monkeys. He flew over African savannas in his death chopper, lions running from him like deer. The door opened. Carter jerked and clapped his thighs shut. It was Janice. His pants were on the floor. “I’m in here!” he said. But she already knew that. She was in the bathroom. She slid up on the edge of the sink. In the opening of her blouse, the bones on her chest were visible, the skin flecked with sunspots. “Carter?” she said. “What are you doing?” “I’m on the toilet?” She cocked her head. She might not recognize his identifiers: prep-school hair, thrift-store sweater, scholarship parents, younger (anorexic) sister enrolled in grad school for life—but she suddenly seemed well equipped at flicking off a person’s packaging with her eyes. “Neil isn’t well,” she said. “And Katrina isn’t helping.” “He’s trying to fuck her.” “He doesn’t know what fucking is,” she said. She said this without emotion, as if reading a prescription bottle. She got down on her knees. She wedged her hands between his thighs and pried them open. She looked at him—clinically, expressionless—and moved closer. He almost shoved her back into the baboon, but worried about the noise, Katrina hearing, how to explain. Her hands were cold and she was cold and there was something horrible in her, something musky and calculated and mesmerizing and authoritarian. His hard-on arrived without his desire—or consent. He pulled her hands off his legs, held her by the wrists. “I feel sorry for you,” he said. “What you’ve had to do to survive.” “Please,” she said. “Don’t play grown-up.” She whisked his hands away. He let her. She turned and looked at herself in the mirror, fluffed her dull, practical hair. “You know the sad thing about weak people?” she said. “They fall in love with strong ones, thinking they’ll get stronger.” “Get out,” he said. “I mean it.” “But it’s weakness that rubs off,” she said. “On everybody.” Then she smiled—not at him, but at herself, in the mirror, with such hatred. From her pocket, she pulled out a tube of lipstick and smoothed it over the contours of her lips. “Get out, I said. Get out right fucking now.” Janice however, was already at the door. “I guess you’ve already looked underneath the loincloth.” She slid into the hall with a quiet click of the knob. Carter stood up, zipped, tucked in his shirt. Then went over to the baboon, lifted the loincloth. There was nothing there, whatever had been there—male or female—had been chopped off or patched up and you’d have to dig around to tell. “See?” said her voice from the other side of the door. “It’s just that easy.” “There’s something wrong with you,” he shouted. The vomit slid out of him softly into the toilet. When it was over, he rubbed soap on his finger and brushed his tongue. It tasted both awful—blackened chicken—and better. Carter stopped in the doorway to the living room. In the vast cathedral of windows that led up to the log ceiling, the mountains slept on—contented giants, their faces slashed with ice and moonlight. Katrina sat on the sofa, her feet stuck in a bowl of water. Neil held up a mask. It was leather of some kind, with two round eyeholes and a circular trim of feathery white fur. The mouth, however, gave it all its sadness—curved downward with the sucked-in look that old people have when they’ve lost their teeth. “It’s Yupik,” said Neil. “Old school. Dad got it from a Native buddy.” He knelt, actually knelt, at her feet. “Here,” he said. “You take it.” Carter willed himself not to charge into the room. Was this weakness? Or strength? Or some cockroach longing to see how far Katrina would go when she thought he wasn’t there to see? “I’m fucking married,” she said. “I’m fucking happy.” Neil stared up at her, his expression softening until it looked strange, molded, as if smeared across his skin. “It’s a son-of-a-bitch world,” he said, in a quiet voice, a broken voice. “And nobody gets out alive.” She shook her head. “Your dad was sick. He didn’t mean it.” “I think about that night,” said Neil. “That’s what he said, in his toast. Remember?” He picked up the mask from the sofa, tucked it under his arm. “You could have stayed to help me clean up.” Neil was crying by now. Carter didn’t exactly want her to comfort him. Then again, he didn’t expect her to do what she did next. Which was to stare past him, out the window, her face a blank, as if Neil no longer existed. And she were far, far away. Carter stood there, so very aware that he should not move. He had never seen her afraid before. If this was fear as she knew it—or something more terrible. He gave himself a minute. Then another. Though perhaps it was his stillness that caused Katrina to finally glance over. “Carter?” she said. “Buddy!” said Neil, his voice snapping back to jovial. “Your wife has blisters. The ice skates. We made her an oatmeal bath.” His wife, the woman he had married in less time than it took to learn to drive or recover from mono as a teenager, looked down at the carpet so as not to meet his eyes. “You don’t have to go,” said Neil. “Unless you want to.” “Not without our gift,” said Carter. He walked over to the mastodon, slowly, and yanked on the closest tusk. It didn’t move. It was soldered on, perhaps with bronze. “Carter!” said Katrina. “Stop.” “Buddy,” said Neil. “If you want a tusk, take one.” He flung open a door beside the bar. There was a long walk-in closet behind it, piled high with ivory. “What’s mine is yours,” said Neil. “Take any one you like.” “Carter?” said Katrina. “Most are mammoths,” said Neil. “Bigger. Easier to find.” He gestured to a tusk at the back—deeply curved and thick as a human thigh. Carter picked it up. It was lighter than expected. Slick with polish. He dragged it across the carpet. Stopping only at the mastodon. There was no way around it, not alone. He waited. Then waited a little longer—not looking back, even when Katrina finally grabbed the other end of their wedding present and lifted it up. They cleared the first tusk. Then the second. Gracefully. As if they had planned their steps. Was this marriage, he wondered, how well the worst in you worked with the worst in the other person? Or was it something else? He and Katrina had years to find out, a lifetime, once they staggered home through the snow together. There was no stopping for boots, no time to grab coats. Even as Neil called out from the doorway that they could take another tusk, a better one. They could have as many as they wanted. The glaciers were melting, buddy, bones and ivory surfacing. It was almost a little too easy. Everything was right there, lying on the ice. Exposed. Ready for the taking. You didn’t need a shovel. You didn’t need a pickaxe. You didn’t even need to dig.

        "story": "The first time she flies home for the holidays, Iris makes two friends. She is seated between a married couple, because the woman prefers the window and the man prefers the aisle, and they are the kind of people, she discovers quickly, with strong preferences. In general, Iris is the kind of person with mild preferences—preferences that can be painlessly ceded to someone else’s. When the woman clambers over her to use the bathroom, Iris presses her chin against her neck, closes her eyes, doesn’t mind at all. She is eighteen, living half a country away from her parents. The college she attends is not large and not cheap. It doesn’t have a communications major or a business major or a football team. Her parents agree—and they agree on so little—that this is not their idea of an education. While Iris is peeling back the foil on the various components of her dinner—lasagna, green beans, half a dozen mandarin orange segments swimming in liquid—the woman returns and announces she’s pregnant. She reaches across Iris’s lap, her sleeve dangling perilously close to an uncovered dish of chocolate mousse, and waves a plastic stick in front of her husband. “The plus sign!” she says. “Fuck yeah!” he says. He covers her hand with his hand, so that they’re both holding the stick. Eventually, he lets go and she leans back in her seat. She beams blankly at the postcard-size screen in front of her, where a plane is making slow progress across a map. “Congratulations,” Iris says politely, sawing the green beans in half with a plastic knife. The husband and wife leave their aluminum-wrapped meals untouched. The husband has brought them both burritos from a famous restaurant in the city they have just departed. Iris has seen pictures of the burritos, because no one goes to the restaurant without taking pictures. In real life, they aren’t especially impressive—overstuffed and milky with sour cream. Black-bean juice dribbles down the wife’s hand. They tell her they’ve been trying for months. They tell her they like ancient names. “Theodora.” “Cicero.” They offer her guacamole. “Are you sure you don’t want to sit together?” Iris chews a tortilla chip as quietly as possible. She wonders if the crunching is really as loud as it sounds in her head. “Honey,” the wife says, “you’re part of our moment.” “Marcus,” the husband says, wiping salsa from the edge of his mouth. “Or just Aurelius.” Iris’s mother is waiting at the airport. She’s wearing an elegant coat and boots with flower-stem heels, because she disapproves of people who travel in pajamas. The husband and wife tell Iris not to leave without saying goodbye, but she disappears while they’re waiting at baggage claim. She looks back once, while her mother walks ahead, the wheels of Iris’s suitcase clicking in time with her shoes, and she is surprised, seeing them standing together, that the woman is taller than the man. His arm is wrapped around her waist and she leans into him, her head resting gently on the top of his. In the car, Iris tells her mother about the couple. She does not call them “my friends,” and this feels like losing something—like removing a pebble from her shoe, and missing the discomfort. To put the pebble back in would be crazy. She mentions the baby just as a plane passes overhead, so close she can make out the wheels. “What?” her mother says over the roaring. Iris repeats herself. “They should never have told you that.” The car reaches the top of the ramp onto the highway. The traffic passes them in loud whooshes, and it seems impossible to Iris that they will be able to merge into the stream. “They shouldn’t tell anyone for at least three months. That baby”—her mother says this in the voice she reserves for words she does not trust: the newspaper, the forecast, your father—“could be gone tomorrow.” The car nears the end of the acceleration lane, and for a moment it seems they will have nowhere left to go. Then, suddenly—Iris can’t say how—they are part of the stream. In the mirror, another car has appeared at the top of the ramp, and then it too has slipped into the anonymous rush. They speed past unchanging scenery, cement and spindly trees and a blue tarp in the wind, and Iris feels certain that her mother’s words have killed the baby. The car changes lanes. Tomorrow the wife will wake up with a feeling she can’t describe, and the husband will tell her it’s nothing, it’s good, it’s all good, and Iris, of course, will never see them again. When Iris is about to graduate from college, she dates a virgin. Exams are over, and no one has anything left to do except go to parties and throw things away. On the sidewalks, there are lamps without lampshades and posters without frames. Iris pushes her bed out the window because it doesn’t fit through the door in one piece. She and her friends start drinking in the middle of the day. By the afternoon they’re half asleep, surrounded by containers of crusted-over hummus and watermelon rinds—cheap ideas of being festive. The virgin is a boy named Ben. “But he’s rich,” her best friend says while they look at him across someone’s backyard. Charlotte is Iris’s first best friend. They didn’t meet on the first day of school, like some best friends. There was a whole year that Iris endured alone. Charlotte, like Ben, is from New York, where she learned about music and alcohol and deciphering all the signs that money leaves behind. She is the one who told Iris to wear black and gray and white, or else autumnal colors, to drink vinegary brine after shots of vodka, to eat burgers and bagels and bacon—there was nothing, she said, as powerful as eating masculine foods with feminine grace—but to avoid dairy. To wear bras with lace and without flowers, to buy a vibrator, to be grateful, all in all, that she had never been fingered by a teenage boy. The first kiss with Ben is too cinematic. The sprinklers on the lawn behind them come on the moment his lips touch hers. “Don’t look at me like that,” she says. “Like what?” Their shoes are getting sprayed. Her socks are damp. “Like we’re dancing in the moonlight.” He seems a little wounded and this, somehow, is reassuring. “Like this is meant to be.” He closes his eyes for a few seconds and Iris can tell that he is hoping to be someone else—to look, at least, like someone else—by the time he opens them. She resists the urge to touch his hand, or the smooth skin above his hip. When she meets Ben, Iris has had a lot of sex. Some of it is good and some of it is bad, and she has taught herself not to care too much about the difference. In general, not caring requires studiousness. She gives herself assignments: eat peanut butter straight from the jar; steal ChapStick from CVS. She has dropped acid and skipped class and let a boy lick circles around her asshole. There are dozens of tubes of ChapStick in her sock drawer now, and sometimes she takes them out just to look. Iris tries to figure out the reason for Ben’s virginity, but can’t. He is handsome and nice enough. He has accepted most of the other intermediary vices that Iris has learned men like: drinking and smoking and enthusing about oral sex. For a few days, they kiss in places they will one day be nostalgic about. The library, the quad, the roof of the chapel, where no one is supposed to go and everyone does. She wonders why there isn’t a word for the anticipation of nostalgia. “Do you think I’m cheesy?” He shakes his head. The night before graduation, they are naked on Iris’s bare mattress. She has already packed her sheets and thrown away her pillowcases, which were an embarrassing shade of yellow. She closes her eyes when he comes, but when she opens them his face is still twisted in the shape of pain and pleasure mixed together. His mouth is open. In the morning, they put on their gowns, and Iris can’t find her cap. Her mother will be in the crowd, and her father will not, and the only pictures she will be in are the ones taken by other people’s grandparents. “Here, take mine,” Ben says. If she had slept well, if she had eaten properly, if she hadn’t seen his face in its unknowing shape, she tells herself this wouldn’t have made her cry. He puts his arm around her. She looks at the thumbtack holes in the wall, the pieces of tape she gave up trying to peel away, instead of looking at him. When they say goodbye, what they say is, Congratulations. Charlotte teaches her to laugh about it: Iris is pregnant. “A one-night stand with a virgin,” she says. “The movie writes itself.” They’re living together in Charlotte’s childhood bedroom, because they don’t have any plans or any money. Until Iris pays a library fee, she doesn’t even have a diploma. “What’s the moral of the story?” “Abstinence!” Charlotte’s diploma is already on the wall. Beside it, her parents have arranged her school pictures—thirteen years of them—from start to finish. Her bangs grow, her face narrows. Glasses appear and disappear. What Iris likes best is that Charlotte’s smile is never the same. She is tight-lipped, then open-mouthed. One year she fakes it, and the next year she frowns. She reveals her braces, neon rubber bands and clumps of spit. In the very last one, she wears lipstick the color of an open wound. Charlotte has a long-distance boyfriend and a metal device in her uterus, both of which require certain stretches of the imagination. “How can you be sure it’s working?” Iris asks. Her parents leave her favorite foods in the fridge. Her cat scratches the door if she sleeps too late. It’s never been hard, she tells Iris, to trust what’s real. “Oh no,” Charlotte says, because Iris is crying again. “My mom doesn’t know what my favorite foods are.” “You don’t have to laugh about it now.” Charlotte rubs Iris’s back. “We can laugh about it later.” Ben texts her occasionally. Unpunctuated questions, late at night. What’s up. How’s life. She doesn’t respond, because the acceptable answers to these questions have nothing to do with her, or with anyone. Good or Okay or OK. Iris makes herself stop crying, because she isn’t exactly sure what she’s crying about, and she has vowed, in this new phase of life, to be nothing if not precise. “I don’t even know what my favorite foods are.” She pays back Charlotte’s parents for the abortion in installments, even though they insist she doesn’t have to. She applies for a job because the listing says it requires attention to detail. Mostly, she fixes errors in other people’s spreadsheets. When it’s time to order lunch for the office, Iris is the one to specify which condiments must go on the side, and who is allergic to avocados. Nine months after graduation, she texts Ben—Hey—even though she knows she shouldn’t. It would be embarrassing to tell Charlotte she’s been counting the months. Ben doesn’t respond for two days. By then, Iris has convinced herself he never will, which makes it possible—easy—to pretend that the text doesn’t really exist. In May, her mother says she’s cleaning out the house. She wants the drains snaked, the windows clear enough to fool the birds. Iris’s bedroom will be the guest bedroom. The garage will be empty except for the car. “You could come home,” she says, which is not quite an invitation. “You could help.” Iris does not say that it’s been years since there were any guests in the house. She arrives with a half-empty suitcase. It sounds romantic to wear the same dress every day, like something from a movie without much dialogue. The dress is plain. Dark blue—almost black. “You’re so pale,” her mother says. “Don’t wear such dark colors.” The house is the only house Iris has ever lived in. It’s a small box on a street with other small boxes. There are only little differences between them, made to carry the significance of bigger ones. The shrubs are kempt or unkempt, the Christmas lights come down in January or stay up all year, the metal siding is white or gray or faded yellow. Custard, her mother calls it. Her mother believes that elegance is a state of mind. “She has to believe it,” Iris texts Charlotte, who lives in California now. The house is not exactly empty—the furniture is not gone, the walls are not bare—but there is something stale about it, like returning from a long trip, all the usual evidence of wear turned into something ominous: signs of life. Had the tile floor always been this cold? Behind the house, there’s a pool with no water and big, prehistoric-seeming cracks along the bottom. Soon, her mother says, she’s going to fill the pool with cement. When Iris was a kid, she didn’t like the pool as much as she was supposed to. Her hair turned green and her fingertips shriveled. But she was good enough at pretending to enjoy it that now—her feet dangling into nothing, the sun burning the backs of her ears—it’s almost possible to believe she really had. She’s thirsty. Her skin will soon be pink, wounded. It seems, for a moment, like a religious thought: that light is also heat. Iris calls until Charlotte picks up. “Something happened with a man,” she says. Her mother did not talk about romance directly. There had been a pediatrician and a personal-injury lawyer and a handful of men with big ideas. She never used the word “boyfriend.” She had sworn never to reveal their ideas. “She said that?” It’s barely noon in Los Angeles, but Charlotte is already in a crowd. There are restaurant sounds in the background. The kind of brunch that comes with cocktails. “Of course not.” Charlotte knows all the right restaurants. She’s there to meet people who are there to meet famous people. It’s gauche, she says, to go straight for the top. Iris never says “gauche,” because she always forgets how it’s pronounced. “How can you tell?” “The messier her love life, the cleaner her house.” “You’re being very fatalistic,” Charlotte says, sipping something loudly. Iris lowers herself into the pool. The deep end, but only six or seven feet. Someone says Charlotte’s name, cajoling her. Then several people are saying her name, and she’s laughing. She has to go. When Iris hangs up, the phone is covered in sweat. In the middle of the bright white pool, the sun is blinding. There are no leaves on the bottom, no dirt, no mold, no ghostly stains where rain has been. The cracks, when she looks closely, have been scrubbed clean. Her mother calls from the house, and for a moment Iris feels like a child, hiding. She calls again and a dog barks somewhere in response. The pool is too bright and hot for hiding. In the evening, they eat a well-balanced meal. Something green and something brown and chicken. Iris’s nose is already peeling. She considers the things she might reveal to her mother. The roommate who sold cocaine and cast spells; the astrologer who forecast marriage, or usury; the boy who stood above her bed, his eyes closed, still dreaming, and peed all over her sheets. She considers what sort of pro her mother is. Choice, life. The options almost make her laugh. Instead she says, “Are you still dating the entrepreneur?” Her mother slides a garnish to the edge of her plate. A cherry tomato—for color. “No, he didn’t have his act together.” Years ago, she explains, the man had donated his sperm. Back when they gave you cash and genetic testing didn’t exist. He’d moved around a lot. The sperm ended up in many different states. When he eventually settled down, he had a few wives and one daughter. “They all lived in the same town,” Iris’s mother says. “He thought, if anything, that his world was getting too small.” By the time she started dating him, the man was online; everyone was. “And the kids just kept coming out of the woodwork.” She eats the last bite of chicken. The plate is empty, except for the tomato, still whole, which she will throw away. “Then what?” Iris says. “Did he want to know the kids?” Her mother places her knife and fork at four o’clock. “I didn’t want to know.” On the last day of the month, Iris flies back—she doesn’t know, now, what flying home would mean. The woman between her and the window has a cheery ponytail and a brightly colored backpack. She could be a little older than Iris or a little younger. She starts to say something the moment Iris sits down. Iris puts her headphones on and smiles blankly. She tells herself she will keep her eyes closed for the entire flight, because this is a test that is both extreme and achievable. She sleeps on and off, and when she is awake, the image that comes to her, accusing her from the back of her eyelids, is of her mother on her hands and knees, scouring the bottom of the pool. Iris lives in a room the size of her mattress, in an apartment that belongs to a married couple. She keeps her clothes in a closet in the living room, or lets them pile up on the bed, a stack of unironed dresses like a body beside her. The married couple is in a relationship with another married couple, who live down the street. “You can ask any questions about how it works,” one of the wives says. “You probably have a lot of questions,” the other wife says. They look at her expectantly, which makes Iris’s mind go blank. She shrugs. Sometimes the couples all assemble in the kitchen. They make elaborate dishes that involve a lot of waiting—slow-cooked meats, twice-risen loaves—or else require speed and perfect timing. Slabs of tuna still pink in the center, chocolate cake that’s half liquid inside. “Who are they trying to impress?” Iris asks Charlotte, who is still on the other side of the country, whose friends, by now, are all semi-famous. Maybe Charlotte is semi-famous, too. “I love chocolate lava cake.” “Californians don’t eat dessert.” “Maybe they’re just impressing themselves.” The couples always invite Iris for dinner and mostly she declines, even though she doesn’t have anywhere else to be. On those nights, she buys a liter of seltzer and a bag of sunflower seeds from the bodega on the corner. She walks around the city, sucking the salt off the seeds one by one, imagining the decadence of the kitchen. Oven heat, garlic air, sweat and butter, someone’s husband with someone else’s wife. She cracks the seeds with her teeth and spits. By the time Iris returns, the dishes are piled in the sink, the couples drunk. They say they’re happy to see her, which she doesn’t really believe. The dark wine, the melted candles, the runny chocolate. She slinks away to her room. On New Year’s Eve, Charlotte comes home to see her parents. Iris imagines spending the night at their house. A dumb movie, champagne in coffee mugs, the school pictures smiling at them from the wall. Instead, Charlotte invites herself over for dinner. She wants to know everything about the couples. Who sleeps in which bed, who does the dishes, who argues, who touches whose shoulder, cheek, ass. These are not things Iris has wondered about, but she is embarrassed, suddenly, not to have the answers, her own life made small and incurious in the face of Charlotte’s questions. “Of course,” the wife down the hall says. “The more the merrier.” All afternoon, the couples prepare. Iris chops cilantro and watches. They start drinking early, the glasses put down and picked up without looking, the rims smudged with everyone’s lips. Soon they’re snapping at each other. The garlic should be crushed not chopped. The oranges should be blood not navel. The oil pops and sprays and burns someone’s wrist. Iris ranks the spouses in order of attractiveness. Or unattractiveness; their faces are too shiny. Then she guesses how Charlotte would rank them. When the door buzzes, the couples glare at each other. “Who is that?” one husband accuses the other. “It’s me,” Iris says. “I mean, it’s my friend.” They remember. They smooth their aprons. (When, Iris wonders, is the right age to buy an apron?) Someone turns off the oven fan, and it’s quieter than it’s been all day. The oil crackles benignly. Charlotte is wearing the perfect black dress. Both wives confirm this. They forbid her from helping, and bring her wine in a glass that is not a jar. “So,” Charlotte says, the glass stem held delicately between her fingers, “how did you all meet?” For a moment, the couples survey the girls from the other side of the counter. Iris resumes chopping, the rhythmic sound of metal on wood filling the silence before their answer arrives. The week after Charlotte has sex with the married couples—she is already across the country, sending pictures of grapefruit from her backyard—Iris falls asleep on the train and wakes up in a neighborhood where old rich people live. All the apartment buildings have names and all the dogs have haircuts. On a street with a wide median, she stares at the map on her phone and swivels back and forth. The blue dot on the screen bobs uncertainly. Iris walks with no particular goal in mind, crossing to the other side of the street whenever she reaches a red light, so that she never really stops moving, crisscrossing all the way down the city. Iris is imagining the very end of the journey—if she is gone long enough, if her feet hurt enough, if the light above her door is glowing warmly, if her mind is blank with exhaustion, surely it will feel like coming home—when she is stopped short on a corner by the sight of Ben in a suit. He is standing on the other side of a restaurant window. The restaurant is crowded with people in gray suits and dark dresses, and there’s an old woman leaning against him, clutching him. He doesn’t see Iris right away, and when he does—his eyes wider, his face softer—what she feels most of all is guilt. He will wonder how long she’s been standing there. He will wonder if his hair is right, his tie straight. He will wonder if it’s ever really possible to be unwatched. “Sorry,” she says, but there is a window between them. When Ben raises his hand to wave, the woman gripping his suit jacket looks up. She isn’t as old as Iris thought, but her back is hunched and her skin is loose. Without breaking Iris’s gaze, she says something to Ben, releases his jacket, stands a little straighter. He hesitates, and she says it again. A command. For a few seconds, he disappears into the crowd of dark clothes, and then the door to the restaurant opens and he’s standing in front of Iris. “So.” The walk sign above him turns from white to orange. One last car speeds through the intersection. “Someone died,” she says. He nods. His grandmother. “A few more days and she would have been one hundred.” “I admire that.” “Admire what?” “Like, not bothering to reach the milestone.” Ben laughs and she feels her body relax. “You’ll have to come inside,” Ben says. “She insists.” She is his aunt. They sit down at one of the empty tables, with an untouched bread basket and someone else’s purse. “If you live long enough,” she tells Iris, “everyone thinks your mother is your sister.” Ben hovers behind his aunt’s chair, but she waves him away. “Some drinks,” she says, and he disappears in the direction of the bar. The aunt looks at Iris intently. Her eyes are dark, her eyebrows gone. She kneads a pink packet of sugar, or fake sugar, between her thumb and index finger. “He’s a good boy.” Iris nods. “Probably not a great boy.” A few minutes go by, and Ben doesn’t come back from the bar. They wait in silence, or maybe Iris only thinks they’re waiting. Maybe he stopped to talk to his great-uncle or his great-great-uncle or maybe he decided to escape. She doesn’t hold it against him. “When old people die, they only show you the young pictures,” the aunt says, gesturing around the room. It’s true. There are black-and-white photographs taped to poster boards all over the restaurant. It reminds Iris of a science fair. The woman in the photographs has dark hair and pretty sundresses. She’s lying on a beach, leaning out a window, holding a baby to her chest. “They’re beautiful pictures,” Iris says. “I didn’t even know her then.” The aunt tilts the sugar back and forth. “Our biggest fight was about my wedding dress.” Iris looks at her sympathetically, and she laughs. “No, no. Why is fighting always bad?” The aunt tells Iris that her wedding dress had long sleeves and a high neck. From the front, it was old-fashioned, even a little bit ugly. But the back was wide open, all the way down to her waist. Every inch of skin exposed. Her mother hated it. “But it was my consolation prize.” Outside, the sky is getting dark. Their reflections begin to appear in the window. “My back looked good. A dancer’s posture.” “Consolation for what?” The aunt frowns at herself in the glass. “The church was historic,” she says, as if she hasn’t heard Iris. “In one of those towns where everyone’s ancestors came on the Mayflower.” She stood at the back of the church and watched all the faces turn toward her. A dramatic pause, so that she could hear the rustling and breathing and throat clearing, and then the organs came to life all at once. She glided down the aisle. In front of her, the faces smiled and nodded, wiped tears or pretended to wipe tears, and behind her, gradually, one row after another, there was a wave of gasps. “All that skin.” The aunt laughs again. “Back then, it was a shock.” For a few seconds, Iris thinks the laughing will become uncontrollable. The sugar is leaking through the pink paper. Her body is a trembling bird. And then, suddenly, it’s still. When they have been quiet for a while, Iris says it again: “Consolation for what?” The aunt dusts the sugar off her hands. “Oh, you know.” She straightens up and looks Iris in the face. “The husband, the babies. All that.” Ben appears behind the aunt, clutching three wineglasses in an awkward bouquet. She twists around to look at him. The crenellations of her spine press through the silk dress. Beneath her thinning hair, Iris can see pink scalp. “I was married for fifty years,” she says, staring up at him. “Fifty on the dot.” Ben smiles kindly, and Iris can’t tell if the aunt smiles back. The windows are nearly opaque now. She has to focus to see the shapes on the other side—the people walking through her reflection. Iris stands up abruptly, and the glasses in Ben’s hands clink. “It’s a long walk home.” “Oh,” he says, but he doesn’t really look surprised. “Okay.” The aunt turns around. Her face is calm, her hands folded neatly in her lap. “Don’t spill, Benjamin.” He puts the wine down carefully. She bends over in her chair, her chin nearly touching the tablecloth, and blows. The sugar scatters. Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. is an editor at The New Yorker.

        "story": "The old window gave a grand view of Yellow Tree, trunk to branch. They called it Yellow Tree even though the ginkgo was yellow for only about a week each year, its fan-shaped leaves rustling to the ground at the first suggestion of a breeze. Annie and Edward held the baby to the window and said, “See? Yellow!” But she was too small to say “yellow” in response. She just looked and watched and touched the glass. They wiped her fingerprints from the window and kissed the fingers that made the prints. Then the leaves fell, and the scenery changed. Some views show less than half of what needs seeing. When the rent became unpayable, they went in search of a more affordable living situation. What’s your living situation? Annie turned the phrase over in her mind, the situation of their life. They had not saved nearly enough for a broker’s fee, let alone a security deposit. “It looks smaller than it really is,” Edward said, leading Annie around the new apartment. An uneven, dimly lit square, four walls and a slanted floor. “Give it some time, it might grow on you!” “You mean it might literally grow?” Annie asked. At the new apartment, there were no views of Yellow Tree. The introverted windows were gated and clasped and huddled around a central shaft that Edward dubbed Pigeon Tunnel. Edward and Annie liked inventing proper nouns for their world. Yellow Tree, Pigeon Tunnel, Closet Mystery. Closet Mystery was Annie’s term for the mystery of their single, overstuffed closet. Upon opening, what would catapult forth? It was a bona fide enigma. Edward and Annie picked a proper noun for their baby, too. Her noun was Rose. Annie strapped Rose to her chest while she unpacked, stuffing diapers and deconstructed boxes into Closet Mystery, keeping an arm around her, holding tight, in case the fabric of the bindle happened to unfurl like a scarf in a gust of wind, loosing the baby onto the ground. “Careful,” she said to no one but herself. Someday, Edward said, they would have a bit of outdoors all to themselves. A square of grass for playtime, a pot for planting herbs. They had said that at their last apartment, too, and at the apartment before that, and they continued to say it even still, though perhaps with less conviction. They were cramped, Edward said, but in a way that felt familiar and warm, no? Yes, Annie agreed. Secretly, she felt that their lack of space probably signaled her lack of promise, a final judgment on her poor priorities and half-hewn choices. But it was a judgment that, in her deepest heart, had grown commonplace and comfortable, only jabbing its elbow of discontent at moments that found her particularly low. They were lucky in so many ways. They were healthy and happy and fine. They had spent every penny saved on moving in and moving out, even the coins from under the sink. Now there was a new sink, and an empty jar for fresh, shiny coins. The building was closer to Edward’s work, which offered day care. When Annie’s unpaid maternity leave ended, she took the bus to her office, and met Stephanie on the steps outside. Stephanie had covered Annie’s clients while she was away. “The prodigal mother returns!” Stephanie said. “Where’s my marching band?” Annie asked. “Let’s have lunch today,” Stephanie said. “I see a bagel in my future.” “Hey, did they move the copy machine?” Annie asked. “No, they moved your desk.” They ate BLTs with bags of chips, and talked about the reshuffling of the sales team; the new, luxe chairs in the conference room; the water fountain that was still out of order. Annie was looking for an update on her clients, some distress call that signaled she was still needed. “What can I say?” Stephanie said. “You missed nothing.” “Come over for dinner one night, why don’t you?” Annie said. “Oh no, no,” Stephanie said. “I don’t want to get in the way.” “Get in the way. We need to assemble our table. You can be the excuse.” Annie came home and told Edward they needed to buy a table. They put it on the credit card. Annie cut cloth napkins from old fabric, laid out the glasses, the forks, the recently unpacked dishes from her grandmother, each plate painted with a small, gold animal. “I brought wine!” Stephanie said, shoving through the front door and shaking Edward’s hand. “Oh, and who on earth are you?” she asked Rose. Rose responded by handing Stephanie a toy. Annie’s first instinct was to explain the size of their new home. The neighborhood, his office, the day care, what a steal! And then she would nudge Edward to apologize for the lack of space, so cramped, but the good kind of cramped, the amicable kind, the colorful balls and bags and dolls on the floor. But it was Stephanie who spoke first. She said, “Should we eat outside? It’s such a beautiful night.” She opened the door that normally led to their closet, and revealed a terrace, decorated with strings of twinkling lights. Knotted vines gathered around the edges, forking and blooming and racing up the sides of the apartment. The terrace was news to Annie, and also news to Edward. Had they simply overlooked it this whole time? No, it wasn’t possible. “What?” Annie said under her breath. She settled Rose against her hip and peered out onto this terrace (her terrace?), which was equipped with a table and four chairs, a grill, and the kind of sturdy umbrella one could shove open on a sunny afternoon. Everything looked glossy and expensive, as if just purchased, as if just invented. She felt like she had found a missing pair of glasses sitting on top of her head. “Closet Mystery indeed,” Edward said, coming up behind her. “Real Estate Mystery,” Annie whispered. They looked at each other and walked through the terrace door at the same moment. (That’s how big the door! That’s how large the terrace!) They were unharmed, unchanged, and caught in the embrace of a warm autumn evening. Stephanie was admiring a view that did not match the position of the apartment. There was no sight of Pigeon Tunnel, not anywhere. Straight ahead, they could see the remnants of a sunset, even though their side of the building faced east. Stephanie did not seem to notice the faulty geography. “Shit, what a great space,” she said. “Imagine the look on my face when we found it!” Annie said, bringing forth the wine. They sat on the terrace for hours, refilling their glasses and plates. In fact, the longer they stayed on the terrace, the more solid it felt underfoot. Edward let Rose fall asleep in his lap, and kept her there for fear of waking her when standing. There was a sharp tension, followed by a sense of overwhelming calm. The two emotions alternated for Annie until both expired and were replaced with the achy, snoozy joy of a long day spent at the beach, or a morning spent running around a playground. It was an outdoor kind of joy. She could certainly move her arms and legs, but she chose not to. They were weighed down and happy. Oh, and the way the breeze felt on her forehead, the way it brought a soft campfire smell up and over her face. At the end of the night, Stephanie helped them carry the dishes and utensils to the kitchen, and they showed her down to the street. “What fun. Especially this girlie,” Stephanie said, tugging at Rose’s foot. “Thanks for making the trip,” Edward said. “Next time, you come to me!” “Of course we will,” Annie said, wrapping Stephanie in a hug. She couldn’t wait to have the terrace all to herself, alone with Edward, with Rose, her family. She thought maybe they would sleep outside that night—how wild! Just to prove it was real. When they climbed the stairs back up to their apartment, the terrace was gone. Annie opened the closet door, and closed it, over and over, hoping for the kind of outcome that had already lodged itself beyond reach. “Maybe it only appears when we entertain guests,” Annie said. “Or maybe it was just this one magic time!” Edward said, throwing his jeans into a ball on the floor, next to the crib, next to the stove, next to the table, for which they really did not have enough space, neither in the apartment nor on the credit card. “Tonight was super,” he said. “Tonight we had a terrace. We’ll talk about it forever.” “Still,” Annie said into the pillow. “Still,” Edward agreed. Edward and Annie never went to Stephanie’s home for dinner, because she did not invite them. Also because, more than wanting the return of Stephanie, who was nice enough, they wanted the return of the terrace, which was more than nice. It was perfect. They invited over Edward’s parents, their old neighbors, their best friends from college. They had a nice time catching up with all the people in their lives, introducing them to Rose, hearing their current stories. But there was no terrace, not with Jim and Joanne, not with the O’Neills, and not with Liza and Sunny. For each visit, Annie would set the table in just the same arrangement, with a mug of pollen-shedding flowers, and the collection of gold animal plates, and then she would try to reveal the terrace. Instead of releasing the glow from a setting sun, the closet would release a stray bag of diapers. “Maybe you have to turn the knob a certain way,” Annie said, trying her hand at terrace sorcery. “Maybe it’s all in the wrist.” The proper noun for this period of time was, as Edward put it, Sadness Home. Annie wandered the apartment in a state of perpetual frustration, Rose hanging from her breast, the dishes gathering in the sink. She even missed a couple days of work. She dug through the mess of Closet Mystery and pressed her hands against the back wall, looking for a trapdoor or secret hinge. She woke up early to feed Rose, and paced the kitchen. What if the terrace was tied to cycles of the moon? What if the apartment was haunted by the terrace? What if there’s only a terrace when Stephanie is here? she wondered. She was right, of course. When Stephanie returned for a Sunday brunch, the terrace returned, too. It was resplendent in the afternoon sun, the wooden slats dappled with light and strewn with acorns, gold and orange leaves underfoot. “You guys need a good sweep, huh?” Stephanie teased, kicking some leaves through the bars of the terrace, and watching them float down to the street. They spent the whole afternoon outside, plying Stephanie with drinks and snacks, and snacks and cheese, and then a giant mug of steaming cider. “I’m never leaving,” Stephanie said, her overlarge sunglasses lolling down the bridge of her nose. “Fine by me!” Annie said. She spread a blanket on the terrace floor and sat with Rose in her lap, the lip of the umbrella creating a perfect wedge of shade. They played with the plush pig, and Rose chewed on the corners of a book made from crinkly fabric. Edward grilled hot dogs and tightened the screws on the terrace chairs, entertaining Stephanie with stories about things that had never happened. Vacations they had not taken, friends they’d never had, the fortune they’d inherited from Annie’s grandmother, when really all they had inherited was her set of gold animal plates. “Just like that time when you and Edward were in Italy!” Stephanie said one day at the office, and Annie had to remind herself: they had never been to Italy. Annie and Edward called these Terrace Stories, because when you are in a place that does not really exist, you can populate it with as many fables and legends as you like. “I will never lie to you on solid ground,” Edward said, and Annie knew it was true. Yellow Tree, Pigeon Tunnel, Terrace Story. Every weekend, Annie invited Stephanie for a visit. “Maybe I can pop by for a minute,” Stephanie would say, but it was never just a minute. They played Scrabble and chess, and they knit scarves and read books in the sun. They had picnic lunches and picnic dinners, and a picnic breakfast at dawn. Annie purchased some flowers and flower pots and potting soil, for the perimeter of the terrace. She put it all on the credit card. Stephanie helped her nestle the mums in mounds of dirt. “We can’t keep forcing her to come over here,” Edward said under his breath. “Who’s forcing?” Annie whispered. “I barely need to suggest it. She practically invites herself.” “But what’s in it for her?” Edward asked. “I mean, besides the terrace.” “Rosie, you’re so stinky!” Stephanie said on the other side of the umbrella, holding the baby up in the air, too high, much too high, too near the edge. “Careful, careful, careful,” Annie shouted, and ran to take Rose and change her. “Oh, boo-hoo,” Stephanie mock cried. But for a moment, Annie noticed real sadness along the edges of Stephanie’s voice, and tried to locate what kind of space those edges indicated, how that space wanted to fill itself. If there was a yearning, Annie could not tell what the yearning was for. She looked back at Stephanie, and Stephanie met her gaze, holding Annie’s attention for a moment too long. Really, who was this stranger in her home? Stephanie walked to the terrace door and blocked the entrance, shouted, “Hey Eddie, you got another beer for me?” They stayed up playing charades and laughed so hard they thought the terrace would fall straight down through the center of the earth. The toilet was clogged again, and this time they would have to call a plumber, a real plumber, not simply a friend who owed a favor. But for the time being, just once, Edward turned his back to the ladies and peed off the edge of the terrace. They howled with laughter. “Annie’s going to start stocking up on diapers for you, Eddie!” Stephanie roared, leaning too far back in her chair. Annie and Edward fell asleep without cleaning up the terrace, but the terrace cleaned itself. Stephanie came over on a rainy Saturday, and it sparkled in the drizzle, no beer bottles or napkins, no trash to be found. The mums were growing large and lush. At the office, Annie’s supervisor moved her desk to a different floor, and redistributed some of her clients to Stephanie, just for convenience. She’s more up-to-date on everything, the email said. Be the team player we all know and adore! “Do your co-workers adore you?” Annie asked Edward. Edward asked, “Hey now, is this a Terrace Story?” “I was thinking maybe Stephanie could bring a friend when she comes over this weekend. What do you think?” Annie asked, shoving a tower of toilet paper into the closet. “Great idea. I adore it.” Annie texted Stephanie, making the invite. Bring a friend? Or maybe more than a friend, she added, dot dot dot. Stephanie came by herself, carrying a board game. The dice and tiny plastic parts tumbled around the box with a rattle, the type of messy noise that lets everyone know: important pieces are missing. “Just you?” Annie asked. “Just me,” Stephanie said, and went to sit next to Edward. One night, Annie pulled the record player out onto the terrace, stringing its cords back through the apartment. The three of them danced and took turns waltzing with Rose, holding her up and wiggling her legs, but never throwing her in the air, not like this, not so high, not outside. When they were completely out of breath and tired of being on their feet, Edward told a Terrace Story. Later on, it would be the only one that Annie would remember from start to finish. It was about a date that they had never had, with a limousine they had never hired, and a cheesy bouquet of roses they had never purchased. And that’s how they came up with the name Rose, in the context of this Terrace Story. In the context of real life, Rose was Annie’s grandmother’s name. Annie did not appreciate this small erasure. “This restaurant,” Edward said, “it’s the kind of place with private dining, where you get to sit in your own room, a room with just one table and two chairs. And the waiters knock on the private door before bringing the food, the drinks, the bill. They even knock before entering to ask, Would you like to have dessert?” “But how many times do they knock?” Stephanie asked. “Is it a rat-tat-tat?” “No,” Edward said. “It’s more of a rat-a-tat-a-tat-tat.” “Rata-matata-matata?” Stephanie asked. “Shave and a haircut, plus two bits.” Annie twitched. It was all so playful. It was an inside joke, and she was on the outside. The Terrace Stories were meant for Edward and Annie, not for Edward and Stephanie, but here they were, tapping their secret codes on the terrace rail. And there was the look on Stephanie’s face, like she knew the whole story by heart. Why a private room, Annie thought, unless you don’t want to be seen? “That was a real date,” Annie said. “A real date you went on with someone else.” They were throwing off their clothing and throwing off their shoes. It was late. Stephanie was gone, and so was the terrace. “What are you talking about?” Edward said. “That wasn’t a Terrace Story—it was a real story.” “That’s absurd.” “Don’t lie. I mean, the whole bit with the knocking!” “Annie, come here. Stop now. Come here. It wasn’t real.” They lay as far apart in the bed as possible, which of course was not very far. Then Edward’s heel wedged itself between Annie’s ankles, and soon they were hugging, and soon everything was on its way to better. Annie woke up to feed Rose, and she checked the credit card statements. She looked for a restaurant charge. She looked for a limousine, or a place in their neighborhood with private dining rooms. There wasn’t anything logical about how she felt, and yet, can the woman who visits an imaginary terrace really claim logic for herself? Even if the story about the date wasn’t real, Edward had made it real by telling it, and now the false story was part of their living situation, like a fresh growth on the side of a plant, like the terrace. Edward stumbled out of bed and found Annie in the chair, nursing Rose. “Maybe it was a real date I wanted to go on, someday,” he said. “With you.” Stephanie joined them for Thanksgiving. The weather had stayed warm, and so of course they ate outside. Annie had tried to purchase a turkey, but the credit card was declined. She had to carry the turkey all the way back through the store to the last aisle. Edward burst into action, stirring and mashing, declaring their dinner the Meal of Sides. They feasted on supplementary dishes, which, Stephanie insisted, were the best part anyway. “I love a good stuffing!” she said to Edward, throwing broken bread crusts in the pan. Rose stuck her fingers in the potatoes and wore a pumpkin onesie that Annie had picked out special. And New Year’s Eve, with the weather still just right for sweaters, they gathered on the terrace with mugs of bad champagne. Thanks to the altered view, their party could see large, blossoming willows of fireworks in the distance. These were the ones that Annie remembered from her childhood, her grandmother taking her to the local park to see the flowering gowns of twinkling white lights, opening, falling, and disappearing through the dark. “If you celebrate the New Year on an imaginary terrace,” Edward whispered to Annie, “does it really happen?” “It all really happens,” Annie said, smiling up at Edward. When the minutes turned to seconds, and the seconds concluded their downward march, Edward turned to Stephanie and kissed her on the cheek, perhaps so she would not feel left in the cold. Annie took Rose up in her arms and kissed her all over her face, planted a raspberry on her stomach. Then Stephanie reached for Rose, as a kindness, so that Edward could move for Annie’s lips, which he did, but once again, Stephanie brought Rose much too close to the edge of the terrace, much too close for Annie to bear, and she grabbed Rose back from Stephanie without waiting for Edward’s embrace. The physicality of the moment passed quickly, but it lingered from the end of one year into the beginning of the next, Annie and Edward standing only steps apart, the sensation of extra space tucked between the inches. In early winter, they bundled Rose from head to tiny toe and plopped her on the terrace floor. She could now sit up without support, her hands slapping her thighs, mittened and buttoned. “She looks so much like both of you,” Stephanie said, as if making a concession. She was building a snowman at the edge of the terrace, embellishing his face with perfectly ripe vegetables that Annie had planned on cooking into a stew for dinner. “How should I do his eyes, Rosie?” Stephanie laughed. Annie would retrieve the vegetables when Stephanie wasn’t looking, she decided. The cold would keep them usable for dinner, surely. The snow was still fresh. The carrots would need to be washed and peeled, diced, but otherwise, fine. Then Stephanie knocked the bundle of carrots over the edge of the terrace. “Whoops! Man down,” she said. “Should I run and grab them?” “Don’t bother,” Annie said. Where, exactly, would she run? Where would she even end up? On a frigid Monday, Annie had a meeting scheduled with her supervisor. She planned on asking about pursuing additional clients, to make up for the redistributed list. She planned on asking for a raise. Instead, they suggested shifting Annie to a part-time schedule. We can only afford to keep you on for these days, at this rate, her supervisor said. Especially with Stephanie taking most of your clients. You are always welcome to find something else, if this doesn’t meet your needs, and so forth. Annie decided that the job no longer met her needs. “To be honest, you’ve seemed distracted,” the final email said. She packed her plant and pictures and pens in a box, and ran into Stephanie near the elevator bank. “Oh, it’s you,” Annie said. Stephanie was always popping into view, as familiar as any of the furniture in her home. “I just heard,” Stephanie said. “Listen, I’m so sorry. It wasn’t my—” “It’s fine. Are you leaving now?” “Yeah, I was just about to head out.” “You should come over,” Annie said. “Really? Right now?” “Now,” Annie said, holding the doors. Standing in the elevator with Stephanie was the opposite of standing on the terrace. Annie could feel their heat, their silence contained and amplified and spun in circles. She wanted to bang on the walls or smack the emergency button, her eyes welling with an unexpected rage. She wanted one of them to be somewhere else, but felt they were doomed to always be in the same place at the same time. She caught Stephanie staring at her from the other side of the elevator with a rude sort of curiosity, and resisted the urge to swat her away. She needed for Stephanie to come to her home, reach out her hand, to open the closet door, and everything would resolve, her anger sizzling off the sides of the terrace. But hadn’t Annie sometimes felt angry on the terrace, too? Hadn’t she felt something worse than anger? “Can I carry your box?” Stephanie asked. “No,” Annie said. When they arrived at the apartment, Edward was feeding Rose and warming up leftovers for himself. “Oh! I wish you had called first,” he said, motioning to Stephanie. “It’s fine,” Annie said, trying to remain calm. All she wanted to do was relax and feel that lazy kind of joy, the happy weight on her legs and arms. “Let’s go sit outside.” “I don’t know,” Stephanie said, halfway out of her coat. “It’s below freezing.” “Who cares? We have blankets. We’ll drink hot tea!” Annie exclaimed, throwing her box of office goods down near the closet door. “It’s ten degrees outside,” Edward said. He looked at the box, and then at his wife. “Can’t we stay inside?” Stephanie asked. “We can watch a movie. Cozy, cozy.” She shifted her weight from one leg to the other, looking uneasy, and, for the first time, unwelcome. “I don’t know,” Annie said. She felt an outrageous despair rising inside her, that jab of discontent, hitting harder and sharper every time Stephanie opened her mouth to speak. She took Rose up in her arms. “I don’t know, on second thought, maybe you should just leave.” “Annie, if this is about work—” “Stephanie, don’t go,” Edward said. “It’s really fine!” He scrambled toward Stephanie, trying to make sense of the moment, probably terrified that Annie would say something awful to her, Annie figured, something that would reveal the way they had used Stephanie ill, taken advantage, negotiated her friendship for a bit of outdoors. Or worse, perhaps his desire that Stephanie should stay was a genuine one. Perhaps he felt—and this word fell down like an unhitched icicle—a fondness for her. The pain of that noun was more urgent than the other, previous pain, and Annie relented. “No, no, never mind,” she said, shaking her head. “I’m so sorry. I’m not myself. Of course we can stay inside. We can watch a movie.” Stephanie gave a look to Edward and put out her hand, mouthed, It’s fine, gathered her scarf, and walked to the door. Annie tried to picture Stephanie returning home to her own apartment, and realized she could not picture it. She still had not been invited to visit. “See you later, sweet Rosie,” Stephanie said. The nickname burrowed under Annie’s skin, and did not leave. Before Annie was taken to live with her grandmother, she was just Anne. Nouns can change once, and then change forever, all thanks to a small addition. It was not until early March, when snow started melting down the windows, that Annie fully felt the loss of the terrace. Her claustrophobia had gloved itself in flannel and down for winter, but in spring, it had no disguise. With her new free time, she went out for long walks with Rose buckled in the stroller. They rolled through the neighborhood, sampling the occasional discount doughnut and coffee, Rose grabbing at the drops of water that trickled from branches, vocalizing with the birds. Annie tried to avoid crushing the earthworms, but occasionally, one worm was bound to split in two. And then their walk would end, and home again, there were no exits or entrances to safely throw open, no extra air or space to claim. She didn’t feel trapped, or at least that wasn’t the word on her tongue. She felt it had been easier to bear the boundaries of her home before the terrace. She marked the days with Rose’s milestones, which accumulated at an alarming rate: Laugh, Crawl, Food, Wave, Word. These were the new proper nouns in her life, all firsts. She marked them down in a book of firsts, and dreamed about the other nouns to come. Even the ones that weren’t firsts or lasts were exciting. The middle would be just as good, or even the best, like the center slice cut from a square cake. Despite the terrifying, mounting expense of Annie’s unemployment, Edward seemed resigned to the new arrangement, even happy. He encouraged her to take her time, as much time as she wanted—not too much, you know, just the right amount, as long as the right amount was the amount she needed. He never mentioned Stephanie, at least, not until the day she rang their bell. That morning, it was truly spring, and the temperature climbed to what would have been ideal terrace weather. The birds had made their nest on the window ledge in Pigeon Tunnel, and the pigeon eggs did not provoke disgust in Annie, nor tenderness, rather a sort of sustained curiosity. She checked on them every morning. She was checking the eggs when Stephanie arrived. “Can I come in?” Stephanie asked, carrying what looked like a pan of homemade brownies. “Of course,” Annie said. But why of course? Some animal tendency unveiled itself within her, and she bared her teeth. After a moment, she could play it off as a smile, and she did. “Should I take off my shoes?” Stephanie asked. It was an absurd thing to say, after the many months she had spent stomping through their home in heels and boots and flats alike. But perhaps their home had changed. Perhaps Stephanie had changed, too. Annie waved her hands, dismissing the question. “I’m glad you’re here,” she said, and immediately regretted it. Was she glad? She made way for Stephanie, for the brownies. “Stephanie!” Edward said, coming from behind the counter with Rose nestled against his hip. “What a nice surprise.” Annie knew when her husband was surprised. She remembered his face from the first evening of the terrace. This wasn’t surprised. “Let’s go sit outside and talk,” he said, leading Stephanie to the closet door. She took the knob in her hand as if she’d never been away, and with a slight rotation of the wrist, there was the terrace, just as they remembered it. The mums, despite the interceding months, continued to bloom. Annie had forgotten what it felt like to have the door open, the air rushing through their home, the light filtering the color of their floors with a richer hue. “Did you invite her?” Annie asked Edward, once Stephanie was safely outside. “Don’t be cross,” Edward said, shuffling Annie through the door and into the sunlight. He followed closely behind her, carrying Rose. “Please,” he added. They wandered around in silence for some moments, surveying the surroundings, taking in the terrace and its new season. In spring, they learned, the terrace smelled of dew and fresh flowers. Had the trees changed, Annie wondered, and been replaced with more fragrant versions, to best convey the current month? Of course, Stephanie did not know they had been bereft of their terrace, and so their puttering around must have felt bizarre to her at best. “Stephanie, would you like something to drink?” Annie asked. “Oh no, thank you. I won’t be staying long,” she said. She waited until everyone was seated before speaking again. “I wanted to apologize, for intruding on your life, your work. I feel I probably made a complete nuisance of myself.” “Don’t be ridiculous!” Edward said, and Annie watched him, watched her. Was this exchange rehearsed? “I somehow couldn’t help myself. I have trouble,” Stephanie said, looking down, an oblique confession that, nevertheless, seemed honest. “You’re never a nuisance,” Annie said, watching Edward again, and Edward made a motion with his chin, encouraging Annie to continue. “We’ve missed you. Rose has missed you.” Annie took Rose into her lap, as if to cancel the previous statement, laying unequivocal claim to the child. In mere moments, the sun had dried Rose’s wet curls, turned them warm and soft. Annie burrowed her face in Rose’s hair, lingering on the phrase Rose has missed you. There was something crucial here, but the crucial information darted away, refracting and escaping in the pleasant morning light. Stephanie watched Annie with great interest, as if this moment were the only one she had come to witness. “Anyway,” Stephanie said. “That’s all I have to say. I’ve been so grateful for your hospitality.” And then, as if propelled by the terrace, in conjunction with the word hospitality, Annie jolted from her seat. “Stay a little longer,” she said. “I’ll go and plate those delicious brownies you brought.” She set Rose down in Stephanie’s lap, and lifted herself away, barely in control of her limbs, wondering if she had been speaking aloud, or only in her head. Before long, she was in the kitchen. How did I get here? She thought. And where is Rose? She could hear the birdsong and the song of her family in the distance, their familysong, Rose cooing and producing sounds to accompany the planes overhead, her husband’s laugh rising and then falling in its distinctive staccato. “Babe, come back quick!” Edward said. “There’s a flying squirrel!” Annie felt her heart pounding in her chest, a shortness of breath. She dropped the plate on the floor. She somehow knew she would never see the flying squirrel, but did not yet know why it mattered. Edward said, “Quick! You’re missing it!” When Annie turned around, Stephanie’s body was fully blocking the doorway. She had a neutral expression on her face, or maybe it was slightly bemused. She closed the door halfway, the light dimming, a shadow falling on the floor. And then, she took hold of the knob as she had so many times before, only this time, from the outside. Stephanie closed the door shut. The terrace, once again, was gone. If it is ever possible to stop thinking of death, then Annie willed this for herself. In order to proceed, it was necessary to eliminate the threat of death from her thoughts. The exposure, the winters, the heat, the animals, the rain, the snow, the unknown. In order to proceed, Annie needed to make an assumption of life. It was under this assumption that she waited for Edward and Rose. At first, the waiting was easy. Their return felt imminent. She waited with the assumption of life. Of course there were the initial screams and the side-splitting moans, sounds that came from some nameless part of her body. But then, she waited. She observed the eggs of Pigeon Tunnel, ate the pan of brownies, sat on the floor near the closet. With great diligence, she tried to rotate her wrist at just the right angle, pulling the knob toward her and hoping to reveal Edward, smiling on the other side of the door. Or was he Eddie now? Was she Rosie? Then the pigeon eggs were abandoned by their mother. Then they broke open without hatching, a thin skein of yellow rising from the shell of each egg. Then the eggs were snatched, eaten by other pigeons, and so the consideration of death always had a way of returning. Annie moved from her spot next to the closet, and huddled inside the closet itself. Proximity, she thought, will get the job done. Only a few days after that, she could hear their voices beyond the closet wall, or so she believed. Their familysong, pealing like bells just beyond reach. And of course, she could hear them more clearly when the closet was completely closed, so she tucked her knees to her chest and pulled the door shut. She could have listened to them forever, sitting there, her head cushioned against their abandoned sweaters and puffy coats. Of course, she didn’t. Grief is not the door that tucks you in; it’s the door that shuts you out. But Annie allowed herself this moment. The plastic hangers above her head shifting with the weightlessness of wind chimes. The questions hardening and multiplying. What nouns will my daughter learn? What Terrace Stories will she tell? An imagined breeze from somewhere unseen. A proper name for this feeling, on the tip of Annie’s tongue. The rest of the world receding slowly from view.

        "story": "The child is scared. Shrieking. She cannot get down. The child is four, in a whorl of terror. The mother is livid. Screaming. She thinks the child is weak, girly, daunted by life. Log line: The child has egged herself on up the scaffold of her mother’s judgment and is stuck at its apex. They are at a playground, where so much of adult grief is previewed, or so the mother thinks, because some part of her is always elsewhere, exploiting her life for drama. She is certain she will tell this story later and derive pleasure from its horrors—already she understands its horrors. The mother, Mom, Mommy-I-just-love-you-Mommy, thinks she has brain cancer. Blood clots tethered to her veins by little more than fate. A heart defect no one will have known she had until the autopsy. She is afraid to go to sleep because what if she dies before she can prepare her daughter, so that at 6:00 am, refreshed and full of joy, this little turkey-monkey-love-of-my-life will bound into her room only to find out Mommy, wake-up-Mommy, is dead. The mother thinks: It’s not that monsters don’t exist; it’s just that no one’s ever seen one. I could be the first. What if I’m the first? These days, it’s not as hard as it sounds to live like this.  The mother’s name is June, though she was born in July. Always so close to being right. She does communications for an oil company and often hears its name mentioned on the evening news among other evils despoiling the planet. Now and then she considers investing in cryogenics, except what is the point? June often thanks God she will pass before global warming shuts up the deniers for good, but then she realizes there’s still her child to worry about. And her child’s child. If June is lucky, she will not have enough time to bond with her grandchild, because though she has human feelings, she does not want them. She cannot get another pet for fear of having to endure the pain of its loss. She cannot stay married for fear of having to nurse this man into old age and death. She cannot abide the thought of her daughter being unable to defend herself against the future. Her daughter, stuck on the top of this ridiculous ladder, arched like a rainbow that’s just high and narrow enough to make it impossible for her to be rescued, this child who’s now sobbing so hysterically that other children have begun to crowd around and shriek with her, the shrieks of one conducting the others in a chorus of anxiety because a little help here? Just now, before, June was reading about a financier who’d given up on finance to start a carbon-capture company. He was charismatic. Galvanized by the urgency of now. He’d found a way to harness a natural solvent to absorb carbon dioxide when dry and release it at high concentrations when exposed to moist air. A humidity swing, it was called. Was doom certain? When confronted by friends terrorized by the promise of tomorrow, June parried with an optimism that beat them back into the refuge of hope. But on her own, she romanced dread with more ardor than she had for anything else. The child is, perhaps, “highly sensitive.” She absorbs the world’s anguish and makes it her own. June, whose college boyfriend once told her she thumped around like Godzilla, finds this quality sweet and impractical. She says, “Just calm down, baby. You need to calm down. The more hysterical you are, the harder you’re making it.” The ladder is actually shaking. It’s not sturdy at all. The child has her butt in the air, downward dog, which has displaced her center of gravity and made her situation more dire. She has no idea how to use her body. She’s helpless and can only flaunt her helplessness absent trying to solve for it. June looks up, sees her child silhouetted against the sky polluted with pinks and blues and says, “Sweetie, you can do this. Put your hand here and your foot there. Just breathe.” The child’s screaming can now be heard several blocks away as it escalates from fear of failure to the certainty of pain. June’s oil company had, in fact, offered one week’s paid leave to any employee who wanted to embed with the financier’s team and report on its progress. The only way to continue wrecking the planet for profit was also to support its remediation. PR 101. June’s husband had encouraged her to go. “Maybe they could use some communications help,” he’d said. The child, who recycles conscientiously and talks at length and with sorrow about the turtle mouths being jammed with plastic, had asked if she could go, too. This technique of modern storytellers in which ostensibly disparate narratives are dragged into the double helix of creation—it is a way of aggrandizing the petty and globalizing the grotesque. This is what June thinks as she meanders through all the ways fear of the Big Problems maps onto intolerance for her child’s frailty. And yet: the other day, June requested from her library a book about highly sensitive children, thinking, I’m educating myself; I am taking this seriously. Except a serious parent would have bought the book, dog-eared its pages, and referred to it with biblical frequency. There had been, as well, another mass shooting. And another. The news splashed across the front page of the paper, and there was her child, who had just learned to read, sounding out the headline while June scrolled on her phone through videos in which interspecies grooming was a phenomenon to behold. The child does not want to get down. She does not want to quit the effort of impressing her mother, so even as she is sobbing, she is also yelling, “I do not want to give up!” A boy standing below her shouts, “What’s happening to you?” Composure mans the gate, always has. June does not like confrontation. She is shaken when people are angry with her, though, secretly, she loves feeling angry herself. The power of its release. The endorphin rush. But composure mans the gate. It would be unseemly to let loose her fury, which will crash over her child like a tsunami, with equal result. The child. She is gentle and kind and funny and smart. She’d wanted to know what a maaa-sah-ker was. The thing is, the financier’s seed money was running out. The science was promising, the prototypes were promising, but where were his proof points? Now his company petitioned June for donations at least twice a week. She sent $40, which got her a tote emblazoned with the company’s logo, which she uses to store the child’s princess costumes. Costumes June had bought thinking: If I do not make appalling extensions of stereotype forbidden, they will lose their appeal. The child sleeps in one of these costumes every night and often, in photos, can be seen posing with hips at a diagonal and one foot angled away from the other as if intuitively to flatter her figure. Other parents have begun to encroach on the scene. June can feel one on her flank even as she’s focused on her child, whom she is now begging to calm down and descend the ladder, her voice plaintive but pinched and tipping to anger. The child’s hands have begun to tire and her body is wobbling and probably she will fall and break her arm. June does some math. The nearest hospital is only blocks away. The child will miss a few days of school. But she’ll get a pink cast and be happy about that, and as soon as June decides the worst that can happen is still manageable, she’s able to settle the butterflies that have gone wild in her stomach. She loves this child to unreason. After the newspaper episode, June had found the child crying on the couch and asked why. “Is it because of what you read?” She could not believe she’d left the computer screen open. Mass shootings, global famine, rising tides. But the child did not know. “I can’t control my feelings, Mommy.” “Yes you can,” June said, and spent the rest of the afternoon in argument with herself about whether excess feeling is bad or just its expression. The standoff on the ladder appears to climax just as June exhausts her reserve of good parenting. Or exhausts her faith that good parenting can help. She extends her arms in the air. Stands on tippy-toes. But all the same, her child is about to fall. June tries to anticipate where so she can catch her, but the chances are still good the child will mangle her face in the process, whacking it on one of the rungs and plummeting awkwardly and unpredictably, and the more June reckons with these scenarios, the harder her composure works to hold its ground. But it is no use. Finally, in a great roar, fury charges out of June’s mouth like a pack of wild boar, mowing down the gates and raging through the countryside until finding prey in the small child, who is immediately devoured. June yells at her to stop shrieking right now, but it’s not so much what June says as the rage and pitch of her voice as she says it. Her voice is so loud, she can’t hear anything else, until the parent who’d been on her flank steps in and says to the child, “Why don’t you come down now?” with all the tenderness of a fairy godmother. Then this parent issues a set of gentle instructions, and in five seconds the child has returned to the rubber mat, wiping her nose and sniffling. June rushes to hug her, even though the self-slaughter of shame has her bleeding out and ready to die. Weakly, she attempts to explain her behavior to the audience of parents around them. She says she was just trying to snap her child out of it because this technique—almost like a slap to the face—is what usually helps, and then she stops to marvel at the ease with which she is able to fabricate exculpatory context, even as it doesn’t appear to work. “You know your child best,” one parent says. That night they watch Mister Rogers to relieve the day’s unforgivables. But there will be no relief—not for June, who later gets into bed next to her husband and piles on him everything she’s done until the pile gets so high it crowds her out of the bed and into her daughter’s, where she will spend the hours before dawn holding her and thinking: A massacre is when everything you don’t like about yourself wins.

        "story": "Miranda was tall and as dark-haired as they come. I say was and not is and that is inaccurate because she is still around and I really am not. She wasn’t exactly beautiful and as I say that I can hear the men in town hiss. Men, of course, look for different markers. Fine—she was beautiful. Is beautiful. Everybody likes a story with a beautiful woman and this one has two. Miranda had hair like soaked beetles. A big nose, the kind that looks good on a voluptuous woman. She was forty-four the last time I saw her. And Sol was seventy-five. Still had the brick house in Mendham with the oval vinyl pool he meant to turn gunite. He talked about it every year. Got quotes every summer. Then it turned August and he figured life passed so quickly. Anyway, vinyl was soft on the feet. Miranda was married to Luke, a WASP. They had a daughter named Caroline, a name I’ve never understood. He was very handsome, her husband. They had a small but nicely renovated cape with a quarter acre he paid someone to mow. They fell out of love because they were never in love. He liked to get behind her and she liked the stability of a WASP, the sharp edges, clean ears, stick-shift Saab. It ended when Caroline was three. The excitement of having a child had sloughed off. The kid was like a marble countertop with water stains. This precious thing that they still had to worry over long after it had lost its luster. Well, I don’t think that’s true of Luke. I think Luke loved the kid more than he loved himself. But you know most parents really don’t feel that way. They just can’t admit it. It’s the end of the world when they do. Miranda was a whore. I don’t know how else to say it. The way she spoke to men, to all men. It was obscene. Fat men, old men, boys. Like her tongue was a snake. At the fish market in particular there was a black boy. He couldn’t have been more than seventeen. She eyed him and let him eye her. And more. She leaned over the counter when it came time to pay. Sometimes she paid for me. I suppose she knew then how it might come back to her. She leaned over the counter with her tan chest and her low-cut tops. The boy’s name was Malcolm. It said so on his white coat. He didn’t know a thing about fish. After we went shopping we’d go for espresso. There was a place on Adams called Caffè Espresso Italia. Everybody in her group went to Starbucks, or the kind of place that sells day-old croissants in a muggy window. But Miranda understood the importance of good coffee. My treat, she would say, almost every Sunday. Then we’d sit by the window and talk. One of the last times I saw her, she told me the story. —I’m leaving Luke, she said. Her arm jangled with all her silver bracelets as she lifted her cup to drink. —Stai zitta, I said. I didn’t believe her. —No, Zia, e vero. Sometimes she called me Zia. I can’t say it didn’t warm me. —What happened? Why? —He’s a pig, she said. This was insanity. Luke was a mouse. Everything about him you could throw in a laundry basket and forget about until the morning. —Stop it. —He is, Zia. You wouldn’t believe it, some of the things he wants me to do. —What does he want you to do? I asked. Now I was interested. She leaned into my face and whispered. Her breath was hot and wet. I could sense in that moment what it was like to be with her in that way. I heard from some people in the neighborhood she used to go with women in college. But all young people were that way now. Just pubic bones and telephones. What she told me was lewd but by no means vile. Luke wanted to subjugate her in certain ways. He wanted to do it outside on their composite deck, in full view of the neighborhood. But in the middle of the night. While the child slept of course. Anyway he was her husband. —That’s it? I said. —No, she said, exhaling, as though she still smoked cigarettes. I of course did, and she would accompany me outside for them. But I wasn’t one of those smokers who smoked between meals. Those idiots. —What else? —He hates the president. And that’s fine, you know, whatever. But he’s one of these, you know, these bleeding hearts. —Non sapevi? —Of course I knew a little. But no. You know this new time, it brings everything out in people. I nodded. —Zia, I just can’t stand him. I hate him. I hate the way he swallows his food, you know? I laughed. She was so young. At forty-four I had been much older than her. Perhaps I was misremembering. —What about the kid? I said. That is when she began to cry. Not plain tears, but torrential. I was always uncomfortable when women cried. I didn’t know how to be with them. I touched her arm. It was moist. She was like a candle. Her hair smelled like smoke, mine, and perfume, hers. Candy-smelling, cheap-smelling, though probably it was engineered to smell cheap. There was so much I didn’t care to understand anymore. Perhaps that’s why I got sick shortly thereafter. God knows when you’re done learning. —What is it? I said. Through her heaving tears she told me, in quiet, low-class Italian, that she didn’t care about the child the way a mother should. That Caroline was better off with her father than with a mother who felt cheated by the terrific responsibility of a child. She told me that when the child cried nothing tugged in her heart. Not even when she was very sick with the flu, as she had been that winter. Even when the child’s temperature shot up to 106 and Luke called the doctor in the middle of the night, trembling, Miranda said she only bided her time until she could go back to bed. She was in the habit of taking sleeping pills and she was irritated that the effect was wearing off, the head clearing to make way for the fuck of day. That was the phrase she used. I have never spoken like that, although I have certainly thought in scandalous ways. I can’t say I was surprised. I knew what type of woman she was. She told me there was yet more. A man, of course, as there always must be. A black man, she said, her voice a growl. She knew I would be stunned and she loved that I was. She said how much it turned her on to be had by a black man. He lived only a few blocks away from the café we were in. She said, in fact, that while we had been sitting there he’d sent her a message on her phone asking if she wanted to come by to be laid. She talked about the size of him. The ebony muscles. —What does he do? I asked. I thought of the fish boy. She cast her thick tan neck back and laughed, hideously. —Zia, God help me, I think he sells drugs. —What? —I mean I know he does. He sells crack cocaine. He has a cot for a bed and his bathroom is a shared one down a dirty hallway. I love to be laid in his bed. I love how I feel lying there after it’s over. I feel like I’m bleeding out. I said I needed a cigarette. She laughed and we went outside and that was when the cough started. Of course it started sooner than that, but that was when I noted it. The first time I noted it. You can sense your own mortality more in the presence of someone who has found a new bead on life. I would like to tell you, if you care to know it, that I never learned to drive. I came to this country and never got behind a wheel. One of my first few months in the States I was talking to some girlfriends on a stoop in Orange. We were all smoking cigarettes. Some of us had children and on those afternoons when our husbands were at work we ran out of things to do by midday. In the summer the parks were too hot, the streets were too hot. Nowadays in July and August you can’t find any mothers in their hometowns, trying to fit their children’s bodies into hot metal swings. They are all at the beach, at the lake. Their families have houses somewhere with an ocean breeze, or they have cousins in Colorado with money and multiple bedrooms. Back when I was young it wasn’t like that and this one afternoon we were all smoking our long, thin cigarettes on the porch until suddenly this egg-colored VW bus pulled up on the curb. Behind the wheel was a woman. Back then we would have called her a broad. She had muscles like a man and denim coveralls with the sleeves crudely cut off at the elbow. Ladies and children, she called out her open window, I’ve got a one-way shuttle to Atlantic City. Climb aboard! We laughed. Some of our children jumped for joy. We didn’t know who she was or what was happening, but we got on that bus. All four of us, with five toddlers between us. We gave her money for gas and we stopped for cool drinks and drove down to Atlantic City, smoking and hooting out the window. When one could begin to see sand on the shoulders of the highway, I felt a pulse in my wrist. I met a man that afternoon, on the boardwalk. I dropped my purse and he picked it up and that’s how things used to happen. We walked together from one end to the other. He said he was a sailor but was dressed like a fisherman. We drank lime rickeys and ate raw oysters from a stand on a pier. I had never before eaten an oyster raw and I never would again. We did not make love under the boardwalk. We did not talk about husbands. We did not ask each other’s names. It was the only day I did not feel like the person I had left behind in my little village. That was the feeling Miranda inspired in me. She was not a good person but she did good for me the day she told me her story. She reminded me of my old, slopping heart. I watched her leave to go and meet the drug dealer down the road. I caught a bus home. My face was flushed like a schoolgirl’s. I felt normal. Nobody can tell me that a better feeling exists in the world. There came a soggy fall afternoon. The kind that feels stately, that even if you live in a not-beautiful place, the streets seem to glow with elegance. The leaves smelled dead in that very pungent way that is almost the opposite of death. Miranda, by then, was moved out of the little cape and the rumor about town was that she was addicted to drugs and living in Newark, under the bridge. Luke had gotten full custody, but then Miranda had not even shown up at the court. It was only in the past few weeks that people said she’d started coming around again, but nobody knew for sure. She was like a ghost. Linda Valenti, who lived next door, said she saw Miranda come after suppertime. Luke only cracked the door, would not let her in, would not budge an inch. Linda said Miranda must have lost fifty pounds. She was a twig. Her big black hair was thin and looked gray. She was screaming about her child. Let me see my little girl, she hollered down the middle-class streets. Linda said the whole block could hear it, and that’s when another woman said she had, in fact, heard a wailing. It was terrible, someone else suddenly agreed. The sound of a mother who missed her blood. You could not feel nothing for someone who had made a terrible mistake. But it wasn’t until that damp afternoon that I saw her myself. The day she came to see Sol. She knocked on the door loudly, then softly. She did look sickly but she still had her breasts. Her neck was still thick. Her hair, in the dark fall light, was not gray but the same terrific licorice everyone always went on about. He invited her in. She’d brought struffoli and a bottle of Cynar. They sat at the rosewood table in the dining room that was never used. Sol was very fat by this time. He was a doctor but an old one and old doctors were permitted to be fat. He was bald and pale but had an intelligent look to him, even when he was breathing heavily. She told him the story, everything except she left out the drugs and the color of the man she went with. It was over between them. He hit her in the mouth with his ringed hand. She showed Sol the spot where the tooth was gone. Sol leaned forward and held her face in his hand, surveying the damage. He said he had an oral surgeon friend who would fix it for her. Miranda was grateful. He poured them two glasses of Cynar and said he had not seen struffoli in forever. After some time Miranda began to cry and said she missed her child. That there was a pit in her heart. She was wearing a burgundy romper. Her legs were still brown and big. Sicilian blood works like the sun, tanning the flesh from the inside out. She consoled herself that Caroline was better off without her. But still, in the middle of the night her breasts ached for the child. Her whole body. She didn’t have money to get her own place. She couldn’t get partial custody without her own place. Luke wouldn’t let her even see the kid, the way she was now. Penniless, drawn. She was sleeping at the house of a woman she knew, indeed under the bridge, and at night the noise was so bad, the train and the screams, and it smelled like the kind of piss that was not merely old but diseased. Not like in Italy, she said, where the piss smells beautiful. Sol smiled. —You miss your kid, Sol said. —So fucking much. I feel like not just my heart, but like my lungs are torn out. She pulled at the skin between her chest viciously. —Sorry, Sol. He shook his head. She asked him what he thought. —Let me tell you a story, Sol said. About a beautiful woman. Miranda leaned forward. Beautiful women loved the stories of other beautiful women. They felt they could learn from them. —When I was completing my residency in Padua, I did my homework every night in this little café. I drank espresso then switched to wine around seven and the owner would give me whatever pasta they had a surplus of. There was a waitress there. The most beautiful woman I had ever seen, with black hair that dipped down below her rear. Like yours, maybe even thicker. She was twenty-six, old to be unmarried in those days. I only watched her from afar for a long time. I was a busy young man, learning not only medicine but Italian at the same time. —Forgive me, Sol, but why go to medical school in Italy if you don’t know Italian? Besides being attractive she had that other quality that women like her had. They knew which questions to ask. They knew the right questions all the time. —My family couldn’t afford medical school in the States. It was free in Italy back then, paid for by the government. All you had to do was practice at night in the hospitals. All night long, sometimes. —That’s a lot of hard work to do. —It was. Yes. Men these days don’t put the time in. You have to put the time in when you are young. And these days. Well, you know. They both laughed, because Luke was a writer. —When my last semester was over, I took her out. She was a very quiet woman. Of course we barely spoke the same language. —Did you have her right away, the first night? Sol smiled, the corned smile. All men have one, even the fattest and the kindest. —No, he said. The second one. And he winked. —Mind if I smoke? Miranda said. Sol got up. His largeness, it was like a prehistoric bird. He picked up an ashtray from the Albergo Lungomare in Rimini and set it on the rosewood table that was polished to a high shine. There was a hole in one of the windows of the hotel the ashtray was from and one morning he’d woken to find a crow at the foot of the bed. Staring. The crow was larger than the hole in the window. He took out a pack of cigarettes from the drawer of the armoire and lit her up with a 1930s Dunhill that had a deco swing arm. —Beautiful, she said. —Isn’t it. —So how was it? —It was wonderful, he said, but in that way men have where they aren’t thinking about the past. In prurient matters, men always live in the present. The past is just the fluffer. Of course in all other matters, sports and cars and presidents, men live in the past. I wish I could say I didn’t admire it. He proceeded to tell her the rest of the story, the lame leg of it. How the beautiful waitress had a child, a two-year-old for whom she could barely provide. Sol was almost done with school by the time he’d taken her out. He was set to go back to the States. His grandmother had recently passed and left him a good chunk of money to start his own practice; perhaps there would be enough left over to buy a house. But he was Catholic, his mother was a hard, hard woman. She painted little girls inside seashells but never laughed or smiled. He could not bring over a bride with a child by another man. He could not. Miranda sucked gluttonously on the cigarette. It was a Marlboro Red 100, left over from a stale soft pack. —What happened? —She came with me, he said. Before we left she set the child down, as it slept, inside the town chapel. Set it on the altar a few minutes before the mass would start. I gave her a roll of bills that she tucked inside the child’s blanket. We left for America. You know the rest. —Jesus Christ, Miranda said. She drank down the rest of her Cynar. —So you see, Sol said. Miranda shook her head. Maybe she did, and maybe she didn’t. She crushed out the cigarette. When she was done Sol covered her hand with his own. —You have a problem, Miranda. I see it. You’ve had a hard life. Don’t think I don’t understand. She nodded her big head, her full head of hair. —What can I do? —What can any of us do? Sol said, looking deeply into her eyes. His hand was big and pale over hers. He didn’t see how badly hers wanted to get out from under his. I have always wondered how some men are able to avoid seeing such things. But like the crow in the hotel room that morning, Sol was able to make a kind of sense of it, one that fit the math in his own head. Me, I knew the crow for what it was. That was the night, after all, that I made my decision, in that hot room with the ocean across the street and the boys hollering at the girls in the gelateria. Miranda started to cry. These were not the heaving tears I’d seen. These were the quiet, beautiful tears that beautiful women cry in front of unattractive men. They are not clear, these tears, but blue like sea glass. If you taste them you would find them salty and hard. —I can help you, Miranda, Sol said. And his voice turned throaty, filled with wetness and trees. I mean, he said, that I can help you with money. Here and there. He took her hand and brought it toward his giant legs. He wore huge and ghastly khaki shorts. The kind from the cheap department stores that men even older than himself shopped in. Pathetic, for a doctor, but of course after I was gone he had no one to shop for him. I had been unable to have any children. Everyone said it was a pity, and they didn’t even know the whole truth. I can only see when the lights are on and the lights soon switched off, and I stopped looking in for some time. Even after you stop wanting to learn, there is yet a greater boredom you can feel with life. Boredom is perhaps not the right word but I don’t know the word in English. The last thing I saw were the struffoli on the table. He’d plated them in a bowl I brought from the apartment I shared with my child. It was the only thing I brought to this country, and I am, if you care to know, sad to leave it.

        "story": "Harold Jamieson, once chief engineer of New York City’s sanitation department, enjoyed retirement. He knew from his small circle of friends that some didn’t, so he considered himself lucky. He had an acre of garden in Queens that he shared with several like-minded horticulturists, he had discovered Netflix, and he was making inroads in the books he’d always meant to read. He still missed his wife—a victim of breast cancer five years previous—but aside from that persistent ache, his life was quite full. Before rising every morning, he reminded himself to enjoy the day. At sixty-eight, he liked to think he had a fair amount of road left, but there was no denying it had begun to narrow. The best part of those days—assuming it wasn’t raining, snowing, or too cold—was the nine-block walk to Central Park after breakfast. Although he carried a cell phone and used an electronic tablet (had grown dependent on it, in fact), he still preferred the print version of the Times. In the park, he would settle on his favorite bench and spend an hour with it, reading the sections back to front, telling himself he was progressing from the sublime to the ridiculous. One morning in mid-May, the weather coolish but perfectly adequate for bench sitting and newspaper reading, he was annoyed to look up from his paper and see a man sitting down on the other end of his bench, although there were plenty of empty ones in the vicinity. This invader of Jamieson’s morning space looked to be in his mid to late forties, neither handsome nor ugly, in fact perfectly nondescript. The same was true of his attire: New Balance walking shoes, jeans, a Yankees cap, and a Yankees hoodie with the hood tossed back. Jamieson gave him an impatient side-glance and prepared to move to another bench. “Wait,” the man said. “I sat down here because I need a favor. It’s not a big one, but I’ll pay.” He reached into the kangaroo pouch of his hoodie and brought out a twenty-dollar bill. “I don’t do favors for strange men,” Jamieson said, and got up. “But that’s exactly the point—the two of us being strangers. Hear me out. If you say no, that’s fine. But please hear me out. You could...” He cleared his throat, and Jamieson realized the guy was nervous. Maybe more, maybe scared. “You could be saving my life.” Jamieson considered, then sat down, but as far from the other man as he could while still keeping both butt cheeks on the bench. “I’ll give you a minute, but if you sound crazy, I’m leaving. And put your money away. I don’t need it, and I don’t want it.” The man looked at the bill as if surprised to find it still in his hand, then put it back in the pocket of his sweatshirt. He put his hands on his thighs and looked down at them instead of at Jamieson. “I’m an alcoholic. Four months sober. Four months and twelve days, to be exact.” “Congratulations,” Jamieson said. He guessed he meant it, but he was even more ready to get up. The guy seemed sane, but Jamieson was old enough to know that sometimes the woo-woo didn’t come out right away. “I’ve tried three times before and once got almost a year. I think this might be my last chance to grab the brass ring. I’m in AA. That’s—” “I know what it is. What’s your name, Mr. Four Months Sober?” “You can call me Jack, that’s good enough. We don’t use last names in the program.” Jamieson knew that, too. Lots of people on the Netflix shows had alcohol problems. “So what can I do for you, Jack?” “The first three times I tried, I didn’t get a sponsor in the program—somebody who listens to you, answers your questions, sometimes tells you what to do. This time I did. Met a guy at the Bowery Sundown meeting and really liked the stuff he said. And, you know, how he carried himself. Twelve years sober, feet on the ground, works in sales, like me.” He had turned to look at Jamieson, but now he returned his gaze to his hands. “I used to be a hell of salesman—for five years I headed the sales department of... well, it doesn’t matter, but it was a big deal, you’d know the company. Now I’m down to peddling greeting cards and energy drinks to bodegas in the five boroughs. Last rung on the ladder, man.” “Get to the point,” Jamieson said, but not harshly; he had become a little interested in spite of himself. It was not every day that a stranger sat down on your bench and started spilling his shit. Especially not in New York. “I was just going to check on the Mets. They’re off to a good start.” Jack rubbed a palm across his mouth. “I liked this guy I met at the Sundown, so I got up my courage after a meeting and asked him to be my sponsor. In March, this was. He looked me over and said he’d take me on, but only on two conditions: that I do everything he said and call him if I felt like drinking. ‘Then I’ll be calling you every fucking night,’ I said, and he said, ‘So call me every fucking night, and if I don’t answer talk to the machine.’ Then he asked me if I worked the Steps. Do you know what those are?” “Vaguely.” “I said I hadn’t gotten around to them. He said that if I wanted him to be my sponsor, I’d have to start. He said the first three were both the hardest and the easiest. They boil down to ‘I can’t stop on my own, but with God’s help I can, so I’m going to let him help.’” Jamieson grunted. “I said I didn’t believe in God. This guy—Randy’s his name—said he didn’t give a shit. He told me to get down on my knees every morning and ask this God I didn’t believe in to help me stay sober another day. And if I did, he said for me to get down on my knees before I turned in and thank God for my sober day. Randy asked if I was willing to do that, and I said I was. Because I’d lose him otherwise. You see?” “Sure. You were desperate.” “Exactly! ‘The gift of desperation,’ that’s what AAs call it. Randy said if I didn’t do those prayers and said I was doing them, he’d know. Because he spent thirty years lying his ass off about everything.” “So you did it? Even though you don’t believe in God?” “I did it and it’s been working. As for my belief that there’s no God... the longer I stay sober, the more that wavers.” “If you’re going to ask me to pray with you, forget it.” Jack smiled down at his hands. “Nope. I still feel self-conscious about the on-my-knees thing even when I’m by myself. Last month—April—Randy told me to do the Fourth Step. That’s when you make a moral inventory—supposedly ‘searching and fearless’—of your character.” “Did you?” “Yes. Randy said I was supposed to put down the bad stuff, then turn the page and list the good stuff. It took me ten minutes for the bad stuff. Over an hour for the good stuff. When I told Randy, he said that was normal. ‘You drank for almost thirty years,’ he said. ‘That puts a lot of bruises on a man’s self-image. But if you stay sober, they’ll heal.’ Then he told me to burn the lists. He said it would make me feel better.” “Did it?” “Strangely enough, it did. Anyway, that brings us to this month’s request from Randy.” Jack also smiled. “I think you’re catching the sponsor-sponsee dynamic. Randy told me it was time to do my Fifth Step.” “Which is?” “‘Admit to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs,’” Jack said, making quote marks with his fingers. “I told him okay, I’d make a list and read it to him. God could listen in. Two birds with one stone deal.” “I’m thinking he said no.” “He said no. He told me to approach a complete stranger. His first suggestion was a priest or a minister, but I haven’t set foot in a church since I was twelve, and I have no urge to go back. Whatever I’m coming to believe—and I don’t know yet what that is—I don’t need to sit in a church pew to help it along.” Jamieson, no churchgoer himself, nodded his understanding. “Randy said, ‘So walk up to somebody in Washington Square or Central Park and ask him to hear you list your wrongs. Offer a few bucks to sweeten the deal if that’s what it takes. Keep asking until someone agrees to listen.’ He said the hard part would be the asking part, and he was right.” “Am I...” Your first victim was the phrase that came to mind, but Jamieson decided it wasn’t exactly fair. “Am I the first person you’ve approached?” “The second.” Jack grinned. “I tried an off-duty cab driver yesterday and he told me to get lost.” Jamieson thought of an old New York joke: Out-of-towner approaches a guy on Lexington Avenue and says, “Can you tell me how to get to City Hall or should I just go fuck myself?” He decided he wasn’t going to tell the guy in the Yankees gear to go fuck himself. He would listen, and the next time he met his friend Alex (another retiree) for lunch, he’d have something interesting to talk about. “Okay, go for it.” Jack reached into the pouch of his hoodie, took out a piece of paper, and unfolded it. “When I was in fourth grade—” “If this is going to be your life story, maybe you better give me that twenty after all.” Jack reached into his hoodie with the hand not holding his list of wrongdoings, but Jamieson waved him off. “Joking.” “Sure?” Jamieson didn’t know whether he was or not. “Yes. But let’s not take too long. I’ve got an appointment at eight-thirty.” This wasn’t true, and Jamieson reflected that it was good he didn’t have the alcohol problem, because according to the TV meetings he’d attended, honesty was a big deal if you did. “Keep it speedy, got it. Here goes. In fourth grade I got into a fight with another kid. Gave him a bloody lip and nose. When we got to the principal’s office, I said it was because he’d called my mother a dirty name. He denied it, of course, but we both got sent home with a note for our parents. Or just my mom in my case, because my dad left us when I was two.” “And the dirty name thing?” “A lie. I was having a bad day and thought I’d feel better if I got into a fight with this kid I didn’t like. I don’t know why I didn’t like him—I guess there was a reason, but I don’t remember what it was. Only that it set a pattern of lying. “I started drinking in junior high. My mother had a bottle of vodka she kept in the freezer. I’d swig from it, then add water. She finally caught me, and the vodka disappeared from the freezer. I knew where she put it—on a high shelf over the stove—but I left it alone after that. By then it was probably mostly water, anyway. I saved my allowance and chore money and got some old wino to buy me nips. He’d get four and keep one. I enabled his drinking. That’s what my sponsor would say.” Jack shook his head. “I don’t know what happened to that guy. Ralph, his name was, only I thought of him as Wretched Ralph. Kids can be cruel. For all I know, he’s dead and I helped kill him.” “Don’t get carried away,” Jamieson said. “I’m sure you have stuff to feel guilty about without having to invent a bunch of might-have-beens.” Jack looked up and grinned. When he did, Jamieson saw that the man had tears in his eyes. Not falling, but brimming. “Now you sound like Randy.” “Is that a good thing?” “I think so. I think I’m lucky I found you.” Jamieson discovered he actually felt lucky to have been found. “What else have you got on that list? Because time’s passing.” “I went to Brown and graduated cum laude, but mostly I lied and cheated my way through. I was good at it. And—here’s a big one—the student adviser I had my senior year was a coke addict. I won’t go into how I found that out, like you said, time’s passing, but I did, and I made a deal with him. Good recommendations in exchange for a key of coke.” “As in kilo?” Jamieson asked. His eyebrows went up most of the way to his hairline. “That’s right. He paid for it and I brought it in through the Canadian border, tucked into the spare tire of my old Ford. Trying to look like any other college kid who’d spent his semester break having fun and getting laid in Toronto, but my heart was beating like crazy and I bet my blood pressure was red-lining. The car in front of me at the checkpoint got tossed completely, but I got waved right through after showing my driver’s license. Of course things were much looser back then.” He paused, then said, “I overcharged him for the key, too. Pocketed the difference.” “But you didn’t use any of the cocaine yourself?” “No, that was never my scene. I did a line or two once in a while, but what I really wanted—still want—is grain alcohol. When I got a job, I lied to my bosses, but eventually that gave out. It wasn’t like college, and there was nobody to mule coke for. Not that I found, anyway.” “What did you do, exactly?” “Massaged my sell-sheets. Made up appointments that didn’t exist to explain days when I was too hungover to come in. Jiggered expense sheets. That first job was a good one. The sky was the limit. And I blew it. “After they let me go, I decided what I really needed was a change of location. In AA that’s called a geographic cure. Never works, but I didn’t know that. Seems simple enough now; if you put an asshole on a plane in Boston, an asshole gets off in L.A. Or Denver. Or Des Moines. I fucked up a second job, not as good as the first one, but good. That was in San Diego. And what I decided then was that I needed to get married and settle down. That would solve the problem. So I got married to a nice girl who deserved better than me. It lasted two years, me lying right down the line about my drinking. Inventing nonexistent business appointments to explain why I was home late, faking flu symptoms to explain why I was going in late or not at all. I could have bought stock in one of those breath-mint companies—Altoids, Breath Savers—but was she fooled?” “I’m guessing not,” Jamieson said. “Listen, are we approaching the end here?” “Yes. Five more minutes. Promise.” “Okay.” “There were arguments that kept getting worse. Stuff got thrown occasionally, and not just by her. There came a night when I came home around midnight, stinking drunk, and she started in on me. You know, all the usual jabber, and all of it was true. I felt like she was throwing poison darts at me and never missing.” Jack was looking at his hands again. His mouth was turned down at the corners so severely that for a moment he looked to Jamieson like Emmett Kelly, that famous sad-faced clown. “You know what came into my mind while she was yelling at me? Glenn Ferguson, that boy I beat up in the fourth grade. How good it felt, like squeezing the pus out of a boil. I thought it would be good to beat her up, and for sure no one would send me home with a note for my mother, because my mom died the year after I graduated from Brown.” “Whoa,” Jamieson said. His good feeling about this uninvited confession took a hike. Unease replaced it. He wasn’t sure he wanted to hear what came next. “I left,” Jack said. “But I was scared enough to know I had to do something about my drinking. That was the first time I tried AA, out there in San Diego. I was sober when I came back to New York, but that didn’t last. Tried again and that didn’t last, either. Neither did the third. But now I’ve got Randy, and this time I might make it. Partly thanks to you.” He held out his hand. “Well, you’re welcome,” Jamieson said, and took it. “There is one more thing,” Jack said. His grip was very strong. He was looking into Jamieson’s eyes and smiling. “I did leave, but I cut that bitch’s throat before I did. I didn’t stop drinking, but it made me feel better. The way beating up Glenn Ferguson made me feel better. And that wino I told you about? Kicking him around made me feel better, too. Don’t know if I killed him, but I sure did bust him up.” Jamieson tried to pull back, but the grip was too strong. The other hand was once more inside the pocket of the Yankees hoodie. “I really want to stop drinking, and I can’t do a complete Fifth Step without admitting that I seem to really enjoy...” What felt like a streak of hot white light slid between Jamieson’s ribs, and when Jack pulled the dripping ice pick away, once more tucking it into the pocket of the hoodie, Jamieson realized he couldn’t breathe. “... killing people. It’s a character defect, I know, and probably the chief of my wrongs.” He got to his feet. “Thank you, sir. I don’t know what your name is, but you’ve helped me so much.” He started away toward Central Park West, then turned back to Jamieson, who was grasping blindly for his Times... as if, perhaps, a quick scan of the Arts and Leisure section would make everything okay. “You’ll be in my prayers tonight,” Jack said.

        "story": "It is 1924. Günter Zeitz is thirty-three years old. His hair is black, unruly. And, in the manner of certain very tall men, he habitually hunches his shoulders and lets his head hang forward. He is standing on a street corner in Vienna, where he has just bid good day to Professor Freud and introduced himself. “Perhaps you remember me?” Günter says. “I wrote to you several months ago. I was working with Dr. Mohr.” This encounter is not an accident. Günter has come to Vienna from Coblenz specifically to meet the Professor, and a friend told him that Freud passes the corner of Hörlgasse and Liechtensteinstrasse every day after lunch. At the name Mohr, the Professor’s lip twitches impatiently under his yellow-stained mustache. “Did you not get my response?” His speech is impeded, as if he has a walnut in his mouth. “Yes. I appreciated your prompt—” “Then why are you here? Mohr is not a psychoanalyst.” The Professor lisps. He has to work to pronounce his s’s and r’s. “There is nothing I can do to help you.” Freud is carrying an umbrella, the point of which he lifts from the sidewalk as if to strike Günter on the shin. Just over his shoulder the black spires of the Votivkirche rise like a pair of demonic spruces. “I entirely agree!” Günter says. The Professor lowers his umbrella and tilts his head back to an angle that could make it seem as if he were looking down on the younger man. In fact, he is looking up. Freud is short, and skeletal inside his rumpled tweed suit. His eyes are gelatinous pools of amber and white within the black rings of his glasses. “He is superficial,” says Günter, his voice trembling, his mind whirling. “He has the best intentions, but. . . You are right: superficial. Intellectually. I knew that I had nothing to learn from him.” “His distinction between my work and Ferenczi’s is absurd!” “Yes,” says Günter. “Absolutely.” In fact, Günter has no idea what Mohr has said about Freud and Ferenczi. “When I read your Interpretation of Dreams, I felt that I understood the working of my own mind for the first time—how everything is connected, I mean. Our perceptions, thoughts, instincts, memories, fantasies. The past and present. And language, of course—puns! Everything is connected to everything else. All my life, I have had the sense that nothing is really what it is—from a linguistic point of view, I mean.” “Linguistic?” The Professor has taken a cigar out of his breast pocket and is searching his other pockets for a match. “I mean that language and logic oversimplify reality. The dictionary in conjunction with the grammar book make it seem that a stone is nothing but a stone. Whereas a stone is always also something to kick or climb or walk upon; a weapon, the foundation of faith, the image of courage, fidelity, coldness of heart. A thousand other things! And all of them at once! The poets know this, especially the French poets. Rimbaud, of course. And Reverdy. But not the philosophers. Wittgenstein. Do you know Wittgenstein? You must know Wittgenstein—he’s from here. A brilliant man. But also stupid. But my point is that you defy him. You speak what he consigns to silence.” Günter hardly knows what he is saying, and wonders if the Professor thinks he is insane. Freud grips the cigar between his teeth. He holds a lit match up to it and sucks. Ragged wreaths of smoke obscure his face. “Excuse me,” says Günter, “I’m babbling. It’s just that I’ve always felt—instinctively, I mean—that the world is a massive tangle of actualities. And your book helped me see clearly what I had never been able to articulate for myself.” “Young man,” the Professor says between one long puff and the next. “What did you say your name is?” “Zeitz. Günter Zeitz.” “And what is it that you want, Zeitz?” Günter’s mouth is entirely dry. His palms are wet. “I want to be a psychoanalyst, and I am hoping you will train me.” “You understand that your training will consist primarily of your own analysis? Five days a week, an hour a day. Is that agreeable to you?” “Of course.” “Do you have the money?” Günter hesitates a half-second. “Yes, of course.” The Professor looks up at him with a wry smile and releases a long plume of smoke that, intentionally or not, blows into Günter’s eyes. The Professor then quotes his hourly fee. Günter blanches. The Professor laughs. After a long silence Günter asks in a low voice, not meeting the Professor’s eye, “Would my analysis be with you, Professor?” “Of course!” There follows another long silence that Günter ends with a forced smile and the words, “Nothing would make me happier.” He knows that what he has just said is the absolute truth. He has been dreaming of being analyzed by Freud practically since he arrived in Heidelberg to start university. But as they shake hands, he can’t help but feel that everything about their exchange has been utterly false. Günter Zeitz is playing tennis on a sandy beach, but the net is composed of ripped shreds of corrugated steel, rusted pipes, tangled bridge cables, a gutted furnace. He cannot see his opponent, and he cannot hit the tennis ball over the net. Someone is shouting at him, urgently—warning him, perhaps—but in a language he cannot understand. “What?” he keeps saying. “What are you talking about?” Now he is no longer playing tennis. He is hanging from a kite high in the sky, or perhaps he is the kite, and a rope descends from him to a tiny figure on the beach—so tiny that Günter has no idea who that person is. And, in fact, the rope whips and swirls as if it were adrift in empty air. But Günter does not fall. He watches the foam of silent waves sliding up the sand, and the streak of the sun’s reflection on the rippling water. Where that reflection collides with the horizon, the sky breaks away from the sea. Inside the widening gap, Günter sees enormous machines—but not clearly. It is too dark. The darkness inside the gap is like a thick, brownish gas. Günter smells something burning. When he cranes around on the couch, he sees the Professor, eyes closed, resting his head against the wall, his chin cupped in the palm of his left hand. His right hand dangles limply off the arm of the chair and a cigar lies on the carpet, where it is burning a hole. “Professor Freud!” Günter calls. The Professor sits up suddenly, apologizes, then bends to pick up his cigar, as if he has placed it there intentionally. He looks at it, grips it between his teeth, and takes a meditative drag. Smoke pours out of his mouth in a yellow-gray wave. The Professor is dying, but he does not know he is dying, or he does not believe it, or he will not allow himself to know everything that death actually is. Six months before his sidewalk encounter with Günter, the Professor had his palate and the right half of his upper jaw removed to halt the progress of his cancer. An ill-fitting prosthesis of hard rubber edged with false teeth was inserted into the resulting cavity so that he might eat and talk. Invariably when Günter steps into the foyer of Freud’s apartment, the previous patient, a slender, dark-haired girl of twenty, is standing in front of the coat hooks getting ready to go down to the street. Her face is long and her chin is off-kilter, as if she fell when she was a child and it was knocked slightly to the left. But there is a dart of tension at the center of her brow that makes her impossible to ignore. Günter always says “Hello” when he first sees her and “Excuse me” as he reaches past her to hang up his coat. While she is careful to move out of the way of his arm, she never says a word or meets his gaze. Only when she is actually stepping through the door does she turn and look him in the eye, her thin lips a tight, straight line, her black eyes radiating an emotion that sometimes seems to be irritation, sometimes uncertainty, and sometimes abject fear. Sigmund freud: God has made them in the image of His own perfection; nobody wants to be reminded how hard it is to reconcile the undeniable existence of evil. . . with His all-powerfulness or His all-goodness. The Devil would be the best way out as an excuse for God; in that way he would be playing the same part as an agent of economic discharge as the Jew in the world of the Aryan ideal. But even so, one can hold God responsible for the existence of the Devil as well as for the existence of the wickedness which the Devil embodies. Günter is standing on the sidewalk talking to Anna Freud, whom he finds pretty in a humble and entirely unstudied way. She is four years his junior and he sometimes thinks he should be attracted to her. But he is not. “He refuses to go back to his doctor!” she says. “He seems to feel that this one operation has cured him.” A tremulous fluid glimmers along the rims of her dark brown eyes. Her mouth is open, lozenge-shaped, as if she can’t get enough air. “My mother lives in constant fear,” she says. “We’re all in despair!” At this instant, the door to the Freuds’ building clanks and the slender, dark-haired girl steps out, stops dead, and stares at Günter. No sooner does she see that he has noticed her than she turns and hurries off down the sidewalk, stopping twice to look back and stare at him again. The fact that she is on the street means Günter is late for his appointment. He apologizes to Anna and hurries into the building, taking the stairs two at a time. The Professor is always silent, so much so that several times during the weeks after the incident with the fallen cigar, Günter cranes his head around on the couch to make sure that Freud is still there and awake. The primary result of these episodes is embarrassment, because Günter always finds his famous analyst looking right at him from beneath a cloud of liver-colored smoke and has to suffer a gentle rebuke. The first time, Freud merely shakes his head and finger reprovingly. The second time, he smiles and says, “Oh, ye of little faith!” The third time, after the Professor says, “I’m always listening, and I hear your every word,” Günter asks, “Why are you playing God?” At first Freud seems taken aback; then he smiles. “Why do you say I am playing God?” “Because you are! It’s obvious.” Günter’s heart is pounding. He is surprised at the intensity of his anger. “On what evidence do you base this judgment?” Günter sits up and swings his feet to the floor so that he can see the Professor without straining his neck. Freud stirs his finger in a counterclockwise direction. “It would be best if you were to lie back down.” “That’s exactly what I’m talking about!” says Günter. “You’re always giving me commands—or commandments!” He meant the last two words as a minor joke, but Freud neither laughs nor speaks. There is a long moment during which Günter is afraid to meet Freud’s eyes, and when he finally does, the Professor looks profoundly bored. “Tell me more,” he says. Günter lifts his feet back onto the couch and lies down, both ashamed and relieved at his capitulation. “You accuse me of not having ‘faith.’ You tell me that you can hear my every word, which conveys the distinct implication that you can also hear my thoughts, even those inaccessible to me. And you are so silent. When I am lying here, I can’t even see you. You’re a perfect Deus absconditus! And you are terrifying! You know everything—you sit in judgment and you hold my life in your hands. If that doesn’t sound like God, I don’t know what does.” “Very interesting,” says Freud. “But I am wondering to what extent my God-like qualities are actually the result of anything I, myself, do.” From twelve-thirty to seven-thirty every weekday, Günter dissects the nervous systems of octopuses at the Physiological Institute of the University of Vienna. He has just finished work, and his hands smell of formaldehyde as he steps out onto Schwartzspanierstrasse. Shreds of gold and rose drift across a teal sky, and blackbirds in the scattered lindens of the park behind the Votivkirche conduct their pensive evening improvisations. A young woman in a forest-green cloche hat is sitting on a wrought-iron bench under one of the trees with an open book in her lap. In the granular dimness of the gathering dusk, Günter doesn’t realize she is the slender, dark-haired girl from Professor Freud’s office until he is directly in front of her. He stops. At first she seems entirely oblivious to his presence. Then her eyes rise slowly, as if in contemplation. When she spots Günter, her mouth falls open: “Oh!” “Sorry,” he says. “I didn’t mean to startle you.” “What are you doing here?” He gestures behind him. “I work at the Physiological Institute.” She closes her book. “How amazing!” She smiles, but in the semi-uncomfortable way a woman might smile at someone who has just squeezed in beside her on a streetcar. “What about you?” he says. She doesn’t seem to understand. “Why are you here?” “I live near here—on Glasergasse. I come here every afternoon to read. It’s so quiet. Relaxing.” He grunts in surprise. “I walk this way every evening, but I’ve never seen you.” “Well. . . ” She smiles again, but this time the smile is ironic. “No doubt you have much more important things to think about.” “Not likely!” He laughs. She doesn’t. He wonders if she is telling the truth. His first thought when he recognized her was that she had followed him from Freud’s building. There is a brief moment during which they both seem unable to think of anything to say. Then she lifts her hand as if to shake on a deal: “Josine Rosenthal.” “Pleased to meet you!” Günter shakes her hand. “Officially, I mean.” Her skin is cool and soft, her fingers so slender they seem to melt away in his grasp. He starts to speak: “I’m—” “Günter Zeitz!” she announces. “Doctor Günter Zeitz!” He laughs. “How did you know?” “The old man told me.” “Really?” “Oh, yes, he talks about you all the time!” Günter is more than a little surprised to hear that Professor Freud deems him worthy of discussion. “Nothing terrible, I hope.” She doesn’t answer, only looks up smiling, watching his face. “Uh-oh,” he says. She laughs. “You don’t have anything to worry about! In fact—” She cuts herself off. “Well, never mind.” “What?” “It’s nothing.” She freezes for a moment, her mouth open, her eyes vaguely mirthful. Günter waits, but the topic has been concluded. When Günter was four or five years old, he asked his mother what the phrase “I give up” means. They were in the kitchen. His mother was having coffee at the table. The world outside the windows was filled with sunshine. Crows called to one another from the trees. “Sometimes,” his mother said, “you want something to happen. You work very hard to make it happen, and maybe it is the only thing you can think about for a very long time. But then, one day, you realize that it is not going to happen, that there is nothing you can do to make it happen, and so you say, ‘I give up,’ which means that you are going to stop trying. You stop trying even if you still want that thing very, very much. ‘I give up,’ you say.” This explanation brought a terrible fear into Günter’s life, because what he thought his mother was saying was that when you “give up” on something you have decided to die. And there was something in the tone of her voice that made him think she herself might decide to die, that one day she would realize she was never going to get something she wanted dearly, and so she would give up on life—and thus abandon him absolutely and forever. Günter does not remember what made the notion that she would end her life seem so likely, or even why he would think anyone could possibly want to end their life. Nor does he remember where he first heard the phrase, or what made it stand out for him. He lived with this fear for many years. Günter is just taking a seat when the door to Professor Freud’s chambers opens and Fräulein Rosenthal dashes out. Günter instantly straightens up and steps toward her, smiling, preparing to wish her good day. A look of horror crosses her face. She waves her arm back and forth in the air between them, as if to erase him, then dashes into the foyer, grabs her coat and hat, and is out the door before she has even put them on. A few minutes later, the Professor opens the door to the waiting room, and Günter is still standing, looking at the front door. “Fräulein Rosenthal seemed upset,” he says. The Professor makes a non-committal noise. “She told me she ran into you on the street and you had a conversation. Is this something you’d like to discuss?” Günter suddenly feels a fierce aversion to telling the Professor anything at all about this strange woman. “Not particularly,” he says. “Very well then.” The Professor stands aside to let him into his office. Fräulein Rosenthal is sitting on the bench. “Hello,” she says, looking up and only half meeting Günter’s eye, as if she expects to be scolded. “It’s good to see you,” he says, anxiously running his fingers through his tangled hair. “I was worried about you.” She casts him a sharp glance. There is an open book in her lap—a collection of Jung’s essays. She seems mere pages from the end. Placing a slip of paper between the pages, she closes the book, holds it with both hands atop her knees, and looks up, her expression tense, though not angry. “I’m sorry.” She attempts a smile. “Things have not been going well for me lately.” “Professor Freud said you were ill.” “Did he?” She sighs heavily. “Well, you shouldn’t believe anything he says.” “Did something happen?” “He’s a charlatan and a fool!” Shocked by both the accusation and the ferocity with which it is made, Günter sits down beside her on the bench. “There must be some kind of misunderstanding.” “There’s no misunderstanding. He won’t listen to me, and he says things that are not true. And anyway, no man has the right to say such things to any woman.” She is echoing Günter’s own uncertainty about Professor Freud, but even so, he suspects there is something defensive in her rage, perhaps as a result of a prematurely rendered insight. “Do you want to tell me what happened?” Her eyes fall to the book in her lap. “No.” She looks over at him and attempts another smile. “It’s all so boring. I’d rather not think about it.” Adolf hitler: All this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true in itself—that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. Günter Zeitz and Josine Rosenthal are sitting in a noisy restaurant. At the center of their table stands a squat Chianti bottle in a straw bodice, with a candle stuck into its mouth. On the menu they find veal rollatini next to Wiener schnitzel and osso buco next to goulash. The waiter tells them the cook is Italian. They talk about Italy, where neither have ever been and both want to go. “Rome,” says Günter. “Florence,” says Josine. “Venice,” says Günter. “Yes, Venice,” says Josine. They laugh. They talk about oysters, garlic, the Sistine Chapel, Pompeii. They talk about the man across the room with the bright red face, whose eyes seem about to pop from his head. Their feet touch under the table. They apologize simultaneously. They laugh. They order oysters to share, and a bottle of Chianti. Josine orders the veal rollatini and Günter the osso buco. He thinks this meal will cost him a month’s rent, then decides not to think about it. They agree that Italians are much more alive than Austrians, Germans, or Swiss. They agree that the reserve of German-speaking people is due to the weather: the gray skies, the winters that kill off children, old people, livestock. Neither admits to being anxious or to hardly being able to wait for the wine to come. They agree that Jung’s idea of an inherited unconscious is uncomfortably close to National Socialist ideology. Are the National Socialists an actual threat? “Who knows!” says Günter. They both laugh. Günter asks and Josine answers, “Jewish. . . And you?” “I am nothing,” Günter says. “Religion makes no sense to me. I can’t believe in God.” “Then we are the same,” she says. The wine comes. They exchange bright glances and small smiles. They clink glasses. After her first sip, Josine says, “Now I have arrived in Italy!” “Where are you?” says Günter. “I’ve just gotten off a train in Rome.” “And where will you be when the bottle is finished?” “Venice!” They laugh. They toast. “To Venice!” The oysters arrive. Josine picks one up and holds it in front of her mouth. “This always feels like something people shouldn’t do in public. You mustn’t look at me!” But never once, as she touches her lip to the ragged shell edge, sucks the glistening gray glob onto her pink tongue and swallows, does she cease to stare into his eyes. “You didn’t do what I said!” she says. He lifts an oyster to his mouth and says, “Now you mustn’t look at me!” Their eyes never part. Günter swings his feet off the couch and sits up. “Do you mind?” The Professor shakes his head. “There is something I have been wanting to talk to you about for a long time,” says Günter. The Professor is silent. Günter continues: “I don’t see why you define aggression as a manifestation of the death drive. When a man fights for his life, or to protect his family, or to ensure his access to food, how is that not a manifestation of his desire to live and to preserve life, which is to say of the life drive and the pleasure principle?” Günter stops talking. Freud shakes his head and smiles. “My dear Zeitz, you will never become a true psychoanalyst unless you realize that the terrible force of our adversary, the unconscious, arises entirely from its profound and relentless irrationality. Look at the last war. In what way was that moral catastrophe a struggle to protect and propagate human life? And the same might be asked of these brown-shirted thugs in Bavaria. Our job as psychoanalysts is to defend our species from the worst effects of its ingrown perversity.” Günter emerges from Freud’s building and notices Josine standing two paces down from the door. She is looking at an old man on the sidewalk opposite pulling a child’s wagon loaded with candlesticks and rattling plates. Her brow is pinched, her mouth crinkled and white, and both her hands are balled into fists beneath the elbows of her tightly crossed arms. As Günter steps toward her, his shoe scrapes on the pavement, causing her to look his way. “Thank God!” she cries, but doesn’t move. “What’s the matter?” he says. “I wasn’t sure I could wait any longer!” She is shivering—even though the sun is out, the breeze is silky and warm, and she is wearing a coat. “Is something wrong?” he asks. “Are you ill?” Her laugh is hollow. “No, no. I just want you to do me a favor.” “What? I don’t have much time. I have to get to the laboratory.” “I want you to take me to your apartment.” “Why?” “I can’t tell you.” She laughs again. She rubs his shoulder. “I’ll tell you when we get there.” “But I can’t! I have to be at work in fifteen minutes.” “Tell them you’re sick. There was something rotten in your lunch.” “But why? What’s going on?” At this question, she places the knuckles of her fist against her lips. Then her hand falls, she stands on her toes, brings her lips to his ear, and whispers, “I want you to make love to me.” They walk with their arms around each other. Several times he stops to kiss her, half experimentally, half because it just seems something he should do. Once, on a vacant street, he slips his hand between the buttons of her coat and cups her breast through her blouse. She whispers in his ear, “Wait. Just wait.” Otherwise, they hardly talk. He mentions that he is becoming angry at Freud; she is not listening. Once they are inside Günter’s apartment, he becomes ashamed. His bed is unmade. His dishes from breakfast and last night are piled in the sink. His only window, curtainless, looks out into a grate-covered light well. The air smells of liverwurst and unwashed socks. Josine walks to the center of the room, turns, and says, “Here we are!” After that she just stands, blank-faced and listless, like a patient waiting in an examining room. He kisses her, and her lips are like spongy rubber across her teeth. Josine is sitting beside the table in her kitchen, elbows resting on her knees, hands on her temples, fingers in her hair. She is speaking in a low voice. “The next time was when my parents went to live in New York for six months and I stayed in his house so that I wouldn’t miss school. I was thirteen. He came to me every night. He told me he was teaching me how to be a woman. He told me I should be grateful. That my husband would be grateful. His wife knew. She wouldn’t even look at me at breakfast. And she wouldn’t talk to him. One day when we were passing in the hallway, she grabbed me by the shoulder and slapped my cheek. She told me I was a disgusting whore. I did tell my mother that she’d slapped me—though I said I had no idea why. When I told my parents I never wanted to see him or his wife again, that slap was my excuse. No one ever asked questions.” The Professor invites Günter to have dinner with his family. The pocket doors to the dining room are shut. Everyone waits in the parlor, sipping glasses of amontillado. Frau Freud and her sister, Fräulein Bernays, sit side by side on a leather couch, the one wearing a black shawl, the other white. They speak like a single brain in conversation with itself. When Frau Freud tells Günter, “We had been hoping our son—” Fräulein Bernays interjects: “Oliver, the famous counter—” “Minna!” cries Frau Freud. “What are you saying!” “He’s a counter,” Fräulein Bernays tells Günter. “He counts everything. If you asked, he could tell you exactly how many cigarettes there are in that bowl.” She points to a silver bowl at the center of the coffee table. “He would also know how many buttons there are on your shirt and how many eyelets in your shoes.” “It’s just that he’s mathematically inclined,” insists Frau Freud. “He’s an engineer.” “A civil engineer,” says Fräulein Bernays. “In Berlin.” “In Berlin,” affirms her sister. “We had been hoping that he would be visiting us now—” “—but his wife is pregnant.” “A difficult pregnancy—” “—so he doesn’t dare travel.” Günter is sitting on a chair directly opposite the sisters. Anna is just beside him. She plays no role in the conversation, though she does keep casting him glances and smiling in a way that makes her look as if she is gasping. She is expressing her own embarrassment, perhaps—or trying to ease his. No sooner had he walked into the apartment than he realized, from the glances exchanged between the sisters and the Professor’s uneasy frown, that he had been invited in the hope that an affinity might arise between him and Anna. The Professor hasn’t taken a seat. He is pacing along the wall, fidgeting, taking his hands in and out of his pockets, making querulous noises deep in his throat. “Oliver shows signs of obsessional neurosis,” he says. “I have been encouraging him to go into analysis with Eitingon, but he won’t listen to anything I say. He is a great disappointment.” The room falls silent. When the maid opens the doors to the dining room, everyone who has been seated rises. The Professor gives Günter a curt quarter-bow from the waist and says, “I will see you tomorrow!” There is a door just behind him. He opens it and leaves. Anna leans over and whispers, “Ever since his operation, he hasn’t eaten in front of anyone but the family. He wants, above all else, to retain his dignity.” Günter has no need of the toilet. All he wants is to escape the tedium of the polite dinner conversation he, Anna, her mother, and her aunt are working so hard to maintain. When he asks where he might find the water closet, Frau Freud nods toward the door through which her husband disappeared. “On the left,” she says. Günter finds himself in a dark hallway, with no discernible apertures along its left wall. He opens the first door on the right. While the interior is entirely lightless, he can tell from the smell of fur and the muffling of sound that it is a coat closet. The next door is to the bathroom, so the one just after must be to the toilet. But no. Sigmund Freud, in a sleeveless undershirt and rumpled trousers, is standing in the middle of a bedroom, holding a dress shirt by its collar and one tail, apparently checking for stains. The skin of his outstretched arms is crinkled and pallid, his muscles atrophied. A bush of gray-brown hair fans from his armpit. “Oh, sorry!” says Günter. Freud, startled, looks straight into Günter’s eyes. “Sorry,” Günter repeats, backing out the door. Freud is waving his shirt in the air, making off-key yawps and groans, the expression on his face desperate. Günter doesn’t know whether to pull the door all the way shut or step back into the room. On the table, beside the single bed, there is a plate, and on the plate, there is an object that looks like a lump of meat and teeth. Freud flings his shirt onto the bed and holds up one finger. As he makes his way toward the bedside table, he gives Günter a significant glance and, once more, holds his finger up. Günter remains motionless in the doorway. The Professor picks the object up off the plate and puts it into his mouth. After some adjustments requiring fingers from both hands, as well as much loud hacking and sucking that sounds like nothing so much as strangulation, Freud lowers his hands and says, “Ah, Zeitz! I was just thinking of you.” The night before coming to dinner at the Freuds’, Günter was eating at the Hotel Imperial with Josine; her brother, Josef; and her sister-in-law, Herta. “But he’s a laughable anachronism!” said Günter, a fork in one hand, a knife in the other, and a half-chewed bite of potato lodged in his cheek. “Not so laughable,” said Herta. “And not so anachronistic,” said Josef. Günter tongued the potato into the center of his mouth, chewed, took a sip of his wine. “He fills the streets with passionate Bavarians,” said Josef. “I wish they were anachronisms, but as far as I can tell, they are very much of our era.” Josine had hardly said a word all evening, but had been drinking wine at such a rate that her eyes no longer focused on any one point in space. Her elbows rested on the table, and she was holding her wineglass with both hands in front of her face, but so loosely it seemed in danger of falling onto her plate. “He’s a troglodyte!” said Günter. “His economic program is based entirely on an anti-Semitic fantasy, so it is guaranteed to fail. He may appeal to the credulous Protestant petite bourgeoisie, but all people really want are jobs. If he ever actually follows through on his promises, there’ll be rioting in the streets, the stock market will plunge—people won’t stand for it!” Günter is sitting on the corner of the Professor’s bed. Freud, still in his sleeveless undershirt, is sitting on a wooden desk chair, one hand on each of his knees, fingers spread, clutching the knobby bones underneath. “I was once like you,” he says, “believing there was a nobility to certain ideas—or a veracity—that allowed them to transcend the minds in which they were conceived and through which they passed.” Günter is filled with a frantic restlessness. All he wants is to make his excuses and leave, but he is incapable of resisting the Professor. “You know Rilke, of course,” says Freud. “Yes,” says Günter. “Not personally, but. . . ” He doesn’t finish. “One afternoon,” says Freud, “I was walking with him through the countryside. It was a summery day in early September. The sun was golden, the fields filled with flowers. But he denied that any of it was beautiful. The fact that it would wither in mere weeks filled him with despair.‘There is no beauty apart from the eternal,’ he said. I thought that the most juvenile of affectations and had to restrain my irritation as I argued that the very transience of the beauty around us only made it more precious—” “Even its transience is transient,” says Günter, hoping to anticipate Freud’s points and thereby hasten the end of this interview. The Professor waves away the interruption. He is standing now, pacing in front of the bed, his feet bare and veiny, his toenails thick, in need of clipping. “Yes. Of course,” he says. “I made that point too. But my main argument was that beauty is intrinsic to the beautiful object, to its particular configuration of color, form, structure, and so beauty is independent of context. Thus, if an object is beautiful in a particular instant, it is always beautiful, and in that way eternal.” “What did he say?” “Oh, he was as contemptuous of me as I was of him. He thought I was naïve, blinded by scientific pragmatism. I came away from that conversation thinking I had wasted my time. But I have been arguing with Rilke in my mind ever since: every time I contemplate a beautiful idea, whenever I think there might be something redemptive in the life drive, or even in aggression, insofar as it is the force of conscience, I wonder if Rilke would think me vacuous, self-deceived. And tonight, it came to me in a flash: Rilke was right! I am vacuous! I’ve been living in a fantasy!” Freud stops pacing, his emaciated arms stiff at his sides, his hands in tight fists, his old man’s face constricted, yellowed, insect-like. “There is, in fact, no beauty apart from the eternal—which is the opposite of existence: a void, a nothingness, airless, endless, dark and dead, in the midst of which existence—especially human existence—is a senseless accident. And when we encounter the eternal, we encounter only its absolute and implacable indifference to us, which our flesh-bound minds can conceive of only as cruelty. And this is the most important thing, because as cruelty, the eternal seems so magnificently heedless that it feels like pure freedom to us, and so it is awe-inspiring and profoundly beautiful: the only thing in all of creation that we can truly love. And in most people, such love takes one of two forms: either we make ourselves abject before the eternal in the hope that it will not destroy us, which is to say that we worship it; or we attempt to take the eternal into ourselves, which is to say that we make ourselves the agents of its cruelty.” Freud has stopped speaking. His eyes inside the round lenses of his glasses are fixed on Günter. They glitter. They do not move. Günter looks away. His mouth has gone dry. When at last he draws a breath to speak, Freud’s arm flies out, palm flat, upraised. “Stop! No words!” Günter is at a party in a palace ballroom. The women are dressed in ankle-length gowns of muted floral colors. Most of the men wear tuxedos with silk waistcoats, though some are in military uniforms with chin-high collars and heavy medals arrayed across their chests. A string quartet is playing, while overhead naked men and women float amid the gold-tinged clouds of a summer sky. Günter holds a glass of wine and is talking to a woman who looks like a little girl in her mother’s clothing. The sleeves of her green satin gown are rolled up at her wrists, and its skirt rumples against the polished floor. She too holds a glass of wine, but she is weeping. When Günter asks what is wrong, she tells him, “You shouldn’t be here.” “Why?” he asks. “Because you are dead.” And now it seems that he is walking beneath an umber sky, the palace a heap of smoldering rubble behind him. He crosses its ruined terrace and descends a set of steps into a gully, where a gray dog lies on its belly in long grass—it is Schatzi, the Weimaraner mutt Günter’s family owned when he was a child. “Hey, girl!” Günter crouches and holds out his hand. The dog stands. It slinks toward him, sniffs his fingers, then bares its fangs and lunges. Günter leaps back and kicks, feeling the impact of his foot against the dog’s skull. The dog yelps, reels, and runs. It has something in its mouth: a piece of bloody meat. Günter looks at his sleeve, which seems to have been brushed with red paint. He wonders if the sleeve has been ripped but cannot tell. Another dog is slinking out of the grass, head lowered, fangs bared, and now another, then several more. Günter is surrounded. The dogs are closing in. He has no choice but to fight.

        "story": "As promised in the email she’d received, the shuttle was waiting at the curb outside baggage claim. It was just a minivan, it turned out, not the wheeled and finned amphibious contraption she’d been vaguely expecting from its mysterious name, SeaTac–Whidbey Island Shuttle. The shuttle’s doors were open; a driver was checking names off a clipboard. A frowsy older couple in matching rain jackets; a likely student plugged into her earbuds; and a very tall man, who was busily befriending the others with an eye, he told them cheerfully, to getting the seat with the most legroom. This turned out to be in the first row, while Leila wound up in the second, but the tall man, who had begun talking to Leila the instant his eyes lit on her, continued once they were seated, twisting his long torso to half-face her over his shoulder. “Coming home?” he asked, and his abrupt address paired with his singular physical presence surprised her into something like alacrity, a state she’d been so far exiled from for so long she hadn’t even remembered its name. “No,” she replied. “Are you?” And when he said yes, in fact he’d lived on the island at one point for more than ten years, the conversation went from there, simply bloomed and sent tendrils all over the minivan’s grimy interior as if there weren’t ultimately nine people crammed inside, including themselves and the driver. They’d had to interrupt themselves to listen with impatient politeness when the driver gave his spiel about schedule and safety. Perhaps she hadn’t quite reclaimed alacrity. Information tumbled from the tall man, place names and business concerns and waterways; at one point he broke eye contact with her to look down at his phone, but before she could seize the opportunity to muster her focus he handed the phone to her, its screen displaying a three-masted boat. How beautiful, she said automatically. Just the previous week she’d brought her sons home from Martha’s Vineyard on that island’s ferry, their first time visiting as a trio (she’d made mistakes there, also, forgetting to reserve parking in Hyannis, ending up paying three times the usual rate to a sailor-suit-wearing cabal of criminal Moldovans, as she called them, to the distress of her sons, who felt, rightly, she knew, that this was an insensitive stereotype), and when the van halted again, here, just as there, were the painted lines on the asphalt where the soon-to-be-passenger cars formed their columns to wait, and here just as there was a concession stand offering seafood standards, even New England clam chowder. Leila stood in line for a bottle of water and then rejoined the tall man, who had seated himself on the back of a bench. How long had it been since she’d had this sensation of instant camaraderie with a man? But in fact, she reminded herself, she’d once made friends with men all the time, when in her right mind, to which this trip had been meant to return her. The tall man took from his backpack a very good-looking sandwich. Leila took in its toothsome-appearing whole-grain bread, its crisp lettuce, its fat slice of tomato, its strata of cheeses and meats, as the tall man with somehow fastidious wolfishness dispatched the sandwich in a very few bites, without dirtying his fingers, his clothes, or his face. It hadn’t crossed Leila’s mind to buy food while she stood in the line, and now she realized she hadn’t eaten since around eight the previous night—Eastern time—and it was now almost one on this coast, which meant it had been twenty hours since her last meal. “You’re prepared,” she remarked, of the sandwich, and the man replied, “My wife is,” with an appreciative nod at the now-empty Ziploc that he folded up neatly and returned to his backpack. So that was that, Leila thought, for the first time aware that the long-unused apparatus had begun to unfurl. Better fold that back up, like the Ziploc. When the ferry came in, the tall man led her up its two metal staircases with their metal walls and diamond-plate treads, which still somehow conveyed the excitement of going to sea. Though he seemed to know he towed her in his wake he didn’t hesitate to use his long legs, and he didn’t glance over his shoulder—she had to hurry to keep up with him. Then they came out into the enormous indoor passenger area with its superfluous seating for hundreds and beautiful wraparound windows in the forgotten modernism of the late 1950s. Leila’s pulse quickened with pleasure. This was the kind of erstwhile sophisticated interior she and her husband had always sought out. The decades of their accord had lulled her into thinking theirs was everyone’s preference; but the tall man was making straight for the doors to the outer deck, and Leila didn’t even have time for a photo. Then they were standing together on a wide balcony spanning the bow, with the heavy green water spread around in an arc and the dark green landmasses crouched regarding the boat from their various distances. Leila couldn’t guess which landmass was which. She wished she’d studied a map. Around the port side she could see a pretty lighthouse she would have liked to go look at, but the tall man’s easy cooptation of her company somehow ruled out all such tourist’s behaviors. He was explaining his reason for coming, and just as, curbside back at the airport, his question to her had shocked her into alacrity, now the superior solitude of the ferry deck and the surrounding dark water shocked her into greater attention, as if her consciousness were being awakened by increments. From the corner of her eye she could see the couple in their matching raincoats gazing out through one of the rhomboid windows from the passenger area, but they didn’t venture onto the deck. No one did, despite the mildness of the wind. Leila asked the tall man a series of questions, and though his replies let her know that he’d explained much of this already, still she felt the satisfying tightness of the grip of her mind on the interesting problem, this stranger whose world didn’t overlap with hers in the least. It didn’t seem to bother him to tell her things twice. Suddenly she laughed—the laughter shook free of her without warning and only once it had did she fathom her reason for laughing, which she tried to explain as he smiled with surprise, not the least offended by the interruption. “I didn’t realize we were moving!” she cried. The barely wrinkled green water lay around them like pavement over which the ferry rolled with imperturbable tires; it was only when she noticed that behind the tall man’s back, where he leaned against the rail facing her, the featureless crouching landmass had grown tall and sprouted houses whose individual features she could easily see that she was even aware they’d cast off. But how could she explain to him that it wasn’t just the smoothness of the ride but the feeling of herself magically transposed—as if lifted by a giant’s hand and smoothly set down again? “I mean, I didn’t even realize we’d started!” “It’s not always like this,” he said. “We’re lucky to have a calm day.” As Leila and the tall man headed back down he said, “What’s your heritage, if you don’t mind me asking?” It was the question she would have asked him if such questions weren’t, now, a minefield. Leila welcomed the question when it came from another brown person but would not have assumed other brown people felt the same way. She explained herself and, when he replied, “It worked out very well. Nice results,” wasn’t sure whether she was more pleased by the hint of flirtation or by the fact that, in seeming to flirt, he’d crossed a behavioral line that enabled her to feel faultless when she asked the question back. “Oh, that’s an interesting story,” he said. “White father and Native American mother—or so my mother claimed. It turns out—” There had been many other divagations, in the course of which they dropped off the raincoat couple at a rent-a-car and rocketed on down the narrow highway that lay like a trench between black pines and beneath a dull sky. Leila was aware she felt stirrings of dread when the van stopped again abruptly and the driver hauled the side door open. “Freeland,” he called. This was Leila’s stop. Now her feeling was actual panic, as she groped toward the rectangle of light and the driver yanked her suitcase from the rear and dumped it onto the pavement. “I didn’t get your name,” she tried to say casually over her shoulder as she managed the awkward step out of the van. “Lance. I didn’t get yours.” “Leila.” No sooner had she spoken her name than she doubted her understanding of his. Lance? Like a spear? “Leila?” a new voice asked—her ride to the colony. She turned toward it as if not feeling what she felt, and the minivan was gone so quickly that even her sense of its absence seemed foolish. Illustration by Seo Kim The colony was only for women. Leila had learned about it from a colleague years before and had held off applying perhaps due to some unease or shameful snobbery, perhaps the same internal impediment that had kept her from admitting that her marriage was afflicted by all the same problems about which her girlfriends complained, until it was too late and the whole worm-eaten edifice turned to powder, leaving hardly a trace of the two decades it had endured. When this happened her scruples (or whatever the obstacle) vanished, and she applied to the colony and was admitted for a few weeks, almost eighteen months into the future. She couldn’t imagine what good it would do her then. But when the time arrived in fact no part of her catastrophe had been resolved. She could barely pack, not from reluctance to go but from the sense she was running toward refuge from a fire or a flood, and packing was a superfluous nicety. Why bother to bring anything? Now, though, the reality of the colony began to take form like so many bands circling her chest, one for each rule her greeter explained. There was no internet as this disrupted solitary meditation. Cell coverage was very poor throughout the island and nonexistent at the colony, but should she miraculously find herself with service, it was asked that she desist from making or receiving calls on the property, as this disrupted solitary meditation. There was no meat served on the property nor television watched nor perfume worn, given certain sensitivities; the rustic accommodations were exceptionally beautiful but, it seemed, equally fragile; the prefix phrase “we ask that” recurred like a mantra: “We ask that you leave shoes outside on the mat and walk only barefoot or in slippers or socks in the cabins, as the fir floors get scratched,” said her greeter. “We ask that you use the provided towels to wipe dry the walls and floor of the showers after each use, to inhibit mold growth. These towels are only for wiping the shower; they’re not for your personal use. You did bring your own towel, right? We ask that you place nothing on the windowsills; the lovely wood they’re made of is easily damaged. We ask that you descend from the sleeping loft facing the stairs, with both hands on the railings; we’d hate to have you fall. We ask that you abide by the quiet hours of ten p.m. to seven a.m.; please no music between those times. The cabins might be widely separated but in these quiet woods noises carry. We ask that you take the time to read the reflective words of the residents who have preceded you, which are recorded in these notebooks, and that you record your own reflections for the women who follow; you’ll want to do that in the most recent volume, which is number fifteen. Please don’t write in any of the other ones even if you find a blank page. We ask that you try not to leave a blank page between the end of your predecessor’s reflections and the beginning of yours, the way some of the women have done. It wastes space in the notebooks. We ask that you arrive promptly to meals, read the fireplace instructions with great care, move no items of furniture. We ask that in the garden you feel free to pick flowers but not vegetables—if you want to have dinner.” Above all, no guest was allowed without the prior permission of all the other colonists—dinner was a good time to seek this—and no overnight guest, or man, was allowed, period. “So only women can visit?” Leila sought to clarify. “It’s a women’s retreat,” said her greeter, as if the implications should be obvious. It was, of course, a sort of monastery—nunnery? perhaps “cloister” was the less religious term—and once alone in her cabin Leila understood that it had not been the rules themselves but the presence of the greeter that had felt like bands circling her chest. Something about that greeter reciting the rules had reminded Leila, yes, of her husband, regardless of the fact that the greeter had been a seventy-year-old woman with her silver hair piled in a bun. With the greeter gone, the rules shifted the nature of their encirclement. Now Leila regarded the flawlessly ordered interior of her cabin with such abject gratitude that her eyes overflowed; interestingly, an open box of Kleenex sat on every surface: one on the desk, one on the side table next to the armchair, one on the bedside table, and one beside the bathroom sink; four boxes of Kleenex for a cabin no more than two hundred square feet, a higher concentration than even in Leila’s therapist’s office. Leila sat down in the window seat, within reach of the armchair side table, and cried, luxuriantly ripping tissues from the mouth of the Kleenex box without regard for how many she used. We ask that. When had Leila, a popular teenager, a brilliant college student, a successful young woman, lost the ability to ask that her own existence be ordered in the way that pleased her? Her hard cry lasted so long she became bored with it; she felt enormously better. She lugged her suitcase into the sleeping loft, where the chest of drawers was, and stood for a time wishing there were rules about how to unpack. In a monastery surely the monks had a place for each cowl or whatever it was. With some difficulty she unpacked her few, poorly chosen clothes with extreme care, as if each drawer were laid open for judgment by God. She descended again, facing the stairs with both hands on the railings, and then went for a walk in the woods. The woods were exquisitely beautiful. Leila wished for more rules to protect them—We ask that you not tread on moss, We ask that you pluck no wildflower—but perhaps it was the colony’s rules for itself that enabled the woods to remain so pristine. Once awoken to the need for such rules, everyone made her own. The first thing she’d wondered about the tall man, Lance, was his age; she’d wondered about that even perhaps before she’d wondered about his heritage or ancestry or whatever was the currently palatable word. No, she’d wondered about the two at the same time. She had to admit it: she’d gazed on his brown skin, adjusted. Taut at the jaw, the slightest loosening under the ears. Dark hair barely dusted and perhaps that was only the light. He’d confounded her. When in doubt, she dialed down. No more than forty-five, she decided, then reminded herself this made him younger than her. As if he’d observed her internal debate he had told her, “My wife’s fifteen years older than me. She had the two oldest kids when we met. Then together we had Julia. I’m sixty-one; my wife’s seventy-six.” They had been climbing back into the shuttle to get aboard the ferry when he’d made this revelation, in front of all their fellow passengers, as if she’d asked him to provide credentials. For the rest of their time together she’d tried to press his age onto him like a hat. It was cheering how poorly it fit. Everything about him seemed youthful: his bright eyes, his hawk’s nose, his plentiful dark untrimmed hair, his leather jacket, the wrought-iron pendant he wore on a thong around his neck. Yet at the same time he was reassuringly adult: the jacket’s leather was supple and unstained, and the reading glasses he’d briefly put on while searching his phone for the photo of the boat were far more stylish and expensive-looking than Leila’s own readers, which she had bought at the grocery store. Strongest evidence of all, his teeth were the faint yellow of aged ivory: they lent the rest of the illusion authenticity. Like the ferry Leila had not felt transporting her over the water, Lance perhaps moved through the world without friction, aging at a fraction of the usual rate. Transplanted into fiction his appearance would be as implausible as his name. “Ancestry.com,” he’d been telling her as they clambered back onto the shuttle and for the third time took their seats, for the final and shortest leg of the trip. The website had been how he’d found out that his maternal ancestors weren’t Native American at all, as his mother had always said, but African-American Creoles from Louisiana. Whether that information had been inadvertently lost or someone had covered it up wasn’t clear; Lance was still in the throes of his research. And not only that, but he’d found a whole branch of relations, descended from an illegitimate child of his grandmother’s sister. That pregnancy was a secret that no one had known until now, but they had all found one another, and they were having reunions. His own mother, aged ninety, who remembered her aunt, had been able to share stories of their ancestress with the grandchildren who’d had no idea, before now, what their background might be. It had been this tale, frankly enthralling to Leila, that the shuttle driver had interrupted with his harsh cry of “Freeland!” and his violent yanking open of the minivan’s door. All that had welled up in Leila to say in response had tumbled back down her throat. The reasons Leila’s marriage had failed seemed to multiply with every day since its extinction. Early on, despite the mental disarray of grief, Leila had felt she was able to describe the trouble fairly concisely. In retrospect, her concise description came to seem spurious. It might have been a product of self-delusion, or of false consciousness instilled by her husband, or even, paradoxical as this seemed, both. Every aspect of the marital reality now seemed the product of her feeble subjectivity: perhaps she and her husband had not even liked midcentury modern interiors. Perhaps only her husband had liked them and she had pretended she did, to please him. Perhaps she had liked them and he’d humored her. Perhaps no one had liked them and it had all been a misunderstanding. Perhaps their experience of love—if they had even experienced it—had been a misunderstanding as well. At the women’s retreat, Leila floundered. She couldn’t seem to break through the skin of the place. It was a perfectly translucent skin through which she could see the stately trees, the charming cottages, the dewy flowers, the serenely smiling other women, but she could not pierce that skin, could not seem to get on the right side of it. She found more and more pretexts to loiter in the retreat’s library, where one afternoon, on her fourth or fifth day, her non-reading was disturbed by the sudden entrance of a woman—a visitor from nearby, it turned out—who said, “Look at you, so serene! At least there’s one place around here that’s not crawling with wooden-boat tourists.” It took Leila a moment to grasp why this sounded familiar. It had been a wooden-boat festival, on the next island over, to which Lance had said he was going. Until now it had not crossed her mind that this event might be real. It had not crossed her mind that a mere call to a cab company, such as she made the next morning, then a mere ferry ride, would bring the festival under her nose before she’d entirely decided to go. She still hadn’t entirely decided to go when the festival greeted the ferry far ahead of the shoreline; of course, it was a boat festival—it would be taking place largely out on the water. Up and down the ferry railing under the early morning sun Leila’s fellow passengers crowded to see the small boats on the mirrorlike water. Then the boat Lance had shown her on his phone appeared alongside a pier. Leila recognized it so easily that she doubted herself. What had she remembered from that photo? It seemed unlikely she would have recalled that it was a three-masted boat with a midnight-blue hull, but as if to remove any lingering doubt, a strikingly tall dark-haired man strode down the pier toward the boat; then the angle of the ferry’s approach made this view disappear. Leila found herself alone at the railing. The ferry was docking; the other passengers had already gone down. Leila reminded herself that nothing she was doing was wrong, that her husband had left her eighteen months ago and, though he was still living in the guest room, he had hired a lawyer. She had hired a lawyer, too, and her lawyer, a woman, had said to her, Go forth and date. Even that had been six, eight, or ten months ago. Leila couldn’t remember. Onshore she drifted among the tables and stalls as if she’d never seen the boat and Lance at the end of the pier. It was a painfully charming Victorian seaside town; everything Leila laid her eyes on was like the life-size version of a toy of an aristocratic child of times past, as if she’d stepped into the nursery of, who was it, perhaps those moody jerks from Brideshead Revisited. As if to twist the knife of nostalgia for a past never lived, a brass band performed on a bunting-draped stage, whittlers whittled, scrimshaw was displayed. There was also no shortage of twenty-first-century culture, of displays on behalf of endangered orcas or opportunities to buy vegan food, but these only increased Leila’s sense of dispossession. She would rather have lived long ago. At least then the world wasn’t so obviously ending. Thank God, here was exactly what she needed: a very esoteric guide to tying knots (Aidan) and a fold-your-own-fleet paper kit (Dashiell); they would even fit into her suitcase. Clear as a dream, she saw her suitcase flying over the railing while she stood on the ferry with Lance; saw its blunt corner dent the dark water, the water recoil and spring back, the suitcase regrettable jetsam rapidly shrinking and then lost in the wake. That hadn’t happened. Extremely carefully Leila stowed her purchased souvenirs for her two unforgotten children in the most sheltering part of her backpack and suddenly knew Lance had strode rapidly down the pier because he was departing. Yesterday, out the window of her cottage, she had seen a chickadee bouncing around the branches of a fir like a freshly whacked pinball. Now her heart was behaving this way. Leila quickly walked toward the water, seeming to bump into something—a table, a person, a trash can—at every step. A premonition of old age—her poor parents were like this, they drove to the Y every morning to slow-motion walk in the pool to maintain their balance. But how ironic it was that they drove there—they must have paid bribes to renew their licenses; one of these days they’d wind up in a ditch. Or worse. Leila flying to visit them monthly, unable to talk them into moving closer to her and now, with her impending pennilessness, having to consider moving back in with them—but her husband would never allow it. Shared custody; his job was in New York. It was already a foregone conclusion that they would have to sell the old house they had worked so hard on, side by side, stripping the paint from the doorframes. Halted on the waterfront walkway, buffeted on all sides by festivalgoers, Leila could not see Lance’s boat but knew it had to be off along the water to her left, as the ferry was off along the water to her right. She would turn right. It was not even lunchtime. She’d forgotten, disembarking, to check the return schedule, but it didn’t matter; she would go back to the ferry and wait. “So you decided to check it out,” said a friendly and unsurprised voice. “Great timing. Julia’s all rigged and ready to go.” In memory she’d smoothed out some of the minor irregularities of his face, slightly diminished the true dimensions of the beaklike nose, but he was otherwise exactly as he’d been however many days before. It must be some trick of the brain, perhaps particularly on its guard against abrupt variations, that made this man with whom Leila had only ever spent ninety minutes less than one week before seem so hyperintensely familiar when the face of Leila’s own estranged husband was mush in her mind. Though it was less how Lance looked that was familiar than his affect—his affect, in fact, of finding Leila so familiar. As before he seemed to feel entirely assured of her company. Hurrying again to follow him, she wondered if in fact during their prior conversation they’d made a date she’d forgotten for her to come and see his boat? But he strode not with impatience, just that same unrestrained, unconscious speed of a long-legged person. “So we’ve had a looooot of work to do,” he was telling her as if resuming a complicated conversation in which she’d been a fully educated participant. Was it men who were mostly like this? Voluble rivers of action and thought? No, that was ridiculous. Leila knew plenty of women who were rivers of action and thought, carving paths with their waterweight and not caring a twig if the flotsam flowed with them or not; and as well she knew plenty of men who were inactive flotsam. Now Lance, whose outpourings had not paused while she pondered their nature, was handing her onto the boat—Mind the cleat—she wouldn’t believe this but the people he’d entrusted this boat to had neglected or misunderstood but in a way it had all turned out better because of thesepeople his usual kismet particularly the thing with his wife and the whale. So what did she think? Of the boat. Maybe improved for her misadventure? “What about your wife and the whale?” Leila asked, struggling to follow. “That dream she had that I told you about on the shuttle—the mother whale with two calves? In the dream the mother whale tells my wife, The whales need you! My wife says, I’m headed to Haiti, where the poor people need me, are these whales in Haiti? Should I cancel my trip? My wife has a history of visions and premonitions. I could tell you some stories. Anyway, after lots of debating she goes through with her trip to Haiti, I come here, Julia’s a fucking mess, the people I left her with didn’t know what they were doing, but luckily the best riggers in the world are all hanging around here all week, I get busy but these things can’t be rushed, I’d originally planned to leave Tuesday but I’m still here Wednesday, yesterday, when the orca-watch people come into the bar where I’m having my lunch. It turns out, their whale-spotting boat has been rammed by these right-wing assholes and they can’t do their annual count. There I was, on the brink of being done with outfitting Julia to sail her down to Big Sur, where I happen to not have a berth. I didn’t really know what I was going to do with her, and then here came the orca-watch people. I said, Here’s your boat. When I called my wife, she just couldn’t stop laughing. She said, Why didn’t the goddamn whale mother appear in your dream? And I said, Remember how I never remember my dreams? That whale mother had to leave me a message with you. So I’m off to Orcas tomorrow,” he concluded. “Want to come?” “Me?” Leila exclaimed when it was clear, from his expectant silence, that he was not only finished telling his story but had actually asked her this question. “Yes, you. Aren’t you looking for something like this?” “What would make you say that?” “People find their way to us, my wife and me, all the time. People who are looking for something, or who just need to be somewhere. I thought that might be your situation. To be honest, I thought that you might be the whale mother. You have two sons, right? In my wife’s dream, the whale mother had two calves. Sometimes my wife’s dreams are symbolic, not literal.” The boat—Julia—was shifting subtly and rhythmically beneath them; even still water can never be still if it’s part of the ocean. Leila unprecedentedly perceived that the ocean was truly one body, lying beneath the eyes of her children as they rode the Q train over the Manhattan Bridge to school in the morning no less than it lay against the hull of Julia, atop which she now sat. Connecting Leila to her children and to whale mothers and calves and all the other millions and billions of creatures suspended in ocean translucence like the raisins and grapes Leila’s mother suspended in quivering rings of grape Jell-O, which had been, in her ignorant girlhood, Leila’s favorite dessert. She’d liked the way light passed into the Jell-O and picked out the resident fruits. Running away on a boat with a man to save whales wasn’t something any actual person, certainly not any middle-aged woman with two children and an estranged husband, did. Running away on a boat with a man to save whales was the sort of thing a highly privileged, self-indulgent, insufferably youthful sort of person did. Anyone who did something like this was a person Leila envied and loathed. “Did you ask your wife if she thought I was the whale mother?” she asked challengingly. He couldn’t possibly be here, tall, lean, brown, ludicrously capable, standing on a storybook boat on the mirrorlike sea on a paradisal day in an island chain just offshore of the sunset, offering to transform her existence. “I did, the day I met you. Actually, I texted her, because her service is so shitty in Haiti. My text said, Maybe the whale mother isn’t a whale? Then she called the next day and we talked about it.” “Talked about it how?” Leila said, with the sense that she was driving him into a corner. “I told her about our connection.” After a moment he added, “Don’t pretend you don’t know what I mean.” “You told your wife about our connection?” Just like that, she had acknowledged it. “My wife and I opened our marriage a long time ago. It works well for us.” Was this something people did? Had Leila, running the rat race in New York for the past twenty years, entirely missed a revolution in social arrangements? “And did she—did she think I was the whale mother, or not?” This was cowardly and evasive; now it was Leila who was cornered. “She thought you’d come to me for a reason. Whether or not you were the whale mother, we were taking a wait-and-see attitude. We’ll know when we need to.” She hadn’t meant for her laughter to sound so derisive. “I’ve never known when I need to. I’m not sure I believe people can.” Lance turned away from her for so long she thought he might be receiving Morse code from the shore. He was apparently thinking. His profile was extremely unusual, like shale roughly hacked with a hatchet. Despite the severity of the outline there was something boyish about his face in profile that was maybe the absence of judgment. He seemed genuinely puzzled by what she had said. “Most people are at a total loss when there’s nothing important to do,” he said finally. “We’re not supposed to be totally idle and cared for—even kids shouldn’t be totally idle and cared for. It makes them depressed. I think your problem is that you’re punishing yourself for the completely normal feeling of wanting something important to do.” Before she left, they exchanged numbers, and then—as had so many of the women at the retreat upon first meeting her, as if there were no more mundane salutation—he embraced her. But he was so much taller—so much larger overall—than those women. His body blotted the sun. Her cheek, pressed to his ribs, was indented by the mallet of his heart. She wondered if this was his resting pulse or if his heart was agitated. She couldn’t tell. “There’s no obligation,” he clarified as he released her. “Only come if you want to.” “I’ll text either way.” “You don’t even have to do that. If you’re here tomorrow, you’re here.” It was all up to her, then, as she knew it must be. At dinner that night the other women were delighted with her fraudulent story of having gone to the wooden-boat festival just because it had piqued her interest. So celebratory were they of her little excursion that she understood how obvious her floundering had been to them, yet she wasn’t embarrassed. Something had changed in her on the trip back. Their praise bounced against her like blows off a drum—she felt taut and resonant and dominating. After dinner she slipped off to the field where she’d found she could get a clear signal. It was past ten at home—the boys would be in bed, but it would be better to have his entire attention. He said, irrelevantly, “Where are all those women you’re supposed to be retreating with?” “You think they’d take your side? Is that really how smug you are?” “Leila, if you run off on a boat with some man, you will lose custody of your kids. Do you hear what I’m saying?” She couldn’t even listen to him, his knee-jerk condescension. Into her silence he added, “You’re having an episode.” “You’re having an episode,” Leila replied automatically. It was such a mistake to have called. “I’m not having an episode,” he said with the same infuriating composure. “I’m making tuna salad for the kids’ lunches tomorrow, I’m going over Dashiell’s math, I’m ordering all the shit Aidan needs for his science-fair project, and I’m waiting to switch laundry into the dryer.” “As if you’re a hero for doing it! Who did it for the ten years before you left me?” “Go to sleep, please. Enjoy your retreat. Try to make use of it.” Screaming Fuck you! into the phone would only bring the retreat women fluttering into the field. Lost would be her brief moment of triumph at dinner. Lost would be that sensation, so novel, that she knew what she wanted, that there was nothing more simple to know. is the author of five novels, most recently Trust Exercise, which received the 2019 National Book Award.

        "story": "That night at the window, looking out at the street full of snow, big flakes falling through the streetlight, I listened to what Anna was saying. She was speaking of a man named Karl. We both knew him as a casual acquaintance—thin and lanky like Ichabod Crane, with long hair—operating a restaurant down in the village whimsically called the Gist Mill, with wood paneling, a large painting of an old gristmill on a river on one wall, tin ceilings, and a row of teller cages from its previous life as a bank. Karl used to run along the river, starting at his apartment in town and turning back about two miles down the path. He had been going through the divorce—this was a couple of years ago, of course, Anna said—and was trying to run through his pain. As you probably know, rumor has it that his wife had left him for a product designer, a guy who designed toothpaste tubes, product containers. Anna paused, as if to let that rumor rest between us, and I saw in my mind’s eye one of the newer toothpaste tube designs, shorter and stubbier than the long tubes of my youth. It seemed important that Karl’s wife had run off with a man who designed everyday products, whereas her husband had spent his evenings behind the bar, or at the maître d’ station, moving from guest to guest, touching shoulders (he was big on that) as he leaned down to chat, smiling and keeping his diners happy, running back to the kitchen to check on the cook and, in the late evening, when everyone was gone, staying to close up, making sure everything was tidy, clean. Then sometimes—I knew because, coming home late at night, driving through our dark town, I would see him there—he would sit alone at his restaurant bar, nursing a drink with all of the lights off except the dim ones he left on until dawn. So, Anna was saying, he was going through that horrible divorce, battling in the courts over custody of Ethan and all of that, and he was running along the path in the park late in the morning and stopped at the end to catch his breath, and he sat down. (At the window, we both imagined, I imagine, the spot in the woods, with the old stone structure that had served as a bathhouse years ago when folks came up from the city to enjoy a day in the country. You looked at the remains of that stone building, just an outline of the foundation, and felt the intense geographical and psychological shifts that had taken place when the automobile and parkways made a tripup the river feel too close, not far enough from the city.) Anyway, Karl sat down and began meditating, following his breath as it moved in and out of his body, clearing his mind, brushing his thoughts gently away, Anna said—pausing to gaze out the window—and then when he opened his eyes everything was clear. He said that to me, Anna said. We bumped into each other at Coffee Klatch last fall, and he sat down and began spilling his guts. I hardly knew him, but he told me about how he loves that sensation of opening his eyes after meditating, when everything is suddenly in focus, sharp and new. In this case, the river and the leaves on the trees and, across the river, Croton. When he opened his eyes he saw, through a break in the trees, something red out in the water. A red dot, he said, she said. He stood up—I’m imagining this part, Anna admitted—and watched the red dot until it grew—he said materialized—into the shape of a red kayak moving toward him from the middle of the river. Something about the way it moved—it was still too far out to see clearly—or its speed, something captured and kept his attention, or perhaps he was still in a meditative state and simply felt compelled to make the kayak part of his process. Anyway, what’s important is that he kept an eye on it as it slowly closed in on the shore, coming closer, and then he decided to walk down to the shoreline—the tide was out, I assume, Anna added—and he got down to the sand and watched as it got closer and closer. “A Canoe Trip” (detail), by Leandro Katz © The artist. Courtesy Henrique Faria, New York City Now do you want to hear the weird part? she said. (We were still at the window, looking out, watching a car move slowly down the street, pushing through the snow and slush. She had moved closer to me. I looked into her deep brown eyes and watched as she hooked a strand of hair behind her ears. Yes, give me the weird part, I said.) Okay, at this point, before going on with his story, Karl interrupted himself and made a huge deal out of telling me that his wife was horrifically afraid of water, didn’t know how to swim, and was even afraid to go aboard boats and had refused, one summer, to get on the ferry to Martha’s Vineyard. He told me a story about how she had to be sedated, taken on deck in a wheelchair, and kept asleep until just before they were docking in Oak Bluffs. (Can you imagine that? she said, and I said, Yes, I can imagine it.) So you can probably guess what’s coming, she said, and I said, No, I can’t guess, I have no idea, and at that point Anna moved a little closer, sipped her drink, smiled, and said, So when this red dot, this kayak got close enough, he saw it was being paddled by someone who looked a lot like Debbie, his ex-wife. At first he thought: Wow that kind of looks like Debbie. But when she got even closer, he saw that it was Debbie, and seeing this freaked him out and he ran back up the path and into the trees. He told me he went back up into the trees. There she was, his wife, who was scared of water, in a kayak. We stood quietly for a moment sipping our drinks and staring out the window at the snow, the black trees scratching the snow-clouded sky. I’m sure we were both imagining Karl’s ex, Debbie, and her straight blond hair, and her eyes—set unusually wide in her face—a washed-out blue with threads of white like an old pair of jeans. Then Anna went on with the story: Karl stayed back in the trees and watched as she came ashore, unstrapping herself, getting out, putting her legs in the water, pulling the boat onto the sand, standing next to it for a minute, looking up into the trees and then turning back to the water, crouching down, spreading her feet out a bit (Karl said that), putting her hands on her knees, closing her eyes, and going into what seemed to be a meditative state for a few minutes, stretching her arms straight out toward the water. In the trees, Karl was totally freaked out, remembering the many times she had refused to walk along the shore, to get close to where the waves were breaking, and a particular time when Ethan, at Coast Guard Beach on Cape Cod, waded too far out, his little legs swept out from under him, and, frozen in fear, unable to go into the water, she had screamed for a lifeguard to come to assist her. They had talked often about this fear of water, Karl explained, and had traced it to an origination point, I guess you’d call it, Anna said, all the way to her days as a little kid in Madison, Wisconsin, sailing with her parents on Lake Mendota, zeroing in on one particular afternoon when a sudden gale came out of the blue and her father didn’t ease the sail, or whatever you fucking call it (Karl said, she said), and the boat went over; or maybe the fact that her sister had nearly drowned in a similar incident, years later, sailing in a race off the Yucatán Peninsula. He recalled how for a few months after Ethan was born she refused to bathe, or shower, and her fear of water seemed to be—and he admitted that it was just a theory she got from a therapist—amplified as part of her postpartum depression, a desire to dry herself up after all that womb moistness (he used that exact, weird phrase, Anna said, using her palm to wipe a bit of frost off the window). Oh, and her water had broken when she was in the supermarket. (He told me that, Anna said.) She was at the Stop & Shop, at the cashier, when it broke. Anyway, he stood in the trees and watched while she finished meditating, if that’s what she was doing, got up and stretched, working her neck from side to side and then, holding the hull of the kayak, wading into the water and splashing her legs to get the sand off, and then, carefully, using the paddle to establish balance, she got back in the kayak and began to paddle out again. At that point Karl panicked and shouted to her from the trees, saying Hey, or Hey you, or something, and she paddled around and began to start back to the shore, and when she got close enough he walked down the path to the waterline and they had a brutal argument that went on for fifteen minutes (he said that, fifteen), shouting at each other and weeping. He wouldn’t tell me what they fought about, said they were both crying, but he admitted that he did say, near the end of the argument: Who the fuck are you? What the fuck are you doing out on the river? And Debbie said, I’m enjoying water sport, that’s what I’m fucking doing, and then she turned and began paddling furiously, and he watched until she was a red dot again, far out in the middle of the river, and then he sat on the shore and continued watching as the current drove the dot north, out of sight where the river turns. (We continued to look out the window. There were a few guests behind me—I’d used a similar scene, I thought, in a short story—the shush–shush of the cocktail shaker, the sound of Andy the filmmaker talking about his documentary about Neil Young. Neil let him hold his guitar, Old Blue, or Old Roy, whatever he calls the thing, he was saying, his voice booming over the din.) Weird, I said. That’s a weird story. So first he told you about her fear of water, and then he continued the story and told you about seeing her from the shore? Well, actually, I’m gonna have to explain something, she said, lifting her glass to her lips, tapping it to get an ice cube to slide into her beautiful mouth. You haven’t heard the twist yet. I have to give you the punch line. Give me the twist. Here’s the twist. When the kids were little and I was on leave from the firm, I was going insane with boredom, so I started swimming at the Y in the afternoons, doing laps, and there was a woman who always swam with me, usually in the next lane, and she was this amazing swimmer, I mean she would lap me again and again, working those amazing shoulders that were like a yoke, just huge, and one afternoon after I finished I took a shower and then got in the sauna. I was in there for a few minutes and then she came and joined me and we sat and didn’t say anything for a while and then she turned and we started talking and she told me she was married to the guy who runs the Gist Mill, and I said, Hey, yeah, Karl, and she said, Yeah, and we talked a bit and I got around to joking about how she laps me and she explained that years ago at the University of California she made the Olympic team, was on the secondary squad, or whatever they call it, and from that point on, when we swam together, we ended up in the sauna talking. Anyway, we became close, you know, in the way you do with someone in the sauna after working out, talking about kids, about A.D.D., about the school board, the P.T.A., and the town planning stuff, and I remember we talked about the Ferber method—she was trying to get Ethan to start sleeping on his own, I remember that, Anna said. She was letting him cry, counting the minutes. Then you’d increase the minutes and the crying would keep going. She told me Karl freaked out, tore a few pages out of the Ferber book. The kid cried for two hours and they huddled out in the hall, barely able to stand it, but eventually the kid fell asleep on his own but then started this weird thing of not wanting them around at all at bedtime, no tucking in or any of that. But before Ferberizing the kid—that’s what she called it, saying, We had to Ferberize the kid—before that he was coming into bed with them and they were going crazy, and here’s the thing that I remembered after Karl told me his story. I remembered that she had mentioned once, in the sauna, that she liked to kayak in the mornings. She got up at the crack of dawn and kayaked along the shore while Karl and the baby were asleep. I remember because she told me that once the kid had been Ferberized she had a chance to sneak out and kayak. She used that word, sneak. I remember that. As we stood at the window, someone was laughing loudly behind us, deep snorts and guffaws, and someone else turned the music up, Bob Dylan snarling and choking his way through “Here Comes Santa Claus.” Okay, so why didn’t you interrupt him in the Coffee Klatch and say something like, Hey, I thought Debbie loved to swim, something like that? I said, and she said, I don’t know, perhaps it says something about my personality that I didn’t interrupt him, that I was so intrigued—I mean he was practically sobbing into his coffee—that he seemed to be making shit up, or perhaps he really thought she was afraid of water. Perhaps she hid her love of swimming and water from him. She paused and we both nodded, looking out at the snow, and said, Yeah, yeah, at this idea. Maybe she snuck off to the pool while he slept late in the morning, or past noon into early afternoon, and faked a fear of water at the beach to get out of the fucking tedium of taking care of the kid, or maybe it began as her way of not dealing with those horrible few months after the baby was born, the jet-lag exhaustion, the nails-on-a-chalkboard of the crying baby, maybe this fear was originally fake and then overcame her and became real, something like that. We turned around and, still talking, went to the kitchen to get another drink, and then we went back to the window. Perhaps Karl just had to bullshit his way through his pain, one of us said, and then, in a joking manner, we agreed that the version I’d come up with was the best: this fear of water was something she conjured up to manipulate Karl, some manifestation of a deeper problem in their marriage, arriving out of the long afternoons of tedium and the loss of your sense of self that comes from being with a child all day—and now I see how strange it was that we both agreed that this perverse version was the one we liked the best: betrayal and deception on the part of Debbie instead of Karl being in a weird place, mourning his loss, making up bullshit to explain himself. Now, to be honest, I think maybe Debbie really did fake a fear of water and Karl, from his point of view, was being truthful about everything he said in the story he told Anna at the coffee shop, and I even think, now, after all this time has passed, that somehow both of us at the window that night were foreseeing—or having a prophetic vision, or something like that—that Karl would, as soon as spring arrived and the ice along the shore melted, attempt to swim across the river to Croton, digging in with his stroke as the current in the middle of the river drew him north until, presumably, he ran out of steam, or got hypothermia, and let go—and he was taken, or rather his body rode the tide, all the way past Bear Mountain, to Cold Spring. I still think about that story. Not the beginning or the end, not the sense that I had—the perplexity—when I held the entire thing, but that time at the window just before Anna filled me in on the second part, told me the twist about the swimming and the Y and all of that. She had restrained herself from telling me that part up front. She could have told me her side of the story first, giving me the pool and the swimming and then the sauna and then getting to Karl’s story at Coffee Klatch second, putting an emphasis on how strange he was that day in the coffee shop, and her inability to interrupt him, to say, Hey, wait, I thought Debbie loved the water. Looking back now I remember more than anything the feeling I had as we stood at the window that there was some elegiac beauty in the scene, however delusional it might have been, of visionary Karl as he finished meditating and opened his eyes to the bright reality of the world he was in—no matter how horrible he felt, after the court battles, the alimony, the fight over Ethan and the house and his restaurant—to spot the red dot. Why can’t we simply honor his befuddled, mind-blown bewilderment? The strange way the world can turn inside out? The majesty of his wife’s phobia! Stop. Leave it right there, I wish I’d said to Anna. Leave it pure mystery. I wish I’d turned from her and walked back to the kitchen to get another drink, where maybe I would’ve been drawn into a conversation with someone else, letting the part about the pool and swimming remain unspoken. I wish my wife, Sharon, had come up to me right then—she was sitting with her drink, chatting up Bruce, ignoring me because we had fought on the way to the party about a late car payment, and I know if she’d come in to refresh my drink she might’ve caught me at the window with Anna, detected some illicit conspiratorial erotic energy in our postures. Better yet, I wish Karl had been at that party that night so I could’ve buttonholed him into a long conversation about something, music, anything, and maybe somehow, just by hanging out with him and talking about his failed marriage, changed some small aspect of his life, something tiny but enough to butterfly-effect his fate in some other direction, just as I often wish that I had gone, when I was younger, when I had the opportunity to attend the funeral of my good friend’s father in St. Louis, where I would’ve also been with the writer, my friend’s other best friend, and if I’d gone, and I know this is a preposterous, egotistic thing to imagine, but I still do it, maybe we would’ve bonded and become close friends and maybe, just maybe, I would’ve done something to change his own fate. The town showed up en masse for Karl’s memorial. It wasn’t a head-shaker, the fact that he tried to swim across the river. He’d talked about swimming the river—people confirmed that when they got up to ruminate. His chef, a young man with a goatee, said Karl was a good swimmer and a hardcore runner. A few years ago he had participated in a river challenge for charity, making the swim from Beacon to Newburgh, a narrower part of the river, to raise money for heart disease, so it wasn’t such a shock that he gave it a shot on his own, his prep cook explained. His business partner, Bruce, spoke of his love of the restaurant, his kindness, his ability to balance his duties of serving his guests with running an efficient operation, and then, lowering his voice, he spoke of Karl’s love of the Hudson River, his support of Riverkeeper, an organization dedicated to cleaning up the water. Then someone named Anna Carthright, extremely old, unfolding her body into a standing position, her fist around the end of a cane, wobbled her way slowly to the microphone and, leaning down, in a husky, smoky voice—startlingly strong—told a story about him as a teenager growing up in Yonkers above his father’s shoe repair shop, and the way he liked to stand with his father at the tooling bench, watching him at work, and, yes, he had been a fantastic high school swimmer, winning the state championship three years in a row. Then she began to weep in that sour way of the aged—consumed, it seemed, with a glut of old memories. Many got up and spoke, each one taking a turn at filling in the pieces, talking about his wit—who else would come up with the Gist Mill as a name? The Gist Mill, “where you go to get the gist of good food,” one of the early ads in the local paper exclaimed. At the end, walking quickly to the front, Debbie, in a short black dress over her shoulders—yes, wide, really wide, swimmer’s shoulders—and her hair, brilliantly blond, brittle from the chlorine, got up to read from a poem Karl had loved by Wallace Stevens, about a blue guitar, and then Ned Patterson came to the front of the church and played his trombone, an original piece he’d written in honor of Karl, based on another Stevens poem about a jug, or a jar, or something in the hills of Kentucky, or perhaps it was Tennessee, and when he was finished—not a dry eye in the house, as they say—everyone went out of the church and stood in the blinding sun, blinking and shaking heads as if amazed that the clear, beautiful day existed, the way I imagined Karl had shaken his head and blinked in disbelief after he meditated in the woods that day, catching sight of that red dot in the water, watching as it materialized into his wife. That afternoon we gathered at the funeral parlor for the viewing, signing the book, pretending to gaze down at his body, avoiding it, really, many of us just glancing—the long face, the powdery cheeks, the purplish lips—and then some of us headed outside to smoke, to talk about his restaurant, his ability to make us feel at home, the cozy nature of the Gist on a snowy winter night, his ability to hire and hold on to great bartenders, his subtle wit, how much he meant to the town, this and that, smoking second cigarettes, glancing back at the door, avoiding going back in because it would mean navigating the various clusters of family members, older friends from college. We stayed out as long as we could, watching a few latecomers come up the walk and enter while a few others came out, walked in the opposite direction, drove away. Gradually the conversation moved to the other big topic at hand: the death of our town’s most famous and beloved figure, the film director—who had been a good friend of Karl’s and even put him in a bit part in one of his films, the one that won an Academy Award—and how the director had somehow avoided being a snob, kept a casual involvement with the town while still maintaining a gravity field (someone said) around him, and then someone laughed and said: Hell yeah he had a fucking gravity field, no fucking doubt—and financed local art shows and as an anonymous but obvious donor built the new wing on the library. Somehow that got us talking about the second-most-famous town member, who owned a house on the river and drummed, was the drummer for the biggest band in the world, or at least the band that claimed it was the biggest in the world and probably was, although the guys in the band were a bit old, threadbare, retreading (someone said) their old sounds, having a so-called comeback every few years. I stood there smoking my third cigarette and resisted telling the story of how I had met the drummer one afternoon, walking the dog on Broadway, noticing him as he came in my direction holding his little boy’s hand, and they stopped to pet the dog and I said hello and told him I particularly liked his work on that side project, the country singer’s album, a comment I’d had at the ready for such a chance encounter, and instead of being pleased to hear it, to know that I actually recognized his accomplishments outside his super huge band, he gave me a gruff reply, with an Irish lilt, the words indiscernible, really, and without saying another word, with his kid in tow, he walked away, making me consider, for the rest of that afternoon, the nature of that kind of fame, how it formed a field around you, nobody really responding to you as a human but rather to something else, something that formed around their sense of you, something like that, or maybe the other way around, who knows, and when I was thinking about that—on the porch of the funeral home, smoking that third cigarette—I thought about Karl, how he had taken a firm, human form as one of our local notables, kind and witty without being too close, sort of a middle ground, known and yet still somehow unknown, and how that made the mystery of his story, and his wife’s story, and the fear of water or no fear of water, all the more believable because it could be slotted right into the somewhat fuzzy nature of his identity as it presented itself to the town, or to me at least, and how the famous drummer, known for being the one guy in the band who didn’t take any shit, didn’t really like the fame game, always in the shadow of the lead singer, who was a blowhard but still seemed like a man who cared about the world, was unable to be like Karl, could not find the middle ground between complete anonymity and stardom in our little town, something like that. And I thought about how he had looked at me that day, his face much older than I expected, just before he turned without saying so long, or goodbye, or have a nice day, and walked back through the electric gate at his house, which opened with a very faint buzzing sound and then, still buzzing, slid shut while my dog, who had started barking when he turned and began walking away, barked and barked and barked at the drummer and his little boy and then, after they had disappeared, continued barking at the gate itself, as if it were alive, and I supposed it was alive in his eyes, having moved of its own accord, and then I stood holding the leash and let him bark a while longer—he had an extremely loud bark for such a little dog—as I continued thinking about the nature of fame, how you must feel the sense that people have built the story around you before they really know you, making them untrustworthy, perhaps, a normal feeling for anyone in a small town but amplified somehow, so that the entire world, from China to Brazil to Poland to Spain would seem like a small town to you, everyone knowing your face and name, or at least, in his case, the die-hard fans knowing it—whereas for the lead singer everyone in the fucking world knew him, almost everyone, and his nickname was his name now. And on the porch I thought how with Anna’s help I had projected onto Karl various stories, knowing only a little bit of hearsay about his life, I thought, watching another pair of mourners leave, a short man with a hat on, a real hat, a derby, and bowed legs, and his wife, stout—maybe the correct word is now large-boned—walking about a yard behind him, and then my wife came out and silently told me, with her glance, that I had failed in my duties by coming out with the smokers, and by smoking myself, and I gave her a glance that, I hoped, said, Thank you for doing it for me, because I could assume that she had gone the extra mile in politeness with the family members. Almost a year after the funeral I had a dream that I was eating at the Gist Mill and Karl was there, with a small hand towel over his shoulder, near the back, watching his diners, keeping things going, rushing over to pepper a dish or check in with someone, reaching out, touching shoulders and bowing down and leaning back—his long, lean form elegant, his beard trimmed short and neat—and he came to our table and asked us how things were and we talked briefly about the new bridge that was being constructed across the Tappan Zee, how quickly they were building it, and then we talked about the dredging that had to be done to build the new bridge, and he might’ve mentioned something about Pete Seeger, or something about the need to clean up the site upriver, or maybe it was something about the tides running high this year, or the ice that had built up during the last deep freeze, and then he went off to tend to his other guests. He was the same Karl, maybe a little bit of grief around the corners of his eyes, something like that, but basically, as far as I could tell when I woke up, the same man, same person. But then a few nights later, I had another dream, one that felt like a sequel to the previous dream. In that dream I was coming home late from the city on a snowy winter night, the streets dead and the town shut down, and I saw him alone at the bar, same towel over his shoulder, holding a glass. I pulled over and parked and tapped on the window with one knuckle, and he looked up and waved me in and I said, Is it too late, you closed? And he said, No, come in, man, let me get you something, and he poured me a huge glass of something golden, some dream-drink, and we sat and talked for a while. This time, aware that I was aware that I was in the kind of dream in which you’re aware that you’re in a dream, I tried to nudge the conversation around to his wife, to the water, to that afternoon along the path in the state park. I asked him how he was doing. I told him what a tragedy it was that he had died. I asked him how it had been out in the water. He told me it wasn’t suicide, not exactly, unless you believed that Karl Menninger shit. And yes, he said, I’m named after Karl Menninger, the shrink. Then he told me how he had a wet suit and his tide charts and had it figured for the ebb but then he realized too late, far out in the water, maybe a mile out, with a cold wintry sky overhead—a front was heading down from Albany but he figured he had it timed right—that he had used last year’s tide chart, and when he got out into the middle of the river he could feel the fingers (weird dream language) of current pulling him, a big hand. And right then my dream lost all shape, turned surreal, and he was telling me to calm down because I was in the water, too. But I was much younger in the dream, just a kid in an old orange canvas life jacket, and it was clear that we were both going to drown together because fingers appeared beneath the surface, real dream fingers, and then I saw my teenage car floating past, the old Nova with its sandblasted roof full of hailstone dents, pocked as if from acne, and I realized in that flat-out indescribable dream-logic flash that those were God’s fingers, and we had conspired together in our own delusional self-deception. Oh well, suffice it to say there was a floatation device, the pocked roof of my old car, Karl’s face, the river, the current, finger things, the sky, a sense of being in the dream, God’s fingers, and Karl next to me with a fiendish grin on his face. Karl’s body had washed ashore in Cold Spring. That wasn’t a dream. Sharon and I went up there a few years after some trouble in our marriage to meet with what we referred to as a financial adviser, parking up the road and walking down the hill—some stores open for business, others shut down, boarded up—with the Hudson at the bottom and Storm King Mountain looming beautifully in the dusky summer twilight. We went through the tunnel under the railroad tracks and stood there in the little park, listened to the sound of distant gunfire from the West Point firing range booming off the mountain and back to us and looked at the river and, right then, I had to resist telling her the story Anna told me that night, because to even mention her name would’ve been painful, and I’d have to explain right there, with the river flowing swiftly, that I wish she had come to the window that night, interrupted Anna’s story, cut us off right then so that I wouldn’t know the entire thing but also because then, well, then one thing would not have led to another. I looked at the water and thought: she’d understand, actually, if I told her the entire thing—even the dream, all of it—but then I’d have to be precise and clear about everything and, with the beautiful scene before us, with the warmth that came from the sweet night air, a mix of the tidal salt and creosote, it just didn’t seem worth it. We were both thinking—I’m sure—about Karl and his restaurant and the tragedy of his swim in the river. We were both thinking, I’m sure, about the dangerous currents that ran all the way up the estuary, dug deep by retreating glaciers, or volcanic activity, a ridge meeting the sea so that the sea and the river battled each other twice a day, if you want to look at it that way, or, better yet, lovingly embraced each other in a mutual, moon-drawn embrace, running silently through the darkness of night and in the heat of day past all human folly and abject sadness we create when we’re here, as it would when we were long gone—just bones and earth—as it had before we were here, I thought. Then I turned and took her hand, or she took mine, I’m not sure now, and we walked back under the tracks—the wet dripping of water, the smell dank—and back into town, searching for a cozy little place to eat, anticipating that sensation we’d get, only a few miles away from home, of being on an adventure together in a strange place with strangers all around, and the polite silence of those who do not know who you are. is the author of five story collections, including, most recently, Instructions for a Funeral.

        "story": "He had his stick that was used mostly to point at your head if your head wasn’t held up proudly. I still like that man—Holger! He had been an orphan! He came up to me once because there was something about how I was moving my feet that wasn’t according to the regulations or his expectations. The room was a short wide room with a short wide window with plenty of artificial light. On Holger’s say-so, the girls stayed seated and we all crossed the room to ask them to dance and to bow. I have never doubted the logic of it, but I was surprised I acted swiftly with my hair neatly water-combed, in my suit and my tie. I liked her—the girl I asked—and she had bread breath from rye bread, my favorite, and my elbow needed to be up, my hand placed between her waist and her shoulder blades. And when the music stopped, I took her back to her spot like a little man of the world, with no reason to complain. I returned to the other side of the room to wait until we moved one place over to ask the next girl in the row to dance. To this day, I keep up my ambition to meet guidelines. Although tonight, to get to where my wife stood, I was probably stepping too quickly. Had I made an irregular gesture—unforeseen?—because she pulled away quite thoroughly. She said, “You always latch on to me when I am about to yawn, and now I can’t do it!” And she lifted her chin, covered her mouth, and tried again. But after failing, she had that expression I know so well—that she is suffering, as she should, and for a better reason than I ever do. Was she afraid of me? Why isn’t she afraid of me? To a great extent there is great value in her sour face, still capable of awing me. Because she was dressed for a gala, her mouth was painted red. Her eyes were lined in black, her hair curled. What all this reminds me of is a wise saying: “Do not use the contents of an unlabeled bottle—even if you think you remember what it contains.” One side of her face then seemed about to smile, as if she was also staring at me, smiling at me behind my back, yet nothing was funny. I do not try to argue, reason, or fight back with a person in this state, which is so similar a state to brave, balanced, grand. inserted into the rest of her My arm is scaly and thin and my bracelet has oblong links of fake gold. It’s not real. It’s not real, and the doctor had his admonitions for us that we kept trying to put into Willy’s words or into mine on the walk home. Oh, what the human body can go and do on its own because there was something really awry with Willy. We followed a group of children who were also being strongly advised. And there was no varying of the force or the pitch of the voice that was shouting at them: Don’t ever eat the berries! I encircled Willy’s waist with my arm, but I often brood over whether I am partial enough to my husband who is very ill. The sun was briefly out and in the gilded city air, we thought to make a stop at the Cherry Door Thrift Shop where we bought a small but heavy chest—handcrafted. “Do you really want that?” the clerk asked. She took more pride in some practical tables that were light enough to carry. On foot, with the help of a store hand, we got the chest home in the rain. It was a ticklish scene, decorated by toothy-edged clouds overhead, and the chest has made little atmospheric change in the world of our home. Doctor Boondas had prescribed glyceryl trinitrate for Willy. And his nurse had waved at us and shut the door behind him when Willy went in. And then another woman cast herself forward through the door toward me. It looked as if her head and her neck had been carved separately and then inserted into the rest of her. She had a grave aspect and the gaze of a person in a trance. “I had one!” she shouted at me, as she pointed at and took up my wrist. She fingered my faux good-luck piece, from which I count on powerful emanations to produce certain happy-enough results. She said, “I gave mine to the church.” And my ornament is common enough. I’d say one like it can be found in North America in almost every treasures-and-trash locale. I also collect shells. I found a plaster figurine of a Greek goddess to stand in the way of our books, to keep them from falling on their faces on the bookshelf. I did recently give away a full-zip fleece jacket and a coffeepot percolator. Soon Willy will go. I used to think he afforded protection. In the case of Willy—much like a dragon with a down-to-earth aura—he was especially feared and recommended. My regard for my plaster Artemis is deeply implanted, and she can bring on a blush when I see her—a hot jealous feeling for her thin neck, heavy hairstyle, and for the glass spheres inside of her eye sockets. master of the blast That’s how bright the sky was! A woman’s lilac dress somehow picked up greenish hues as she was chewing and chewing one biteful. And was she even hungry as she squeezed her hands together under her chin, so that her knuckles pulsed?—as she kept on with her snapping and gouging and delving into what was both pliable and crisp. It was not easily done—and then a boy who was with her sneezed. “God bless you!” I said. “Why?” the boy asked. Another one of his sneezes followed that expanded and rolled but drew no salute. The chewer had stopped her chewing and thanked the server for offering her more coffee—coffee that I could see had strength, unexpected darkness. And with a deep, indwelling smile, the server said, “Perfect.” Then I coughed abruptly and the cough was a bugle-like three-parter. There followed some barely audible drumming on a tabletop from a man who was enthusiastically engaged with the syncopations. The woman told her boy, “Well then, I want you—” as the boy cowered and as the sound of my own tearing, with my teeth, into my toast, interfered with my hearing any more of his mother’s scolding. It is such a challenge to express exuberances in disrupted areas. I folded my restaurant tab in half, tore it at the center of the fold. I held it like a cigarette, then I rolled the two ends over my fingers and put my mouth to it and I blew. This didn’t work. I was out of practice, but it needs to be flimsy paper, because then when the air strikes across the torn slot, the paper starts to vibrate in the airstream and it makes a big noise. There! Then I did it! It’s not always one hundred percent. she’ll love me for it There is a part of the sky at nightfall that she really enjoys, too, and the woman’s late father can be seen never suffering from the waist up, hanging young and bland above a sideboard in a portrait. Just the same, this woman is bollixed by an emotional problem and it’s as if she smacks her head against the wall until blood spurts out and the color red is also vivid in the street where she lives—where an equestrian statue has been painted a pretty shade of it by vandals. You see the woman’s health began to give way because of that emotional problem. It doesn’t help that she eats heavily salted, dyed meat along with her eggs and irresponsible is not the right word for this. The place in which she sleeps poorly is in the room across the passage from where she eats and we have the ability to get close to her gross movements, her ordinary life and to pick at her critically. During lonely months the woman thought, I touched him! And we often observe this type of pining among primitive types. I saw her grieving, but I didn’t think the world of her. Where is her capacity for being a sly tease? For being playful? Mind you, the portrait of her father features good flesh-painting and the technique was drawn from the methods of others—feathery touches. What if the woman is dignified when she speaks?—and what if I am generous about her behind her back by suggesting that her structure—her long back muscles, her buttocks, shoulder blades, all of it—amount to a great domestic landmark?—gracious and picturesque—that may stand up against a headwind while she overlooks the broad expanse of a river. She’ll love me for it. Will do. what is given with pleasure and received with admiration? For her, sometimes the conjugation was a haphazard intertwining, with loose swings—other times more planned and positive. All right. Good. Why? Because now she is a grown woman and she has had a lot of intercourse with her husband, except that she has ended the marriage. And things nearby her may prompt a recollection or tell a story. On her stove top, for example, an iron pot she owns has been scoured and scooped out even more than she has. And its sides meet its bottom in a wide curve to provide for efficient stirring and this pot offers her a hole of significance that is well filled with bubbles of water and with light when the telephone rings. “Ms. Joy M.Willums?” the caller says. “I need to get in touch with Ms.Joy M.Willums. Are you Ms.Joy M.Willums?” She answers no and also balks at the gruel in the offing that had been headed for the hot pot. Outside she goes alongside the river to hear horns blowing and a bell ringing and she is drawn forward—but by what? It could be the sun appearing, as if it were a lank strand of brass wire coiling. It lights her way, and both the sky and the river are wavy and blue and she meets a friend by chance whose hair is newly auburn. That’s right. Her friend DeeDee Luck has topped herself off, so to speak, in a color resembling the onset of a fire and her friend is accompanied by her two small sons. Since they are all on the ditch side of the river, the bigger boy kneels down and throws up a handful of black mud. “Oh, Tyler!” cries his mother, when Tyler sits down in the ooze. “You always get your way!” The boy says, “Ye-e-e-e! I get my way,” and he is slapping at the soil and then Tyler extends the range of his antics. He obtains an easy kind of rhythm that well expresses the isolation of individual people. is the author of nine books, including The Collected Stories of Diane Williams, which is out this fall in paperback.

        "story": "I was in Midtown, sitting by a dry fountain, making a list of all the men I’d slept with since my last checkup—doctor’s orders. Afterward, I would head downtown and wait for Quimby at the bar, where there were only alcoholics and the graveyard shift this early. I’d just left the United Nations after a Friday morning session—likely my last. The agenda had included resolutions about a worldwide ban on plastic bags, condemnation of a Slobodan Miloševic statue, sanctions on Israel, and a truth and reconciliation commission in El Salvador. Except for the proclamation opposing the war criminal’s marble replica, everything was thwarted by the United States and a small contingent of its allies. None of this should have surprised me. Some version of these outcomes had been repeating weekly since World War II. I’d been working at the U.N. for a little over a year, and in that short time I’d had sex with the South Korean ambassador, the spokesman for the Swedish Mission, an Irish delegate, a Russian interpreter, an Iraqi translator, the assistant to the deputy ambassador from El Salvador, an Armenian envoy, the chief of staff for the Ukrainian prime minister, the vice presidents of Suriname and the Gambia, a cultural attaché from Poland, the special assistant to the special assistant to the Saudi ambassador, the nephew of the ruling party’s general secretary of Laos, a distant cousin of Castro, a film director from Mauritania, countless low-level staffers, a few guides, a half-dozen tourists, and Brad. “General Assembly II, United Nations, New York, USA,” by Jason Oddy © The artist Courtesy ElliottHalls Gallery, Amsterdam William Mycroft Quimby. The other students called him Billy. To me, he was Quimby (sometimes Quim)—the Ph.D. student who led my section of Comparative Government 245 (“Cuba Isn’t Finland, but Neither Is Finland Cuba”). Quimby was a smart guy who came across as even smarter because his English was high-register and thickly accented. And he was authentically Irish, unlike the third-generation Catholics I’d grown up with, whose ethnic pride consisted of tattoos of shamrocks and pots of gold along their necks and ankles. In phenotypic ways, he reminded me of my friends’ dads back home. He had dark hair (also thick) and a knotted face—Quimby was an academic, but he could have been a middleweight boxer, a boxer who gave me attention I wasn’t accustomed to. He also had a gorgeous, uncircumcised cock (it, too, thick) that made me want to know him better, but we drew the line at office hours. I hadn’t seen Quimby for almost twenty years when I ran into him at the Raw Hole—a gay bar, if you have to ask—one Friday about fifteen months ago. The red-bulb lighting made it difficult to be certain, but when he walked past the first time, I knew I knew him. The second time, I knew it was from college. The third time, a rush of blood inspirited me. “Quim!” I shouted. He stared at me momentarily, then a moment longer. “Wednesday afternoons,” I said. “Your basement office . . . ‘NAFTA, Schmafta, can you hear the world’s lafta?’ . . . ” “Charles in Charge? Wow. I barely recognized you with that mustache. How in the heck are you?” Before I could respond, Quimby set his pint down on the small table and joined me. “It’s been ages,” he said with a glassy stare. “What a truly magnificent surprise, Charles in Charge. Fine as ever, you are.” Carlitos is my given name. “Carlitos Doritos,” the other kids used to call me—one more undesirable way in which I stood out. In middle school, I began demanding that my family address me as Alex P. Keaton, but my dad kept mispronouncing it as “Alice,” which my siblings seized upon, so I settled on Charles in Charge. This was the title of a sitcom that starred Scott Baio as a young heartthrob who nannies three children while going to school and juggling a prolific love life. I was drawn to the show because of Charles’s (Baio’s) relationship with his best friend, Buddy (Willie Aames), a one-dimensional, albeit oddly sagacious, buffoon. Their camaraderie and affection were genuine and subtle in ways that none of their other acting ever was. The slapstick humor struck me as either repressed or coded desire. Frankly, I didn’t understand how the show made it to network television. “Carlitos?” Sister Susan called out. But instead of “Present,” I responded, “Charles in Charge!” “Is that Mexican?” she asked, peering up from the attendance sheet. “No,” I said, “it’s syndicated.” “Are you visiting?” I asked Quimby. “No, I live in Brooklyn. Near one of the bridges,” he explained, looking even more like the dads of my youth than he had twenty years earlier. “I work for the Irish mission to the U.N.,” he continued. “I’m engaged. He’s Italian. Divides his time between here and Rome—also government work. How about you?” “I’m in Brooklyn, too. Single, recently single. Actually, always single. I’m at the Health Department.” I explained to Quimby that after college I’d taken a stab at an acting career—some theater, a few clown parties, and a couple of television commercials. In fact, one toilet-paper ad paid for all of graduate school. I studied public health, specifically the effects of hierarchies: Does pecking order predict health outcomes? (Well, yes.) “Fascinating,” he said, and reached across the table to squeeze my forearm. Quimby and I exchanged numbers and had sex once, for old times’ sake, a few weeks later. Afterward, he asked me if I was looking for a new job. “The U.N. relies heavily on health data. You could find work rather easily,” he explained. I wasn’t unhappy at the Health Department, but I found the idea of the U.N. intriguing and romantic, like Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews in The English Patient, so I followed up. My official position was Health Researcher (Category IV) for the United Nations Human Rights Council (H.R.C.). In brief, I was a summarizer tasked with taking complicated research and reducing it to talking points—bulleted lists, fourteen-point font. Vis-à-vis the H.R.C., most of the nearly two hundred member states wanted me to build a bulwark of data against my own country. Anything to get the U.S. to come to its senses was the popular sentiment throughout the U.N. At first, I felt strange about working for the world and not my country, like the orphan athletes who carry the nondescript flag at the opening ceremony of the Olympics. But then Quimby explained that we had no choice. “Convincing the U.S. to do no harm is the full-time job of many, many people,” he said. “What did you think happened here?” The truth was I hadn’t given it much thought. Also true: it didn’t matter. My questionable influence-peddling didn’t influence shit. In a short period of time, I learned that the United States was immune to easily interpretable, commonsense data on everything—pollution, tuberculosis, birth control, breastfeeding, war, rape, white phosphorus, blue phosphorus, red phosphorus, lithium, P.T.S.D., G.M.O.s, slavery, winged migration, lions, tigers, polar bears, grizzly bears, panda bears, capital punishment, corporal punishment, spanking, poverty, drug decriminalization, incarceration, labor unions, cooperative business structures, racist mascots, climate change, Puerto Rico, Yemen, Syria, Flint, Michigan, women, children, wheelchairs, factory farms, bees, whales, sharks, daylight saving time, roman numerals, centimeters, condoms, coal, cockfighting, horse betting, dog racing, doping, wealth redistribution, mass transit, the I.M.F., CIA, I.D.F., MI5, MI6, TNT, snap bracelets, Pez dispensers, Banksy. It didn’t matter what it was. If the Human Rights Council (or Cuba) advocated one way, the U.S. went the other. I kept at it anyway. This was, after all, what I was paid to do. And a few times, human rights did line up with U.S. interests. AIDS initiatives, for example, were well funded as long as they didn’t include mention of sex work, harm reduction, or anal sex. Also popular: eagles and pharmaceuticals. Charles in Charge, take this report to the top was my primary directive. “The top” meant the penthouse floor, where the U.S. set up its operations. No other member state had its own floor, but since the U.S. had threatened to leave so many times, and since it gave more money to the U.N. than any other state—although it gave less in proportion to its GDP than most wealthy nations and several of the poor ones—the international community, in an effort to placate, offered the U.S. the most prime of its already circumscribed real estate. Never mind that the U.S. was 146th in terms of population density, 83rd in peacekeeper contributions, and that what it did contribute was always late, less than what it had promised, and came with a bad attitude. The penthouse elevator, a refurbished contraption with 1970s maroon carpeting and a bright, L.E.D. control panel, made only two stops (top and bottom), slowly. On the way up, the trip lasted eight minutes; the reverse was six—something about gravity, I was told. The silver lining to all of this elevator travel was that most of the sex I had in the first six months retained an air of privacy. The remainder transpired in the middle stall of the nineteenth-floor bathroom, not far from the hall of U Thant busts. I wasn’t alone in slipping skins at the nexus of global diplomacy. The U.N. functioned essentially as a sex club with simultaneous translation. And although everyone kept a shroud of decorum about it, it was frequent, widespread, and usually peaked after voting days. The musty aroma didn’t supplant the fetor of failure and futility that hung in the air and along the corridors, like inert gases or the ghosts of the League of Nations. But it certainly helped. Betwixt the sex, I worked. On Mondays, I gathered and synthesized the relevant research pertaining to a Friday vote. Tuesdays, I delivered the one-pager to the penthouse. Wednesdays, I dropped off a shorter version in a larger font. On Thursdays, but sometimes on Friday mornings, I received a “We don’t understand” memo, occasionally with a list of questions. Often, however, the sheet was blank but for the header (“Huh?”) and footer (“God Bless America”). In a place where the United States had so much power, hope was naïve. “This is the netherworld between possibility and delusion, but we continue to give it our all,” said my supervisor, a soft-spoken Tamil and former resistance fighter who wore pantsuits, shiny scarves, and flats. Jaya rarely interfered with my work, only occasionally suggesting that I add one more bullet point or that I indent my sub-lists. She also never left her office and always brought her lunch from home. If there was a warrior in her, it lay in repose beneath a passive, perfunctory veneer. The Sri Lankan government appointed her to the Human Rights Council during a temporary ceasefire, as a form of exile, Quimby explained. “She hasn’t a passport—not an uncommon predicament here.” Each morning, upon entering the main building, my first stop was the second floor, where all of us were required to leave our phones in personalized lead boxes that fit seamlessly into a floor-to-ceiling wall unit composed of thousands of cubbies. The unintended side effect of being phoneless was that cruising happened the old-fashioned way. No dating apps or text messages or semicolons. Just eye contact. Corridors and bathrooms in the U.N. were how all streets and bathrooms used to be—namely, gay and closeted. The dalliances were old-fashioned, too. Discretion, after all, wasn’t only the mode at the U.N.; it was the guiding principle, for both policy-making and fornication. Over time, I inferred that divulging anything might be grounds for termination. “Yes, it’s wise to be circumspect,” Quimby said, after another day of deflating No votes and a few pints. “On the other hand,” he added, with raised eyebrows and a subtle break in his posture, “some people have found innovative ways to use these encounters to their benefit.” “Do you mean blackmail?” Quimby scanned the main room of the Raw Hole for anyone who might be “earwigging,” as he put it. (In addition to being a warren of workplace inappropriateness, the U.N. also served as an asylum of sorts for people facing all manner of discrimination in their home countries.) “Not blackmail,” he said, leaning in close, “but yes, blackmail.” Quimby must have seen straight through my eyes into the place where the gears had begun to turn, because immediately he switched into a severe tone. “Take heed, Charles in Charge. Once you’re caught in the web, it is near impossible to become unstuck.” I nodded. Quimby drank half of his beer in one go. Then he patted down the drops that had spilled onto his shirt. “Marco’s in town,” he said. “You wanna come back to ours for a roll in the hay?” “Another time,” I said. I had had a quickie with a Senegalese tourist before leaving work. It was common knowledge that Saudi Arabia wanted to maintain the practice of beheadings. And since the king and his princes had been, for years, disbursing low-interest gold ingots to the world’s most unsuccessful businessmen, no one on the Security Council, neither permanent nor temporary members (except for Venezuela, Vietnam, and Uruguay), was eager to support an upcoming resolution calling for a worldwide ban. “You will have to give this report more oomph,” said Jaya. Apart from the usual mix of statistics and boilerplate pith, I included evidence of how the practice of beheadings was applied discriminatorily in the few countries in the world where it remained common practice. I also appended proof of its barbarity—testimonies of loved ones, pictures, verses from the Bible, and a copy of Braveheart. Somewhat surprisingly, no one responded; there wasn’t even a fax from the Americans. The Saudis, like the Israelis, Egyptians, Russians, and Liechtensteiners, were known for playing rough. Upset them even a little and an onslaught of press releases questioning the very legitimacy of the U.N. appeared swiftly, which in the case of Israel was uniquely frustrating because the U.N. had legitimized its existence in the first place. (Periodically, a cartoon drawing of the Israeli ambassador pulling the rug out from under himself circulated in the General Assembly.) If I were going to do anything more to give this resolution a chance, I’d need to be cautious. Quimby lent me his camera—a slender, 007-like device that he kept taped under his desk. I used it to record myself with Mo, the special assistant to the special assistant to Faisal, the Saudi ambassador. Mo was a small fry, physically and figuratively, but he was the closest I ever got to Faisal—the spoiled, third-born son of a very powerful businessman who’d been incapable of putting out the fires his son habitually started back home. (In addition to refuge and asylum, the U.N. was a rehabilitation camp for those with too much privilege to face consequences.) After arranging the camera on a shelf of the Dag Hammarskjöld Library—“the Old Jag-off Hammar Library,” Quimby called it—I made my way to the halal cafeteria on the thirteenth floor, where Mo tended to have lunch on Wednesdays. From there, it wasn’t difficult to lure him into the stacks. The hard part was making sure we stayed in the camera’s field of vision. Mo kept whipping me around in overwrought gestures that suggested he wanted desperately to be good at something he hadn’t practiced enough. Ironically, it was Mo’s aversion to being decapitated that ultimately led to Saudi Arabia’s support for the resolution against beheadings. “I need to show you something,” I said to him the day after the encounter in the library. “Yes, yes, of course. Shall we go back to Jag Hammar?” he asked. But I pulled us into a nearby office-supply closet instead. When I held up the camera, he began to cry. I was completely unprepared for his reaction. Usually stoic, Mo cried several viscous tears that hung from his chin for a small eternity before free-falling toward his wing tips. I felt shitty but didn’t know how to recant. “Just kidding” seemed a foolish and insufficient way forward. It didn’t matter. Before I could say anything more, he wiped his face with his tie, crossed his arms, and disappeared. Rumor has it that Faisal rejected Mo’s request for reconsideration on the resolution and threatened to have him sent home, but instead of folding, Mo threatened back with a video of his own—one he’d been keeping for just such an occasion. Faisal grabbed Mo by his tie and leaned into his face, screaming, spittle flying. “My pet tiger will eat your spleen alive for this,” he said. That Friday, Faisal lobbied for an amendment to the day’s agenda so that he could speak in advance of the Security Council vote. Saudi Arabia would not oppose the resolution. The surprising reversal led to a brief recess, during which Australia and the United States regrouped with their allies and also decided to support the resolution. “Congratulations,” Quimby said at happy hour the evening of the vote. “Now, lie low. Don’t get greedy.” A few days later, I had a romp in the Kofi Annan Memorial Lounge with Robin, the spokesperson for the Swedish Mission. Afterward, he shepherded through a resolution against Iranian sanctions. Next, it was Wojciech, a cultural attaché from Poland, who, after an elevator ride, helped to maneuver a condemnation of the Brazilian president’s fascist rhetoric. Then came Bob, the king of Thailand’s valet plenipotentiary. His real name was Apichatpong, but Bob was easier in this country, he told me. At his insistence, we went to his office. The room had no windows, and my repeated attempts at turning on the lights were met with resistance. Eventually, he pulled away and buttoned up his shirt. “I know what you are trying to do,” he said, as he relooped his belt. “That will not work with me. The king cares nothing of what I do. He cares nothing about anything. Try instead to ask me directly for what you need.” Bob was a slight man with a shaved head, faint mustache, and rimless eyeglasses. His sincerity embarrassed me. I zipped up my pants and walked toward the door. “Charles in Charge, your way is not sustainable,” he called out. After that, I took a break from sex altogether. I focused instead on writing reports, which proved easy because everyone seemed to be nursing cold sores in those cold months. I’d been battling outbreaks for years, but I didn’t want to risk coinfection with another strain, or a superinfection. Iwas on my third gin martini and ninth olive when the stool next to mine crashed to the floor. I turned to find a contorted figure trying to pick up his mess. It was Brad. Red-eyed, upper-middle-class, youth-adjacent Brad. Drunk but full of vim, vigor, and, as the girthy silhouette in his pants suggested, virility. That night, he fell asleep during sex, and I wasn’t able to wake him. The following morning, I fried eggs and bacon and toasted week-old sourdough. It’s what I would have made anyway, but since I had a companion, I prepared twice as much. I’d half-expected him to play the role of straight man with amnesia, but he was polite and, generally, quite genial. He was also the first U.N. co-worker I’d ever brought home. Over several cups of coffee, I learned that Brad was a trust-fund kid with an almost undetectable lisp and half an M.B.A. On the surface, he reminded me of all the guys in college who’d never given me the time of day. His father had been a vice president at I.B.M. in its heyday, and his grandfather had been a well-known confidant of Ronald Reagan, as well as Nancy’s paramour throughout most of the Cold War. In fact, Brad appeared in the annual extended-family photographs of several prominent political families. These connections had marked his life—a warm welcome into Yale, then Harvard, then out of Harvard, and, finally, into the U.N. I’d known him simply as one of the quiet Americans who waited at the penthouse elevator bank to receive my reports. Once, maybe twice, I’d flirted with him, but he’d been unreceptive, and, to my credit, I hadn’t insisted. A younger version of myself would have set aside dignity to pursue him—rejections from white men have always come across as institutional or systemic, serving only to invigorate me. But my adult self met his disinterest with my own. Despite our height and age disparities—four inches and ten years—Brad and I bonded to each other like a small magnet to a refrigerator door. It happened quickly, too. I can’t quite articulate how or why, but after a week his toothbrush and retainer appeared in my medicine cabinet. As an unspoken rule, Brad and I didn’t acknowledge each other at work, but whenever I delivered a report to the Americans, he made sure to intercept it. The doors would open, he’d pop his head inside, and we’d embrace until the elevator started beeping. Those few, wet kisses constituted all of the contact we had outside of my apartment. At his request, we also avoided arriving at or leaving the U.N. at the same time, and we never discussed work. I preferred it that way. Better was to make dinner with him, interrupt dinner preparations to have sex, continue dinner-making, eat while watching reruns of Designing Women—a show he’d never heard of, which led to an awkward moment in the third week, when we were both reminded of our difference in age—and have sex again. Through it all, there was no mention of trade relations or species on the verge of extinction or tsunami relief or the official song of the World Cup. Our interactions were the most basic: eat, fuck, watch sitcoms. And I questioned none of it, including our eventual shift into the middle place between lust and love. No-man’s-land was an unfamiliar, classless, color-blind waiting room so comfortable that I didn’t care what was next. Until the sixth week. That’s when I noticed reticence. Reticence in the kitchen. Reticence on the couch. Reticence in the elevator. “Do you want to call it quits?” I asked. “What? No! Why?” “Oh. Well, you’ve been distant or uneasy lately.” “I’m sorry,” he said, and folded himself onto the couch like an origami giraffe, leaving nary an opening between us. “It’s work. Just work stuff. Nothing to do with you. I promise.” Then he kissed my neck and unbuttoned my shirt. Afterward, both of us were famished but neither wanted to cook. We ordered dinner from the new pan-everywhere vegan restaurant that he’d been wanting to visit, and before going to bed we watched an episode of The Good Place, which he’d been advocating for all week. The following night, his typical, upbeat confidence was again adagio. I wasn’t as worried as I’d been when I’d thought his mood had something to do with me, but I wanted him back to the way he had been nonetheless. Up to then, we’d done well by our rule of never discussing work, which should not have been easy, since our livelihoods were in some way tied to most current events as well as all of history. “Do you want to talk about it? The thing at work, I mean.” “Not really.” “Might make you feel better.” After a bit more prodding, Brad opened up. “You see, the deputy rep is putting a lot of pressure on me to secure opposition for an upcoming resolution. And it’s more difficult than I expected. To complicate matters, a colleague let it slip that I’m on some sort of probation. Apparently, I’ve been underperforming.” “Is it because of me—us?” “No, no. I don’t think so. I’ve just been trying to do too much. I was hoping to move from communications into something legislative. But now I have to get my act together. Without this job, it’s back to Bunkport for me.” “Which resolution is it? The one that’s giving you trouble.” “The, uh—the one calling for a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate war crimes in El Salvador.” “I know it well.” He nodded. “You know, my family is from El Salvador.” He nodded again, and I felt my face turn and tighten, screwlike. “It’s more complicated than you think,” he said. “This may surprise you, but we plan to get behind the resolution. The problem is that China signaled support for the T-and-R commission first, and we can’t go on record agreeing with China about a human-rights issue. That would set a bad precedent.” Maybe I’d been working at the U.N. too long, but in that moment, his reasoning made perfect sense. During dinner, Brad remained quiet. He spent more time dragging his spaghetti around the plate than eating. Afterward, he loaded the dishwasher and washed the pots and lids that didn’t fit—something he did often and that felt anomalous to who he was and where he came from. I mean, white men certainly wash dishes, but not white men who have family homes in Kennebunkport and who call Kennebunkport “Bunkport.” And never pots and lids. When we were done cleaning up, Brad didn’t want to watch any television, preferring instead to continue reading a tome of an LBJ biography in bed. I was left feeling like an unwanted guest in my own home, or the child of working-class parents around the first of the month, or a drunk person in a library. Finally, I broke the silence. “Is there something I can do to help?” Brad set the gigantic book down over his bare abdomen. “I don’t want to mix you up in all this.” “So there is something?” “I don’t know. You see, China only agreed to support the resolution after El Salvador cut its diplomatic ties with Taiwan. We believe that if El Salvador were, in some way, to re-recognize Taiwan’s existence before Friday’s vote—even a minor overture—China would recant its support for the resolution, leaving us free to back it.” I sat on the edge of the bed and thought about it for a minute. “I don’t understand. Why the sudden concern for human rights?” “That’s not fair. We are for human rights.” I didn’t respond, but Brad must have read my face. “I can see why an outsider would think that,” he said. “I’m not an outsider.” “You know what I mean.” I knew what he meant, but I also thought it was possible that he could have meant several things at once. “Charles in Charge, we care about El Salvador. It’s an ally.” “Nothing else?” “Well”—Brad sat upright—“there’s a Central American trade agreement coming up. We plan to ask El Salvador to rename its largest garment-factory city ‘U.S.A.’ If the Salvadorans agree, the majority of textiles and apparel coming out of the country will read—” “Let me guess: ‘Made in U.S.A.’ ” Brad shrugged. “But the clothes would still be made in El Salvador.” “People just want to see it on the label,” he said. “They’re not going to investigate past that—we’re getting ahead of ourselves anyway. What’s important is that we support El Salvador’s resolution now, so that they come through for us later. A win for retail and for human rights.” Brad had come up onto his knees and was resting irresistibly on his heels, an impish grin across his face. The bedsheet had slid down onto the bed. Apart from the portrait of LBJ covering his johnson, he was naked. “You overestimate my position and abilities if you think I can get El Salvador to change its stance on Taiwan.” “I don’t have any doubts about your abilities,” Brad said before Lyndon Baines Johnson went facedown onto the bed. The center-left party in El Salvador had campaigned on promises of de-privatizing water, magical realism, and truth and reconciliation. After winning the election, the new president signed bills that nationalized half of the drinking-water supply and ratified the CONCAMAGIA, a Latin American treaty granting every participatory nation unfettered access to literary fabulism, but he was dragging his feet on T&R. In the Nineties, the first U.N.-sanctioned investigation into the atrocities of the country’s civil war placed the preponderance of blame on the right-wing government and its allies. The Salvadoran government at the time was composed of conservative factions who disregarded the findings and never again mentioned truth or reconciliation. Although the left was now in power, it, too, feared what an investigation might uncover, especially with so many former revolutionaries in the government, including the new president. A trap door, vis-à-vis Taiwan, would be an appealing option. “Oh, mate. Getting into bed with the Americans is a terrible idea. They’re all cute hoors,” Quimby said, something he was wont to say of anyone he considered unsavory. “Besides, T-and-R has been sought for years by the survivors of the war. If it falls apart now . . . ” Quimby raised his pint and his eyebrows. Politically speaking, Quimby was a mellower version of the young man I recalled from my college days, the one who wrote his dissertation about the Irish struggle for northern independence as a J’Accuse of the British monarchy (“Anglican? How about Angliwon’t! Fuck the king, the queen, and the entire chessboard”). And still, he never passed up an opportunity to openly disparage the descendants of his own countrymen here, whom he accused of desecrating their anticolonialist histories: “Is there anything more despicable than a New York City cop with an Irish surname?” he’d say whenever we walked past a police officer. “And what about your family, Charles in Charge?” Quimby set the empty glass down, revealing a light foam mustache. “Have you thought of them?” The political congruencies between El Salvador and Ireland had always interested Quimby. After our office-hour romps in college, he’d ask me to recount the few family tales I knew because he said they reminded him of the stories his mother used to tell him. Lore about aunts, uncles, and cousins who’d worn wigs and prosthetic noses, baked codes and coordinates into pupusas, and trained in armed combat in jungles and university basements. People I’d never met, some of whom were still alive and, frankly, needed—if not urgently, then sooner rather than later—truth and reconciliation. Much of the country did. And while I may not have felt much allegiance to these stories and characters, actively betraying them seemed unnecessary. “Don’t view it that way,” Brad said on my couch, on the eve of the vote. “Besides, it’s a moot point. Thanks to you, we’re free to support El Salvador.” Brad had been right about China. Once Taiwan reentered the picture, the Chinese balked. I was the one who had made sure Taiwan reentered the picture. Hipólito, El Salvador’s assistant to the deputy ambassador, tended to cruise near the Boutros Boutros-Ghali Gallery on the twenty-fourth floor. As a place of art, it was unremarkable—a room full of empty plinths and lesser works by well-known painters that had been found in the rubble of war zones—but at the end of the mustard-colored corridor, there was a single-occupancy restroom that was rarely occupied. The guilt of cheating on Brad left me impotent at first, but after a few minutes, and despite the cold tile, I was able to enjoy myself. When we were done, Hipólito sat bare-assed on the sink, running his knuckly fingers through his hair. “Uff. Esome hacía falta,” he said before exhaling forcefully. “I also needed that,” I replied, as I handed him his pants. “Oh, and just a heads-up, Australia is going to propose an emergency amendment to the resolution, one that requires immediate extradition to the International Criminal Court for anyone found to have aided or abetted war crimes during the civil war. I heard they want to go hard after the current administration so that the right wing wins the next election.” “¿Qué?” Hipólito hopped off the sink, scrambled for his shoes, and ran off. By lunchtime, the Salvadorans were abuzz. The following morning, the president of El Salvador, who had been scheduled to appear at the U.N. for Friday’s vote, canceled his visit. This signaled to everyone that something was awry. And when the Salvadoran mission announced that the president would be visiting Taiwan instead, everyone assumed the resolution would be dead on arrival. “You tested positive for gonorrhea. You’re asymptomatic, but you’re still a carrier,” said Dr. Pangilinan over the phone, on the morning of the vote. “Nothing to worry about, but refrain from sex for a week after you’ve completed your treatment,” he said. “And please notify all of your sexual partners since your last exam.” I hadn’t had gonorrhea since college. “Down with your drawers,” said Quimby, who kept a stash of ceftriaxone and azithromycin in his desk. The former was an injection; the latter, pills. “Shit, Quim, there have been dozens of men since my last checkup, and I don’t have any of their phone numbers. I might be responsible for a global epidemic.” “That’s nothing. Half the U.N. died in the early Eighties,” he said. “But don’t fret, everyone here is on PrEP, and they know to keep a supply of these.” Quimby held up the bottle of zithro and an empty syringe. “Feel bad for the tourists.” I nodded along, like a poorly trained public-health worker. “Are you going downstairs for the session? Your vote should be coming up soon.” “No. I’m going to watch from the Ban Ki-moon Room,” I said, as I zipped up. When I arrived at the viewing deck, groups of second-tier aides and elementary-school students were making their way into the plexiglass-encased chambers above the Security Council. Just outside was Jaya, her hand over her chin, softly squeezing her own face. I’d never before seen her away from her office. “This one has slipped from our hands,” she said without looking at me. “I fear for El Salvador’s future.” “It will happen today. I’m certain of it,” I responded. “Have you not heard the murmurs in the corridors?” “Gossip. That’s all.” Jaya looked at me askance. “We almost had a win,” she said. “Almost.” “Worst case, we can prepare for another vote in a few months,” I said, hoping to lighten her mood. “Tell me, Charles in Charge, during your brief tenure here, have you ever seen a motion fail and return for a vote? There has not been a landmine resolution since Princess Diana.” “Have some faith, Jaya.” “Faith?” Jaya gave a scornful shake of her head. “Faith is for the unseen. Am I not visible to you?” I nodded slowly, unsure if she’d used a double negative. “You know, Charles in Charge, many people come here looking inside of these walls for what they have never been able to find outside of them. You’re not the first.” Although I didn’t understand what Jaya meant, I continued nodding. She turned, as if to leave, but remained in place with her back to me. “Charles in Charge,” she whispered, “a piece of advice: you don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to, but don’t get in the fucking way either.” Then she marched away. The speaker system in the viewing room created an uncanny effect: everyone was living the experience while simultaneously listening to it over a radio. The agenda listed the vote on El Salvador as the fourth of five items. On the floor now was the second, a resolution opposing a statue of Slobodan Miloševic in Manila, part of the new Filipino president’s homage to his heroes. (He’d already erected tributes to Suharto, Mussolini, and Andrew Jackson.) The first vote of the day, a resolution banning plastic bags, failed 8–7. Australia, which had classified it as an environmental MUSE (a Matter of Utmost Security and Exigency), cast the deciding vote against itself. With the United States breathing down its neck, Australia argued that the resolution was poorly written and ultimately inefficient—never mind that Australia had written the text to begin with. In a rare win, the proclamation against the Miloševic statue passed 10–4, with one abstention, despite protestations from the Filipino envoy. “Spain and the United States made us this way!” he shouted. “And all of the airports here are named after warmongers!” Then there was a fifteen-minute recess. The third item was sanctions on Israel in response to its seemingly regular Friday massacres of Palestinians in Gaza. But no sooner had gavel hit table than Israel’s representative interrupted to argue that the measure didn’t clarify whether it included today. “Today, after all, is also a Friday,” he said. “If the resolution includes today, it is invalid because we have definitive proof that the I.D.F. has not fired upon anyone yet. And it is too early to assume that anything will happen later.” Before the delegates could respond, the U.S. representative offered a motion to table the resolution until the following Friday so that they could have time to gather information about this Friday. Without a single hand going up or down, the functionary announced that the motion had passed 14–1. Everyone, including the Israeli delegation, looked gobsmacked. A slow train of sighs, boos, and tsks gradually circled the hall and entered our enclosed aerie. Next was El Salvador. As the chamber reshuffled, I noticed Brad conferring with his delegation, a small coterie of faint pinstripes and one sienna skirt suit, most of whom were seated and balding. Whenever he bent over to speak to them, he pressed his tie against his midsection—the red one with white diagonal stripes that I had picked out that morning. The Americans nodded with bobbleheaded fervor. Brad then walked over to the Australian delegation and went through a similar protocol. He shook their hands before walking up the aisle and disappearing to a level beneath me. The U.S. put forth the motion to support the Salvadoran resolution. Venezuela, Vietnam, Uruguay, Sweden, Burkina Faso, the U.K., and the U.S. voted in favor, just as we had foreseen. Opposition arose expectedly from China, Russia, France, Guatemala, Poland, Kazakhstan, and Uganda. Australia was the last to cast its vote, and when its ambassador raised his hand he said, “No.” Then he added, “Without prejudice.” “The resolution fails by a vote of eight to seven,” it was announced. “We will take a short recess and resume the agenda on the hour.” I leaned forward and pressed both hands against the plexiglass. The crowd of people behind me trickled out of the room. Half of them were nonplussed in a traditional English manner; the other half were North American nonplussed; all of them hummed the “Marseillaise.” When I thought the room had cleared, the sound of faux throat-clearing entered. “Charles in Charge,” he said. “You—” “Let me explain.” “I don’t understand. The Australians always do what you want them to. How could—” “They did do what we wanted them to.” “But—you—” Brad’s eyes widened, like those of an underfed lemur. His body, however, was a steel beam on an ancient burial ground—a far cry from the gentle giraffe he’d been on my couch, in my kitchen, and in the elevator. “Be realistic,” he said. “Did you think the United States was going to open itself up to being investigated? El Salvador’s civil war was essentially of our making.” Brad’s point was completely logical. Still, I was angry. “You didn’t have to do all of this. You have the power to veto whatever you want.” “Veto too much and you get a reputation.” “Huh?” “The world’s changing. We can’t risk another state actor becoming the moral compass. You prefer Russia? China? No one wants that. Playing the game is the only way.” “Game?” “Don’t be coy. Why don’t we ask Mo about playing games? Oh, right, he’s no longer here. In fact, he’s no longer anywhere. He had the distinction of being Saudi Arabia’s last official beheading.” (I’d heard the rumor about Mo’s death, but nothing had been confirmed.) “Perspective, Charles in Charge. That’s what you need. You’re alive. I’m alive. No harm from this. You’ve lived to fight another day.” My ears went warm. Something, possibly my heart, was expanding in my throat. Somewhere in my chest was my stomach. “But I—weren’t you—I mean . . . We all suck, Brad, but you’re the worst.” His gaze turned downward. Above us was a sketchlike painting of Earth, a graph of gilded longitudes and latitudes: an outlined world with no sign of life. “I guess this means I’m not going to see you later?” I continued to stare at the empty globe, silent. “Okay, have it your way. See you around, Charles in Charge.” “Yes, this is hell after all.” I thought I heard him chuckle in response, but I wasn’t certain because by that point the sounds of the outside had come in through the open door. Quimby was waiting for me at my desk. He’d come to give his condolences about El Salvador. “Don’t get down on yourself. I’ve been there before,” he said. “We all have. You have no idea how much the future of this world is shaped by a few shags.” I nodded. “But didn’t I tell you never to trust the emissary of an empire?” “You did.” Quimby patted my shoulder. “Lesson learned,” he said. “Let it go, Charles—” “You know what? Don’t call me that. Call me Carlitos.” “Carlitos? Hmm. Carlitos. Better. Much better . . . Well, Carlitos, the Puerto Rico resolution will be up shortly.

        "story": "I couldn’t leave. I couldn’t get up—just couldn’t get up, couldn’t get up or leave. All day lying in that median, unable. Was this misery or joy? It’s happened to you, too, hasn’t it? A habit or phase, a marriage, a disease, children or drugs, money or debt—something you believed inescapable, something that had been going on for so long that you’d forgotten any and every step taken to lead your life here. What did you do? How did this happen? When you try to solve the crossword, someone keeps adding clues. It’s happened to us all. The impossible knowledge is the one we all want—the big why, the big how. Who among us won’t buy that lotto ticket? This is where stories come from and, believe me, there are only two kinds: one, naked lies, and two, pot holders, gas masks, condoms—something you must carefully place between yourself and a truth too dangerous to touch. A long time ago someone told me that it’s important to locate and deploy our own stories, because otherwise you’re stuck listening to everyone else tell theirs, or worse, someone convinces you of The Big One and you end up tithing 10percent of your income to an all-powerful and mostly loving corporation that does so much good and just a little evil, like protecting ordained child abusers from public scrutiny or jail time, but whoa there! Reel it back in, Bucko. Let’s not balance this checkbook just yet. Anyway, that’s what someone told me once. Illustration by Katherine Streeter My current paralysis seemed to have begun with a three-word question graffitied all over my neighborhood. Neat letters, white paint: who is she? It was on the back of a park bench, around a telephone pole, across a single brick of an apartment building, on the underside of many cans of beans, in every bathroom stall at the public library, and certainly it was elsewhere—places I hadn’t gone or couldn’t go. I began by passing this plea between my two redundant hands, but soon it was moving in my mind like a pinball trapped by ramps and tunnels and inertia, lights flashing, arbitrary numbers appearing on the little screen—who is she?—rattling around, racking up points, or, I don’t know, what’s the opposite of points? I didn’t seem to be accruing anything. And I was so tired. All the time, tired. Then I was crossing this—what is this? A boulevard? Sure. I was crossing this boulevard, crossing it right in the middle, at a place not meant for pedestrians—no crosswalk, no sidewalk, no walk-don’t-walk sign, nothing at all there to protect a body, and when I got to the grassy median between the northbound and southbound lanes, I could not find a reason to leave it. I lay down amid the sweet weeds, the windswept trash, a nice place for me. It was early—five or six on a Sunday—so almost nothing in the visible world was moving. Maybe gods and ghosts were getting ready for their day, sure, but no people, no cars. Still, I had all the company I needed, or perhaps it was all the company that I could handle, and what is the difference really? I lay on my back in perfect happiness and wondered: Who is she, who could she be, who was she, who might she have been or who could she have become? A lot of time passed; it will do that if you let it or if you forget to not let it. Cars began driving on either side of me and a few people would yell things from their windows as they passed. They’d ask, “Are you okay?” or “Is everything okay?” or “What happened?” Sometimes I would try to shout a reply, but none of their questions were specific enough to really merit an answer. If I turned my head one way I could see a hospital and if I turned my head the other way I was looking at the ocean or, rather, I was looking through a spartan beachside gymnasium toward the ocean. There was something oddly Soviet about those simple metal bars stuck in the concrete. It was such a utilitarian structure that I imagined it could have only been erected with a specific political agenda in mind. Yet the people pulling up on those pull-up bars seemed less like Communists than like the devout customers of a capitalist system that produces two hundred varieties of isolated protein powder. I watched them for a while and found it at once incredibly moving and incredibly sad—their tender efforts. It was difficult to witness and impossible to look away. The men were so armored with muscle that even shirtless they seemed to wear shirts, and the women wore oddments of spandex over each lump of pubis or tit. They all took turns rubbing oil on one another’s backs. They photographed one another and were photographed by one another. Three men jumped in synchrony into the air, to the ground, into the air again, and down, repeating infinitely. A woman in a high-legged one-piece did several pull-ups and screamed and I felt her fear. Another focused on improbable lunges, one leg held aloft, glutes both bulbous and flexed. It was an orgy of health, human strength taken to its promiscuous extreme. They all cheered for one another, all smiling, all yes-yesing, all you-can we-can yes-yes-you-can. They could all do all of it, and more and more. At some point every well-greased man and woman joined hands and faced my median to say, in unison, “Because we are so beautiful and because it is illegal to have sex in public and because we wish the world could see how beautiful we are when we have sexual relations with one another and because we all want to be respected citizens and, above all, parents and because none of us think of ourselves as pornographers and because we are sad that the world cannot watch us have sex with one another, because of this we have all taken a personal oath to our own health, and we have taken this very personal and private oath as publicly as possible, and so we will be here as often as we can, even more often than we can, and we will be here doing this, being seen doing this, being watched doing this and doing this to be watched doing it.” And I thought, Gosh, they really got right to the point, didn’t they? And I wish I knew how they could all agree so suddenly and make that statement together, but by the time the entirety and complexity of their shouted oath occurred to me, they had all reoccupied themselves with their personal betterments. It was just dusk when a large car with its lights flashing slowly pulled over beside the median. A woman got out from the driver’s side. She wore a helmet and a fluorescent vest with reflectors that flickered in the blinking headlights of her car. Beneath the vest, half the message of her T-shirt was obscured. It said something about The Female. something is female or the female is something. This was a time in which gender was the answer to every riddle, and it was either all-important or nonexistent, a point that academics and semi-academics and demi-academics were always tug-of-warring over, only sometimes realizing they were pulling the same side of the rope. But perhaps, I wondered, this woman in the Female shirt knew something about who she is or was, but before I could think to ask she’d set a circle of orange traffic cones around me. “Are you safe?” “I think so.” “Do you feel safe?” I didn’t know what to say. “I want you to know that there’s a man in my car over there,” she said, kneeling beside me and lowering her voice. “But don’t worry, he won’t come over here unless I tell him to. I have the situation under control.” She was nodding and looking down at me. A bird shat on one of the orange traffic cones and she looked at it with great despair. “There’s only so much that one person can do.” She lowered her voice to a volume appropriate for an admission of guilt and told me that the man in her car was her husband and he’s white on top of being cis and hetero, so they’d decided not to let him out of the house much anymore. Since she’d started pegging him, she said, he’d begun to understand the world better and he’d been having these personal revelations, quietly, to himself, while he cooked and cleaned and peeked out the window between split blinds. It was simply true that the very sight of him could be enough to send someone into a flashback, and did you know, she asked me, that nearly 70percent of American females with P.T.S.D.have a trigger associated with the smell of Old Spice? “I’m just telling you all this so you understand that we’re both safe here in this safe space.” She gestured to her traffic cones and offered me a helmet. I didn’t want a helmet. Did I want to talk? she asked. Anything I told her would be confidential, she promised, unless it needed to be reported to the authorities, in which case she would be compelled to do everything in her power to protect me and my safety. In a voice one might use with a tantruming child, she asked me how I got here, whether any violence had occurred, whether I’d been savagely left for dead on this boulevard median. For a moment I thought of telling her about who is she?, but then I found myself thinking about what happened before that graffiti took up all my attention, back when I was, I don’t know, I was—what was I? Regular? Something like that. Normal? I kept a nice home with a nice man. When we walked around together, the elderly were comforted and children felt safe. I know this because they told us so. Old men would lean over our restaurant tables and say, “After seeing you two I feel certain that life as I know it will continue after I’m gone,” and children I had never even seen before would sit next to us on the bus and confess to me their deep sense of security. There was always going to be a fresh sandwich in their backpacks as long as this man and I were together, holding up society, keeping everything clean and calm. And I thought back to the day I met him while we were both buying organic milk at a socially responsible grocery store, and about how he led me into a well-lit public area and, after reciting a trigger warning, read me an Emily Dickinson poem—the gun one, the one everyone knows—so I followed him home and spent several years waiting for him, a loaded gun, to fire. Instead I learned that two people can spend a long time together waiting for another person to show up, waiting for the part of the game show where someone comes out from behind door number three and the audience squeals and people instinctively cover their mouths and widen their eyes. No one knows why people cover their mouths at times like that. It is one of life’s great mysteries. Around year eight I started to get the feeling that this man was, perhaps, a copy of the thing and not the thing itself. Maybe his reading that Dickinson poem at the start was meant to be a warning. You know, some people get stalled in the obvious. There are times when a person has both an illness and the correct medicine in hand, but cannot take it. You must know what I mean. That feeling—that feeling where you both don’t know what to do, and know exactly what to do. For instance, I never wanted to be one of those people who started hanging around strangers until something untoward occurred, but then one day I was quivering on psilocybin and making out with my neighbor while listening to Dark Side of the Moon. How did it happen? I decided that since I never really got to be a teenager in that way, this experience was a kind of back taxes being paid decades too late. Then all the who is she? tags started showing up—Well, what was I supposed to do? Now I wonder if perhaps all this confusion is just the afterglow of that darling hallucinogenic alkaloid. I have come to love nature and all its natural things. Lying there in the median, I told a version of this story to the woman in the helmet and she began to cry. She told me that white men had to be stopped. I said I wasn’t entirely sure what she meant by that and she gave me a voter registration form and stacked all her traffic cones together and went back to her car, U-turning to the other side of the median and leaning out her open window with a finger pointed at me. “Listen! I’ve slept with too many white men in my life to be told that I have a problem with white men!” Then she went away. In the dark, someone from a homeless outreach program stopped by my place on the median, but when I told them I wasn’t homeless, just resting, they went away, taking their complimentary sack dinners with them. Again in my solitude, a fresh piece of horror set in: What if the she of the question was the me of my life? What if I was her? No. No, don’t let it be me, I begged myself. I don’t want to be her. I couldn’t bear to keep living if I’d been the bug under the rock of that joke. A young man from the beach gym unrolled an exercise mat beside me and laid himself down on it. Whatever you want to tell me, I thought, it’s too late. He didn’t tell me anything, just asked if I wanted to “do some abs” with him. By the look of him in the moonlight, there didn’t seem to be anything else he could do with his abs, but he began going at it—leg lifts and scissor kicks and swivels and twisties and other actions he announced by name, then performed with perfect form. Here he is, I thought, my last hope for something to happen in this story, my last hope for an explanation, an action, something, but when I looked at him nothing was missing and nothing was there. Wasn’t it true that someone or something needed to change? Wasn’t it true we needed to leave this weedy median for somewhere better? Not the gym. Not the ocean to drown in. Not the hospital, dead in our own hands. Somewhere else, some place that none of us can see from here. I cannot bear how quickly and slowly time moves. You must be familiar with this feeling, aren’t you? Tell me you are. I can’t bear to be without company these days. is the author of Certain American States, The Answers, and Nobody Is Ever Missing, all from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. She lives in Chicago.

        "story": "A Toyota HiAce with piebald paneling, singing suspension, and a reg from the last millennium rolled into the parking lot of the Swinford Gaels football club late on a Friday evening. The HiAce belonged to Rory Hughes, the eldest of the three brothers known as the Alps, and the Alps traveled everywhere together in it. The three stepped out and with a decisive slam of the van’s side door moved off across the moonscape of the parking lot in the order of their conceptions, Rory on point, the middle brother, Eustace, close behind, and the youngest, Bimbo, in dawdling tow. The Alps, weary after a week of work, did not speak. They listened to the chunked slippage of the gravel under their work boots. On the floodlit pitch a pheasant groomed itself beneath the sagging diagonals of the goalmouth netting. The night air was close and cloudless, sultry with the stink of the seasonal silage coming off the surrounding fields. Illustrations by Matthew Richardson Asleep almost on his feet, Bimbo noticed a light moving up in the sky. A shining point, minuscule as a star or a transatlantic plane, but moving far too nimbly and erratically to be either. Bimbo roused. He watched the point descend at an angle, shoot back up at ninety degrees, then stop and wobble in place. A spaceship, Bimbo fancifully thought, for the point’s motion, however clumsy, seemed purposeful. Then Bimbo noted the patch of land the pip of light was bobbing above and figured it out. “See that?” he said. “Hah?” grunted Eustace. “What I’m looking at,” said Bimbo. His older brothers turned to Bimbo, then faced back in the direction he was looking. “Which would be?” said Rory. “See,” said Bimbo, focusing his attention on the point. As if by telepathy the older two duly clocked the light. “What in the Christ is that when it’s at home,” said Rory. “It’s a drone,” said Bimbo. “Them acres over there belong to Marcus Landry, right? And I heard that man was intending to import half a dozen of those things in from the States, to keep track of his herds, is what it is.” “Drones,” said Rory. “Would you be well.” “He’s rakes of land and rakes of livestock but animals do be regularly going missing on him,” Bimbo said. “The surmise is some intrepid gangster is poaching them on him.” “That would be the surmise, alright,” said Rory. “Drones,” said Eustace. “Would you be well.” “Landry is a man of means,” said Rory. “Men of means are rarely right in the head.” “Surveillance,” said Bimbo. “I think it’s class.” The Alps were shortish men with massive arses and brutally capable forearms. They breathed coltishly through their noses and rolled their shoulders with a circumspect flourish whenever lasses crossed their path. They billed themselves as tradesmen, though between them had never acquired a qualification in any particular trade. What they did was try things at a competitive rate. They painted, wired, plumbed, tiled, but where they excelled was in the displacement of the earth: digging holes, filling holes back in. Holes of any circumference and depth. Holes were their forte. Bimbo had just turned thirty-seven, Rory and Eustace were coming up on fifty. The Alps still felt young in their souls, but it was the startled eyes, pouched necks, and capitulating hairlines of middle age that leered back at them from mirrors. They ate too much takeaway, slept fitfully, downed vats of Guinness every weekend. In addition to their remorseless lifestyles there were the disgraceful odds offered by their genes. The Alp family tree was a stump mutilated by cancer and coronaries. Few of their forebears had made it into their sixties, which meant the Alps’ days were probably almost over. The Alps carried this knowledge around with them. Because what else could they do but carry it? Fights happened and they got in them. The Alps were laconic and deprecating in company, but it was like a switch got switched. It was not true to say any of them had a temper, only that they possessed a reserve of a certain kind of energy. The Alps were built for punishment—they were not built to last. The Alps came through the clubhouse door to a mild effusion of hollers and hellos from the handful of patrons already ensconced. There was the teenage barman Mikey Reilly with his pink cheeks and sawdust crew cut. There was Softly Broughan, recently retired half forward for the county senior football team, dubbed Softly for his loping running style and ability to ghost between the opposition lines, who now managed his father’s haulage company out of Westport. Softly was a vivid dresser and was tonight arrayed in a baronial waistcoat with fobbed pocket watch, cornflower neckerchief, and champagne bomber jacket of distressed leather. On the arm of Softly was not his fiancée, the solicitor Stella McIlenden, but one of Stella’s younger sisters, Denise, a primary-school teacher and finalist in the 2014 Mayo Rose of Tralee pageant. The pensioner Peader Ginty was there, with a tank of purified oxygen snugged into the tartan trolley bag he was obliged to wheel around with him everywhere, and his scowling daughter Moira, herself in her fifties, in the narrow black clerical trousers she favored and the dark glasses she never took off on account of her chronic photophobia. “Anyone clap eyes on that peacock outside beyond the goals?” Bimbo asked. “I did not,” Softly said, “but in any case I’d wager that would very much be a pheasant you were looking at, Bimbo.” Bimbo looked Softly up and down. “You look like Kanye, kid,” Bimbo said. “Kid, I am Kanye,” Softly said. Rory and Eustace slid onto a pair of stools in front of the taps. “How’s the form, Mikey?” Rory asked. “The form remains legendary,” Mikey said, already working on their Guinness. “A round of cheese toasties as well,” Rory said. “We are running on fumes here.” “Onions and mustard?” Mikey said. “Load them beasts up,” Rory said. “And three packages of Tayto while you’re at it.” Mikey turned to the shelves behind him and the brothers regarded his neck, bright pink, savagely sunburned. “That’s an awful scalded neck you have on you there, Mikey,” Eustace said. “I was up on the roof of the mother’s house listening to an M.M.A.podcast this afternoon and didn’t I only fall asleep,” Mikey said. “Ah now,” Rory said. Bimbo remained on his feet. He paced around the lounge, brooded at the burgundy carpet with its pattern of custard-colored spades like the spades on playing cards, his hands dangling at his sides, limp as strangled game. He was antsy now because of the presence of Denise McIlenden. He could not remove her from his peripheral vision, nor did he want to. Her skin was an improbably deep and even brown and she was in jeans and heels and she smelled absolutely unreal. She was one of them ones who was already beautiful but troweled on the cosmetics anyway, and while there was a certain type of man who claimed he preferred natural-looking women, Bimbo did not see how you could mind either way. The Alps were not men comfortably acquainted with the carnal, but they had their intermittent yearnings. Bimbo had done three sides of the room and was coming up past Moira and her wheezing daddy. “What’s it at?” Moira said. “What’s what at?” “The peacock. The pheasant. What’s it at?” “Oh now, just existing,” Bimbo said. “Is that so,” she said. Moira had a big nose, scraggly hair, and a perpetually pursed mouth. She was inclined to the taciturn anyway but the dark glasses made her expressions completely unreadable. Bimbo suspected she played up the photophobia in order to maintain precisely this effect. There was always a hint of mocking in her voice and Bimbo had no time for her, really: she reminded him of the country singer Bob Dylan, and he had no time for Bob Dylan and his unpleasant singing neither. “And how are you, Peader?” he said to her father. Peader Ginty started. His face was bloated and yellow, the corners of his eyes sudsy with discharge. A nose cannula hooked over his ears fed him oxygen out of the tank nestled in his trolley bag. He was diabetic, he could barely walk because of his gout, and his heart was riddled with stents. He was just a big watery bag of imperiled organs, and the only parts of him that still worked worked because of ongoing medical interventions. Moira was stuck as his carer, and if she was even a tiny bit more hospitable in her demeanor, Bimbo would have felt sorry for her. “Oh, good now. Not bad now,” Peader wheezed. His breathing reminded Bimbo of the antiquated stove in his granny’s. “And yourself, Bimbo?” Peader asked. “Nothing worth complaining about.” “People who have nothing to complain about lack character,” Moira said. “Oh,” Bimbo said. “Is that true? Peader, do you reckon that’s true?” “What?” Peader said. “Go back to sleep,” Moira said. “I’m not sleepy,” Peader said. “Have you taken your pill, Daddy? You have to take your pill,” Moira said. “I do be always taking that pill. I never miss that pill,” Peader said. “Good man,” Bimbo said. “You tell her.” “Don’t be getting him worked up,” Moira said. “I do take them pills like clockwork,” Peader said. Bimbo sighed. He tilted his head back, squared his shoulders. Denise McIlenden was behind him. He could smell her watching him. “Peader,” Bimbo said. “I’ll race you round the parking lot. A single lap, full bore. Fella comes last owes the other ten bob.” “I’d leave you for dust, kid,” Peader said. “You would, too.” “Come over here and eat your toastie before I do,” ordered Rory. Bimbo looked his brothers’ way. Rory’s mouth was shiny with grease and Eustace had his face down almost on the plate, the pair savaging at their food with the shameless avidity of children. Bimbo came over, took his pint and crisps. “You don’t want that?” Rory asked. “Have at it.” “I will, so,” Rory said, transferring the toastie onto his plate. “Have you your Sky box fixed yet?” Eustace asked Mikey. “We do.” “Throw it on there.” Mikey picked the remote off a back shelf, turned on the TV angled above the bar, and began promptly flicking. “Tell me when,” Mikey said. “Please don’t go turning up the telly,” Softly said. “Why?” Bimbo said. “TV lowers the tone,” Softly said. “The tone?” Bimbo said. “Before you boys barreled in, we were sitting here in silence,” Softly said, “and it was an awful cultivated silence.” “I’d say it was,” Bimbo said. “And oh, do you know what else I saw out there?” “Aside from the peacock,” Moira said. “Pheasant,” Softly said. “You don’t know for sure I didn’t see a peacock,” Bimbo said. “I will put down any money it wasn’t a peacock,” Softly said. “They are related creatures, though,” Denise said, “so it’s not like either of you are far wrong.” “Thank you, Denise,” Bimbo said. He caught Softly’s eye. “I suppose they are awful easy creatures to get mixed up.” “Not if you know what you’re at,” Softly said. “I saw a drone,” Bimbo announced. “Flitting about over Marcus Landry’s fields. He’s shipped them in from the States.” “A drone?” Peader asked. “It’s like a little unmanned craft,” Bimbo said. “I heard talk about him at something like that, alright,” Softly said. “Shush,” Eustace said, eyes intent on the telly. “That’ll do, Mikey.” A playback of a woman’s track race was on. It was the interval before the race, where the competitors warm up and reticently perform their rituals. Mikey kept the sound low. Bimbo opened his packet of crisps and offered around to no avail. He wondered what Softly and the younger McIlendin were playing at. It was an awful suggestible alignment they were in, though there was nothing anyone could say, because it could all be innocent. Softly loved himself, was the thing, and the Stella one was lovely, but then the Denise one was lovely, too, and a normal man would be down on his knees with gratitude just to have the one or the other. But Softly was the type of fella would never settle for just satisfaction. Bimbo spouted the foil pack and shook the last crumbs of crisp into his palm. He licked his thumb for the last of the salt. He glanced at Denise. She was staring unhappily at the TV, the fingertips of one hand absently resting on her neck. “Back in a tick,” Bimbo muttered.  Bimbo stormed into the jacks, thrummed a sulfurous piss into the gurgling trough. On the wall above the urinal someone had written: aisling mcilenden wont you suck me offbehind your daddys fodder trough Bimbo tutted. Aisling was the third McIlenden sister, only in college still, and in Bimbo’s estimation the least fine, but that was only relatively speaking. Aisling McIlenden was lovely, and there was absolutely no call for such public traduction of her or indeed any other lass on account of just being good-looking. Bimbo spat into his palm and tried rubbing the foul couplet away, but it was written in permanent marker. He ground the heel of his palm in a circle against the cool brick, and even as he did so he felt his horn rouse in his other hand. “Ah now,” he said, disgusted at his body’s impertinence. A trace of Denise McIlenden’s scent had carried itself into the bleachy stench of the jacks, and it taunted Bimbo’s nose and went down into his body and taunted him in his blood. Bimbo stepped into a stall, drew the latch. Thirty seconds later he came back out and washed his hands in the sink. When Bimbo returned to the lounge there was a young man sitting on the stool that would have been Bimbo’s if Bimbo had taken a seat. The young man had the hunched, spidery posture of an adolescent, though his face looked older. He was dressed in black, and he had a sword. Bimbo did not register the sword at first, because who expects a sword? The first thing he noticed was the silence that had settled over the other patrons, and for a humiliating moment he believed the silence was for him, that all present were somehow aware of what he had just done in the jacks. The young man turned to Mikey. “As I was saying. . . ” Then Bimbo noticed the sword, the young man’s hand nestled around the long handle. The sword was sheathed in a scabbard and resting across his knees. “You were saying you walked here,” Mikey said. “I was saying it’s a fair walk to here from all the way over beyond in Foxford,” the young man said. Bimbo made his way over to the counter. “It is a fair walk if you walked it, alright,” Bimbo said. It was eleven miles to Foxford, and there were no streetlights on the country road once you got out of the town, and this kid was in dark clothing. He would not have made it this far without having been run into the ditch a hundred times. “This is Swinford I’m landed in?” the young man asked. “As near as makes no odds,” Bimbo said. “It’s just I’m not familiar,” the young man said. “Swinford is to me a place you only ever pass through.” “Let’s go,” Denise McIlenden said to Softly and stood up. Her eyes were wide and white. Everyone else had the half-lidded, deferred expressions of people who could not tell what it was they were looking at. He was just a young man. He had a sword. Bimbo could not believe it. Denise picked her purse up from off the bar counter and flusteredly tugged the strap over her shoulder. “What are you doing?” Softly asked. “I’d like to go now is what I’d like,” Denise said. “We have drinks,” Softly said. “Well I am going.” “No one should leave on my account, is what no one should do,”the young man said. He shifted on the stool, and Bimbo’s heart jumped. But the young man stayed seated. Softly reached out and put his hand on Denise’s forearm. “Finish your drink,” he said. “I don’t want it.” “Just sit. For five more minutes.” “So did you say you are from Foxford?” Rory said to the young man. “No,” the young man said. “But you said you just came from there, just now.” “I know the place,” the young man said. “My father lives that way. I should say used to live that way. There’s a dry-out clinic there in Foxford—did you know that?” “I did know that,” said Rory. “I would know Foxford well, what there is of it to know. What has you all the way out this way?” “None of your business,” the young man said. “I was just being polite.” “I don’t think you were just being polite.” “I think I was, as a matter of fact,” said Rory. “Come here,” Eustace said to the young man. “Do you want a drink?” “I do not drink,” the young man said and swallowed. “I mean I should not drink.” “Says who now?” Eustace asked. “It would be the general opinion held of me I should not drink.” “That would be the general opinion held of most of us, I reckon,” Eustace said. “When I was twelve,” Rory said, “I pinned a pioneer badge to my chest and forswore the taking of drink for all time. By the time I was thirteen I was lashing the Guinness into me like a water buffalo.” “You have a weak will,” the young man said. “That could certainly have been a factor,” said Rory. “Do not be coming in here telling people they are weak-willed,” Denise said. The young man looked at Denise. “Are you a cat lady or a dog lady?” he asked her. “Excuse me?” Denise said. “Are you a cat lady. Or a dog lady.” “Oh ho ho,” Bimbo said. “This is one of them riddles.” “How is it a riddle?” Eustace asked. “He’s just asking for a preference.” “It is a riddle,” Bimbo insisted. “The choices are symbolical. The dog is God in this equation. The dog is always God.” “She’s a dog lady,” Softly said to the young man. “Good,” the young man said. “I have always considered myself. . . a dog man.” “What’s the cat, so, in the equation?” Eustace asked Bimbo. “Cats are awful eerie creatures,” the young man said. “And they should never have been domesticated.” “Will you settle now and have that drink?” Bimbo said to the young man. “What are you drinking?” the young man asked, nodding at Bimbo’s pint. “This?” “Yes. What is it?” “It’s a Guinness, lad,” Bimbo said, with some incredulity. An Irishman not knowing what a Guinness was. It was like looking at a boot and not knowing what it was. “Can I have one of them?” the young man asked. “I suppose you can,” said Bimbo. “How many of them would you drink of a night?” “Of a night? Well now, maybe twelve.” “Twelve is an awful load.” “It is, but sure don’t I’ve an awful spacious build on me,” Bimbo said. “This fella,” Eustace said, nodding at the young man. “This fella is unreal,” Rory said. “You’re unreal, lad,” Bimbo said to the young man. “Mikey, get this unreal young fella a Guinness.” “Aye,” Mikey said. “Make it a good one,” Bimbo said. “I’m not going into rounds, though,” the young man said. “Well, there’s nobody here saying you have to do that,” Bimbo said. “I know it’s the convention. You buy me one, I buy you one back. But I’m not going into rounds, I can tell you that.” “Good on you, young fella,” Moira said. “The round mentality is an awful egregious one.” “You have a sword,” Bimbo said to the young man. The young man looked down at his lap. “I do.” “Why do you have a sword?” Bimbo asked. “For protection.” “Who do you need protecting from?” “From my brothers.” “Oh. How many brothers do you have?” “Nine.” “Nine?” “Nine.” “That’s some collection of brothers to have in this day and age,” Bimbo said. “It would be,” said the young man. “And how many of these nine brothers want to hurt you then?” “Oh, just like. . . ” The young man shifted without energy in his seat. “I would say just two or three of them.” “And why do they want to hurt you?” The young man blinked, swallowed. Mikey presented him with his Guinness. The young man rotated the glass on the counter, and both he and Bimbo considered the cream head. “That’s some pour, Mikey,” Bimbo said. “Head on it as neat as a hotel duvet.” “By all accounts I don’t endear myself to people in my actions or manner,” the young man said. “So I have been told.” “Even if that’s true I doubt it merits going about the place with a sword, now does it?” Bimbo asked. “It is a katana, to be accurate,” the young man said. “Hah?” grunted Bimbo. “Properly speaking, it is a katana blade,” the young man said. “Arm of choice among the warrior class in feudal Japan.” “A katana,” interjected Softly. “That’s what I thought, alright.” “Well of course Softly knew it was a katana,” Bimbo said. “Give him another minute and he’ll be lecturing the lad on how he’s holding it wrong.” “Are we alright, Bimbo?” Softly asked. “Don’t be telling the fella whose walked in off the Foxford road with a katana in his hand that you know more about his blade than he does,” Bimbo said. “I’m not saying I know more than him,” retorted Softly. “I’m just saying that I had in mind that the blade was a katana. Sure you’d need see only a couple of samurai movies to know that.” “I can’t take this,” said Denise. She got back up off her stool. “Sit down, D,” Softly said. “To be accurate, it is a replica,” continued the young man. “A high-end replica, but a replica all the same.” “Can you run someone through with it?” asked Bimbo. “I. Am. Leaving,” Denise said. “Leave so,” Softly said. “You can,” said the young man. “But it lacks the tensility, lightness, and penetrative edge of a genuine katana. With a well-timed slash you could disembowel somebody no bother with the genuine article, but not so with a replica.” “Are you handy with it anyway?” Bimbo asked. “My technique does need work,” the young man said. “Will you show us?” Bimbo asked. “Please do not take out the sword,” Denise said. “Yeah,” drawled Mikey. “I don’t think I can entertain a drawn sword on the premises, lads.” “Don’t heed them, young fella,” Rory said. “I mean we are definitely in dicey territory already,” Mikey said, “just having a sword on the premises in the first instance.” “It’s a replica of a sword, not a sword itself,” Bimbo said. “Fair point,” Eustace said. “Would you require a license for a sword?” Peader Ginty asked. “That’s an awful good question, Daddy,” Moira said. “Go on, buck,” Bimbo said. “Get out on the floor and throw us a few samurai shapes.” The young man, who was looking increasingly grave and agitated, took a long pull of his Guinness. “Yucky,” he said. “That’s the stuff for you,” Rory said. The young man stood up off his stool, strode into the middle of the lounge floor, and smoothly drew the blade out of the scabbard. He raised the sword over his head, and the contour of its curve flashed in the bar light. He braced his thighs, leaned to his left, and whipped the blade down and back up in a clean arc, repeated the gesture on his right side. “Jesus Christ,” Denise said. “Fair play,” Bimbo said. “Lads, seriously, I can’t be sanctioning this,” Mikey said. “We. Have. To. Go,” Denise said. Softly, jaw clenched, got up off his stool and marched smartly to the clubhouse door. He fumbled in his jacket pocket, pulled out his car keys. Nudging open the door with his foot, he flung the keys out into the dark of the lot, then marched back to his stool and sat down. “Go when you like so, D,” he said in a tight, low voice. “Mikey, another pint.” “Congratulations,” Denise said. “Congratulations on thinking that one through. The joke is absolutely on me here, Softly.” Softly shrugged, mouth shrunk to an impenitent asterisk. “Can I have a go?” Bimbo asked the young man. The young man carefully drew the katana back into the scabbard. “I would say no.” “For why? I just want a go.” “I think you’re mocking.” “I am not mocking!” Bimbo said. “I’d say he is mocking, lad,” Moira said. “Bimbo, will you let the young fella alone,” Peader said with a gasp. “The Alp boys think everything is a joke,” Moira said. “Moira,” Bimbo said. “You are an awful acute pain in the hole, do you know that?” Moira cackled ruefully. “And you’re as easy as the breeze to rile.” Rory slid from his seat and moved with surprising nimbleness up behind the young man. He enclosed his arms around the young man, trapping his arms and torso, then squeezed and lifted. The young man ejected a startled yelp and began to furiously paddle his long legs in the air, like a cartoon character. Bimbo grabbed the sheathed katana and wrenched it free of the young man’s constrained hands. Rory then hefted the young man over to one of the lounge sofas, dropped him sideways onto the cushions, and sat down on his shoulder, pinning him in place. “Don’t be wriggling,” Rory said as the young man thrashed and wheezed, his face turning bright pink. “Ah, lads,” Mikey said. Eustace went over and sat down on the young man’s legs. “Lads, come on,” Mikey said. “Watch now,” Bimbo said, delighted. He drew the katana from its scabbard. He held it up and out. The sword wobbled a bit. Bimbo tried to reproduce the fine arc the young man had cut in the air but swung loosely, and at the apex of his swing the katana almost jumped free of his grasp. Softly sprung up off his stool. “Watch where you’re flittering that thing,” he said. “I am watching,” Bimbo said defensively, and slid the sword back into its scabbard.  The clubhouse door opened. Two men entered. The first man had his arm out and was holding a set of keys like they were a dead mouse. “Some cretin left his keys in the middle of the parking lot and they’d be still there only I trod on them getting out of the car,” he announced. “It appears he is here,” said the second man to the first. “It appears them two gentlemen over there are sitting on top of his head.” “Of course they are,” said the man with the keys. It was clear the two men were related to the young man with the sword. They had the same gangling cuts to their bearings and the same shining, disconnected look in their eyes. The second man was holding a golf club, a driver with a big, solid head. Denise walked up to the first man. “Give here,” she said, “they belong to us.” The man drew the keys close to his chest, considered them. “These are the keys to a Mondeo,” he said. “What sort of reckless idiot is dropping the keys to a Mondeo out in an empty car park? Believe me, I’ll take the Mondeo off your hands if you’re that fed up with it.” “The keys were pegged out there,” Denise said. “I am here with a big giant man-baby, and it was the man-baby went and pegged the keys out the door about five minutes ago in a fit of temper.” “Do not call me a man-baby,” Softly said. “You mean to say that lad purposefully pegged the keys to a Mondeo out into the lot?” said the first man. “Thank you for picking them up,” Denise said, her hand out. “Well I honestly don’t know if the kind of person who would do a thing like that merits having their keys returned to them,” the first man said. “I would entirely agree,” Denise said. “Only I need them keys to get home. The man-baby can walk for all I care.” “I SAID THAT’S OUR LITTLE BROTHER YOU’VE YOUR HOLES PARKED ON,” the man with the club roared in the direction of Rory and Eustace. The young man had more or less stopped thrashing and was lying limply beneath the brothers’ substantial behinds. “To be fair there’s a very good reason for this arrangement,” Eustace said. “Your little brother strode in out of the wilds with a sword on his person,” Rory said. “A katana,” Eustace said. “A katana,” Rory said. “Only what kind of a person does that? A person in need of subduing, I’d say.” “That fella needs more than subduing is what that fella needs,” said the first man. “Come up,” said the second man. He strode forward, brandishing the golf club two-handedly and with evident purpose. Rory and Eustace, intuiting the man’s capability, got onto their feet and stepped clear of the young man. The young man tried to scramble upright. The man drew the golf club back over his shoulder and swung down with all his might, the head of the club landing on the forearm the young man instinctively thrust out. The young man screamed. The man with the club got off three decisive swings, connecting meatily with the young man’s limbs and torso as the young man flailed backward off the sofa and tried to cram his entire stringy body in under a tabletop. The man with the club stopped his attack. He paced around in a little circle, breathing heavily through his nose. “Come out from under that table, Derek,” he said with no venom in his voice, just even brotherly solicitude. “What’s all this in aid of?” Rory said. “Who are you?” said the first man. “Who are you?” Rory said. “We are this Clem’s brothers, for our sins,” said the man with the golf club. “And what did your brother do warrants getting absolutely laced out of it with a golf club?” Eustace asked. “He topped Mammy’s Sphynx,” the first man said. “Hah?” Eustace said. “The mammy’s Sphynx,” said the man with the golf club. “It’s a breed of cat. High pedigree, very delicate, very expensive. We got it for the mammy last year when the oul fella finally kicked the bucket.” “Be way of company for her,” the first man said. “The oul fella was useless company, but he was company all the same,” the man with the club said. “Daddy was an awful prick is what Daddy was,” the young man said from under the table. “Shut up, Derek,” the first man said. “A thousand bucks,” the man with the golf club said. “A thousand bucks of an outlay for this creature, and it hadn’t a hair on its entire body,” the first man said. “The heating bills she was landed with.” “The mammy had to keep the house equatorial the whole year round, the rads on full pelt,” the man with the golf club said. “And the awful expensive food it could only eat.” “And all the shots it had to keep getting.” “It was an awful oul sickly oul wrinkly oul bald oul yoke.” “It looked like a shaved ball bag is what it looked like,” the man with the club said. “But she loved it,” the first man said. “She loved it, and this useless article under the table here only had to go after it with a sword,” the man with the club said, “and stab the poor yoke to death. And he near killed the mother too with the fright he put on her.” “What sort of a man has it in him to top a cat?” the first man said. The young man was silent under the table, his long feet sticking out. “That cat was always mocking me,” he said eventually. The man with the club sighed. “It was a cat, Derek.” “They are not the most amenable creatures, but still,” the first man said. “Come out now until we go home, Derek,” the man with the club said. “No,” the young man said. “Derek, come out before I drag you out and make a further mock of you in front of all your new friends.” “No. You’ve my head ringing.” The man with the club darted forward and got ahold of one of the young man’s heels. The young man wrapped his arms around the center beam of the table. The man with the club began towing the young man. The table toppled over, but the young man steadfastly clung to it and dragged it along with him across the burgundy carpet. “Ah, here,” Bimbo said, stepping across the path of the man with the club, fist tight around the handle of the katana. “I’m not saying he didn’t do what you said he did, but touched as he is I can’t let you be dragging that fella out the door like that. It is awful unseemly.” The man with the club stopped and looked at Bimbo. The young man looked up from the floor at Bimbo. “That’s your own brother you’re making a spectacle of,” Rory said to the man with the club. “I know Derek looks harmless,” the first man said. “But the truth is he is a living trial.” “Sure, aren’t we all,” Bimbo said. “Aren’t we all living trials to one another.” “Maybe it’s you two should leave, and let the young fella here with us,” Eustace said. Rory and Eustace had arranged themselves so that they now stood flanking Bimbo. The man with the club considered the solid wall of the Alps boys. He looked at the first man. The first man shrugged. The man with the club dropped the young man’s foot to the floor. “Ow,” said the young man. “He should be in a home is where he should be,” the man with the club said. “But the mother wouldn’t have it. Well she has gone and learned her lesson now.” The two men began to back toward the clubhouse door. “Here,” Denise McIlenden shouted at the first man. “The keys.” The first man checked, looked at the keys in his hand, lobbed them at Denise. “Were you really going to set on me with a replica sword?” the man with the club asked Bimbo. “I can’t be sanctioning you boys coming in here leathering the shite out of this young fella and dragging him around the place like a bit of lawn furniture, no matter what he’s did,” Bimbo said. The man with the club sighed. “Setting on your own brother,” he said. “I know it’s not right. I know there’s nothing in it that’s a credit to me. But what that fella sees fit to put her through.” “They are awful saints, mothers, aren’t they,” Bimbo said. “They are,” said the man with the club. He tucked the driver under his arm, took out his wallet, flicked through it. “Here,” he said to the first man. “Have you a twenty?” “What?” said the first man. “Have you a twenty? Give it here.” The first man made a face but complied. The man with the club took the twenty, added a twenty of his own, and handed the money over to Mikey. “The next round,” the man with the club said. To the young man he said, “Derek, I am sorry I took Daddy’s club to you.” “I’m sore all over.” The two men left. “Well now,” Bimbo said. “Wasn’t that very good of them,” Moira said. “Come up here, young fella,” Rory said, extending a hand to the young man still on his back on the floor. The young man accepted, and Rory hauled him up onto his feet. “You look as shook,” Moira said to the young man. “Mikey, will you run this man a big glass of water?” Rory said. “When you’re shook you need to hydrate.” “If you are peckish, I’ve a heap more toasties in the fridge,” Mikey said. “I have no appetite on me,” the young man said. “Well done, the Alps boys,” Peader Ginty said. “Aye, well done on not getting your heads cracked open, much as you were trying,” Softly said. “Softly,” Denise said, “shut up.” “What?” Softly said. “The Alps boys put themselves on the line for that oddball of a young fella,” Denise said. “He was getting a beating and they saved him from much worse. And what did you do? Pegged the keys to your Mondeo into the night like a child. That goon was right about you.” “I didn’t heed a thing that goon said about me,” Softly said. “Where are you off to?” Softly said. Denise opened the door. “You know what I’ve noticed about you, Softly?” Softly said nothing. “You’re as stingy,” Denise continued. “You’ve the stingiest outlook on the world. You’re incapable of extending even the tiniest untainted compliment to anyone, about anything, and it is awful wearying to be around.” She left. All within listened to the whinny and growl of the Mondeo’s engine out in the lot, watched the headlights bloom on the clubhouse windows, and heard the crackle of the gravel as the car turned and left. “Well now,” Moira said. Mikey placed a pint of tap water on the counter. “Drink,” Bimbo said, guiding the young man back onto the stool. The young man gulleted down the water in one go, exhaled, and wiped his mouth. “Good lad. This is yours,” Bimbo said and handed the replica katana back. “Face is shining up decently now,” Rory said. “He landed a rap on your head, did he,” Eustace said. “He got me everywhere,” the young man said. “Where’s it hurt most?” Bimbo asked. “All over.” “Can you move your arm freely?” Bimbo asked. He took hold of the young man’s forearm and moved it in a slow circle. “How sore is that?” “It’s. . . not too bad.” “Did you really stab your mother’s cat?” Eustace asked. “I am not proud.” “Well, you wouldn’t be,” Eustace said. “No,” said the young man. He licked his lips and fainted forward. “Watch,” Bimbo said. All the color was gone out of the young man’s face. He dropped his head and the water came back up in an opaque gout, drenching his shins and shoes and the carpet. “Ah now,” Bimbo said, the toes of his workboots spattered. “I don’t feel good,” the young man moaned into his chest and fainted forward again, Bimbo catching him so he would not land on the floor. Bimbo ducked down to see the young man’s face. His eyes were rolling in his head. “I think he’s out.” “Put him on his back on the ground,” Moira said. “I am ringing Castlebar General,” Mikey said. “He could swallow his tongue. Don’t let him swallow his tongue,” Moira said, up off her stool. Her father, Peader, began also to rise. “Daddy, don’t put yourself out,” Moira said. Bimbo tossed the young man’s sword to the floor and guided his limp body down onto the carpet. He tapped the young man’s cheek with two fingers. “Does he have a pulse?” Rory asked. “I don’t know if I know how to do that,” Bimbo said, licking his thumb and sticking it right in under the young man’s nose. “He is breathing, I reckon,” he said. “Hello—” said Mikey into his phone. He spluttered through a series of questions with the hospital operator, saying only that the young man had received a heavy accidental blow to the head. He relayed to the Alps the operator’s instructions about keeping the head elevated and the airways unobstructed. “Okay,” said Mikey into the phone, “Okay, okay.” “How long?” Rory said. “Said the ambulance would be thirty minutes.” “Thirty minutes!” Rory shouted. “Here, get him up. Thirty minutes. We’ll have him to the General in half that.” “That HiAce is a junk-heap,” Moira said. “No way you are doing the trip quicker than an ambulance.” “She’s lightning once she gets into her stride,” Rory said. “Here, Softly, give us a hand.” Softly hunkered down and grabbed the young man’s spare leg. Bimbo had the other one, and Eustace and Rory each took a shoulder. The quartet lifted the young man up and began to stagger forward. Mikey came out from behind the bar and held the door. Moira and Peader, towing his trolley bag, took up the rear. Moira picked the sword up on the way. The four men crunched across the gravel, floundering one way and then the other, but they did not drop the young man’s body, which sagged like a laden hammock between them. Bimbo glanced toward the floodlit pitch. There was now a cow under the crossbar, nibbling at the grass edging the rutted bald spot of the goalmouth. Ahead of them, another cow was rubbing its ribs against a corner of the HiAce’s grille. Bimbo saw and sensed more big shapes gliding around in the dark of the lot. “Cows,” Peader stated. “Well spotted,” Bimbo said. “Go on, get,” Rory said, and with his head butted the neck of the cow that was using the HiAce as a scratching post. It mooed and started away. “Where’d they come out of though?” Eustace asked. “The fencing is in an awful state down the far end of the grounds. They could be in from any of them fields adjacent,” Mikey said, reaching out to pat the haunch of a ginger heifer as it lumbered by. “Never mind about the cows,” Bimbo demanded. He let down the young man’s leg, pulled back the HiAce’s side door, sprung in, and commenced kicking a clearing amid the boxes of various-size screws and the coiled yards of insulated wire. Rory, Eustace, and Softly transferred the young man onto the van’s dirt-caked mat. The young man moaned, lifted his head up. “What’s happening?” “We’re saving your life is what’s happening,” Bimbo said, the heel of his hand on the young man’s chest to stay him from getting up. Softly climbed in. “Am I dying?” the young man said. “No one is dying on our watch,” Bimbo declared. Softly began clambering into the HiAce. “What are you doing?” Bimbo asked. “I—I want to help,” Softly said. “Go on, so,” Bimbo said, and moved his haunches so Softly could get in. Rory got in behind the wheel, and Eustace joined him up front. “Are you okay to drive with pints on you?” asked Mikey through the wound-down driver’s-side window. Rory turned on the engine and considered the question. “I would say I drive better with drink taken,” he said, “because I know I have to be more careful.” “Well, good luck,” Mikey said doubtfully and rapped the side of the van. There were dozens of cows stood around in the lot, gormless as wardrobes. Rory gunned the engine, pounded the horn, and nosed the HiAce forward until the animals began to lumber out of the way. With a parting shout of “Up Mayo” out the window, like they were cheering on a football game, and a last beep, the HiAce snarled onto the main road and raced off into the night. “Lordy,” Moira said. “Indeed,” Mikey said. By the clubhouse entrance a wall light illuminated the backless wooden bench and pail of sand that denoted the smoking area. Peader wheeled his trolley over, and Moira and Mikey followed, Moira idly swishing the sword in the air. Mikey sat down beside Peader and lit a cigarette, nodded at the sword. “You forget to hand that over?” “I suppose I did,” Moira said. Mikey looked with dismay down the long dark length of the lot. He couldn’t see the cows, but they were there. “This place will be absolutely covered in shit tomorrow morning,” he said. Moira was looking at the peeling band of Mikey’s neck. She reached out, felt the seethe of the sunburn on the pads of her fingertips. “That must hurt,” she said. “It’s grand,” Mikey said. Moira propped the sword against the wall by the bench, opened her purse, brought out a small tube, and squirted a curlicue of cream into her palm. She stepped in behind Mikey. “It’s fine,” Mikey said. “Don’t be a boy.” Moira’s fingers were thin and hard, kneading in the cold of the cream. It did feel good. Mikey took a drag, relinquished a long sigh. He held the cigarette up so Moira could take it over his shoulder. “I have to go in now, and root out a flashlight and ascertain which field these cows got out of, and then go ring whichever farmer.” “Poor Mikey,” Moira said. “Poor Mikey,” Peader agreed. “You think that young fella will be alright?” Mikey asked. “I would say the brother should have given him a few extra lashes while he was at it,” Moira said. “Moira, stop,” Peader said. “That fella was not right, Daddy. He had an awful sinister cut to him altogether.” “He did admit to topping a cat,” Mikey said. “Well, that is not usual behavior,” Peader said. “That buck was from another planet,” Moira said. “And the Alps have him now,” Mikey said. “Speaking of other planets,” Moira said. “What have you got against the Alps anyway?” Mikey asked. Moira slapped her hands together, stepped back from Mikey. “I drive better with drink taken,” she said. “I guess you can’t argue with that logic.” “You can’t,” Mikey said. “And won’t you be driving home with a few on you yourself?” “I will,” Moira said, “but I won’t be proud of it. That’s the difference.” “Oh, I’d love a go,” Peader said, watching his daughter smoke. “You could have one puff,” Moira said, “if it was just the one. But it wouldn’t be, would it.” “It would not,” Peader agreed. “I think we will say good night, young Mikey. Hope you get this mess sorted.” Moira passed the cigarette back to Mikey. “Keep the sword,” she said. “Good night,” Mikey said, and watched the two walk off into the night, Peader trailing his trolley. Mikey was able to mark their progress by the snorts of consternation that came from the invisible cows. Mikey smoked the remainder of the cigarette and studied the sky, the glimmering points of the stars, for the trace of a fugitive movement, but none was forthcoming. He went into the clubhouse, rooted out a torch. Back out at the smoking area, he hesitated by the sheathed sword, propped against the wall where Moira had left it. He picked it up and set off into the dark of the grounds, looking for the rupture or gap, or wherever it was the cows had come out of. is the author of the story collection Young Skins (Grove Press).

        "story": "On a November Saturday in 1990, Pam went over to Joe’s place to listen to records. It was raining in sheets that whipped around the corners of buildings and blowing so hard that women in heels were taking men’s arms to cross the street. Cars were plowing bow waves through puddles of scum. As Joe was letting Pam into the apartment, a man emerged from the bedroom with a square sheet of black plastic in his hand and said, “Hey, man, you have the Sassy Sonic Youth flexi!” “I subscribed to that magazine the second I heard of it,” Joe said. “It’s not long for this world,” Pam said, hanging up her coat. “What’s the demographic supposed to be—thirteen-year-old girls who fuck? Advertisers really go for that.” “Nice to meet you,” the stranger said, stepping forward and holding out his hand. “Daniel Svoboda.” “Pam Diaphragm,” she said. “Sassy is the dying gasp of straight mainstream pedophilia.” “I read it for the political coverage,” Daniel said. “I first heard of it from a bald guy who does in-flight programming at Eastern,” Pam said. “So can we listen to this flexi?” “I’m a Sonic Youth completist,” Joe said, taking the single from Daniel and arranging it on the turntable. “The only record I don’t have is the Forced Exposure subscribers-only single ‘I Killed Christgau with My Big Fuckin’ Dick.’ ” “That’s not a real record,” Daniel said. “Byron Coley made that up.” Byron Coley was the editor of Forced Exposure and Robert Christgau was the chief music critic of the Village Voice, as Daniel did not feel called upon to explain to Pam. Illustration by Dante Terzigni She found herself attracted to Daniel. He had not asked her real name. His sophistication and knowledge seemed to resemble her own. She commenced phrasing a friendly remark. She put the brakes on. They say that you truly know a man only after you’ve seen him with his male friends, but this friend was Joe, who might not count. Furthermore, it had been demonstrated in empirical trials that a woman gravitates to the sexiest man in the room. Here, again, Joe was setting the bar low. She said instead, “It’s Christgau who’s a big fucking dick.” “I wouldn’t go that far,” Daniel replied. “But you can’t grade music on a bell curve. Mediocrity is not the norm. Most records either rock or they suck.” “I’m kind of over grades myself. Did you just get out of college?” “Yeah. You should see my awesome transcript and G.R.E.s. That’s how I qualified to work as a proofreader.” “I’m a programmer, but I never finished high school.” “Silence, lovebirds,” Joe said, dropping the needle. “Prepare to rock.” Daniel worked nights, proofreading documents for a big law office in Midtown. The job required an eye for detail. He had trained his visual perspicacity for four years, at taxpayer expense, while acquiring a B.A. in art history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He knew there was such a thing as a job in his major, but unless he counted the college faculty, he’d never met anybody who had one. His superfluous college career could be traced to—or blamed on—a sexy substitute teacher who rambled on about art and revolution for two days in eleventh grade when the world history teacher had the flu. At any moment, he could have improvised a touching essay about how he was first inspired by Mrs.Ellis to believe in a power higher than Jesus Christ. But eleventh grade was too late to adopt the praxis of art and create a portfolio adequate to gain admission to some kind of secular-humanist academy. He could play an instrument—the clarinet—but stiltedly, because of a lack of instruction and role models, and it had never seemed potentially useful to him for purposes of art music, which he naïvely understood to include progressive rock. He gave it up when he got to college, because he loathed spending his free time at parades and football games. Also he feared it was giving him buckteeth. He wasn’t vain, but—here, again, inspired by Mrs.Ellis—he sensed that he should hang on to what little beauty he had. His good physical features were, in order of scarcity in the general population: broad shoulders and narrow hips; an attractive mouth (full lips, straight teeth, odorless); thick curly hair (dark brown). Not-so-good features: moderate acne scarring; incipient jowls; hairy feet; hairy back; hairy face (he had to shave all the way up to his eyes). Ambiguous feature: five feet eleven inches tall, a towering and uncomfortable giant among Asian immigrants in Chinatown, inconspicuous by the standards of Midtown or the financial district. He never got his dream job at his favorite record store in Madison, but he regularly met musicians through his shifts at a Subway sandwich shop. By neglecting his studies, he was able to soldier his way upward through the hierarchy of the university radio station until he had a two-hour show on Monday mornings, shocking people awake with the Residents and Halo of Flies. He had come to New York with eight hundred dollars in savings expressly dedicated to the release of the seven-inch single that would put Daniel Svoboda on the map. Not as a musician. He wanted to found a record label. By dint of his radio experience and strategic mail ordering from ads in Forced Exposure and Maximum Rocknroll, he knew his single didn’t have to be so great musically. What it needed was reverb on the vocals, chorus on the guitar, and compression on everything else. The sound would be “warm” and “punchy.” The au courant Midwestern sound was grunge with vocals lowered by an octave. The band posters showed nitrogen funny cars shooting flames. What he had in mind was something different: breathy female vocals over propulsive guitar drones, like My Bloody Valentine, only faster. The key element was the woman-girl-child singer—a delicate, tight-throated slip of a thing, aspirating her lines like Jane Birkin on “Je t’aime. . . moi non plus,” but buried under a mass of guitar noise. In terms of artistic lineage, she would be somewhere between Goethe’s Mignon and André Breton’s Nadja. Daniel was eager to know whether Pam could sing. At Daniel’s suggestion, Pam and Joe met him at noon on a Saturday in front of the Music Palace, a large cinema on Bowery. It was getting close to Christmas. The streets were full of shoppers looking for bargains on the latest Chinese-made goods, such as dish towels and those little plastic rakes and buckets kids take to the beach in summer. They bought a six of Michelob at the grocery store next door and hid it in Pam’s backpack. The theater was almost empty. A few men were sleeping toward the back or milling around the bathrooms behind the screen, recent Asian arrivals with nowhere else to go. The double feature paired an action movie set in Mexico with a kung fu fantasy about medieval China. It ran all day and night. The action movie had already started, so they didn’t get to talking until the intermission. Pam, hoping to arouse Daniel’s curiosity, mentioned how much she was dreading practice. He said, “What kind of practice?” Joe said, “She’s in this hard-sucking power duo that has no songs.” “Like I always say, if you gotta suck, suck loud,” Pam said. “The Diaphragms have rehearsal space, a drum machine, and no pride. I’d make a speech tomorrow at practice and say it’s all over, but the keyboard player happens to be my roommate.” “Ooh,” Daniel said. “It’s hellish. And the worst part is we really do suck. I use so much distortion that all I have to do is look at the guitar and it feeds back. I loop it through a delay and play along with myself. Does it sound dumb yet?” “Potentially. Can you play barre chords?” “Are you asking can I play guitar? Yeah, sure. I can even sing. But there’s something about this band. I don’t want it to be good. I want it to suck, so Simon’s band will suck. It’s the most self-destructive thing I’ve ever done, and that’s saying a lot. I need to quit.” Daniel hesitated. “I don’t want to be in a band,” he ventured, not sure he would be believed. “I truly don’t. You could say I’m more the camp-follower type. I like a certain kind of music, and I want to get people listening to it. I had a radio show in college. I want to start a label.” “What kind of stuff?” Joe interrupted them, saying, “Let’s have a band! We’ll call it Marmalade Sky. It’s me on bass, Pam on guitar, and you on keyboards. We all sing. We have three-part harmonies. We practice at your house. I write the songs. Prepare to rock!” Daniel said, “You’re barking up the wrong tree, man. I can’t play keyboards. Maybe I could fake drums.” “There’s too much drums in songs all the time,” Joe said. “You play keyboards.” “I’m in,” Pam said. “Next stop, Marmalade Sky.” “So what’s my label called?” Daniel asked Joe. “Lion’s Den, because of Daniel in the lion’s den.” “That sounds like reggae, when ‘Marmalade Sky’ sounds like bad British psychedelia.” “Together they fit how we’re going to sound, which is free dub-rock fusion.” “He could be right,” Pam said. “He did without an amp for so long, he’s the Charlie Haden of punk rock. I mean, relatively speaking.” “Pam’s the worst lead guitar player in the universe,” Joe said. “Her fingers move like it’s freezing out and she lost her mittens. But in Marmalade Sky, she plays massive power chords she knows how to play, and I play the tunes.” “I play like I’m wearing the mittens,” she corrected. “It’s the evil influence of Simon. He wants everything to sound like it’s been dragged through candied heroin.” “He’s your roommate and in your band?” Daniel asked. “You must be close friends.” “We’re extremely intimate.” She rolled her eyes. “It sounds to me like you should cut him off and never look back. I mean, as a disinterested third party.” “I didn’t mean to imply that he’s on drugs. There are more things at the bottom of the barrel than drugs.” “Can you please play keyboards?” Joe asked Daniel. “You truly don’t want to hear me try.” “You have to,” Joe insisted. “We can’t have a band unless we’re all in it!” “I want to put out the band on my label, not play in it.” “It will be absolutely no fun being rock stars and getting laid and everything like that if you aren’t in the band. You have to play something!” “It’s better money,” Pam pointed out. “A manager gets twenty percent, but as a band member you’d get a third.” “Twenty off the top plus a third puts me at forty-seven percent,” Daniel said. “And we make it all back from record sales and touring!” Joe said. “I have a day job already,” Pam said. “Me too,” Joe said. “I mean touring in the city.” “What I have is more like a night job,” Daniel said. “But fine, let’s talk about how I’m going to hang it up because I’m raking it in with art for art’s sake.” “We’re going to be rolling in it,” Joe said, as though reminding him of an established fact, “because I’m writing the songs.” Daniel and Pam exchanged a look that said the band would fail no matter what, if only because Joe was writing the songs. There was a shared bemused affection for him in the look already. “You’re going to be the next Neil Diamond,” Daniel said. “Hasil Adkins,” Pam said. “Roy Orbison!” Joe said. The next morning, Pam told Simon that she was going to the practice space without him because she could afford it on her own. Ten dollars an hour isn’t much for a programmer. She said she was done with the Diaphragms. The band had never worked. She had a new project that might. To forestall any hopes on his side, she said he wasn’t welcome in the new project. The whole routine made her nervous. She stood by the door, guitar on her back and effects bag in her hand, making this insulting speech as if expecting immediate capitulation, knowing better than to expect it. Simon said, “That’s my practice space, not yours. I already advertised for a new guitar player.” “So why aren’t you going there now?” “I don’t have one yet. But I will.” She set her things down and said, “Simon, I know our love was beautiful, but we need to break up.” “I’m not moving out. I can’t even afford to practice by myself. You’re the one who just said ten dollars isn’t a lot of money. You move out. You can afford a place of your own. Just go.” He turned sulkily toward the cereal box on the table and sprinkled a few more squares of Chex into his slowly warming milk. Late Wednesday night, Pam was among the first to buy the Village Voice and turn to the real estate classifieds. She strode to a streetlamp to read. What she saw made her guts clench. Since her last move, her budgeted residential zone had shifted far away from Manhattan, past Brooklyn Heights. The studios she could afford were in places like Greenpoint and Astoria. Even Park Slope had apparently turned into a bourgeois hell of first-time home buyers bent on pretending their townhomes were brownstones on the Upper East Side. She regarded Brooklyn as a cultural wasteland. A summertime stroll up Flatbush with the devoted Brooklyn fan Joe hadn’t changed her mind. In a shop window she’d seen a dead branch spray-painted gold in a silver-painted vase priced at eighty dollars. She had attended an art opening in Williamsburg once, down near the water, and it still stuck with her, as though it might recur as a final image of vacuity before she died. She had narrowly missed the era when Alphabet City was controlled by Latino crime syndicates and inhabited by the living dead—honest-to-goodness cannibals—but Williamsburg was creepier, because there was nobody around. No buildings standing open with dim-eyed figures guarding holes leading to cellars; just walls and chain-link on all sides, and she and Joe the only pedestrians for miles. Cannibals could have eaten them right there on the street, without taking the trouble to drag them inside a building. When they got to the opening, the artworks turned out to be site-specific installations made of found objects. None of the so-called artists could afford supplies or a studio. It was literal arte povera. Then she sliced open the top of her right ear on a splinter of broken mirror some wannabe had hung from the ceiling with twine. She read the ads for Lower Manhattan again. Her hands and feet turned cold from the adrenaline, as if she’d been caught in a trap. To all appearances she was not leaving her lease on Bleecker Street. If Simon wasn’t either, she would have to put up with him. The winter settled in like a poisonous fog around the redundant American people. The war ramped up. Yellow ribbons appeared. Pam often wished aloud that the Selective Service System would draft Simon into the battle for Kuwait. Daniel had talked about the draft so much that she didn’t realize there was no draft. He was in touch with the American Friends Service Committee, on Joe’s behalf as well as his own, preparing for them to become conscientious objectors. He even took Joe to a Quaker meeting, but only once. The streets were dark at four o’clock. The wind whistled and rattled the signage. Pam and her co-workers sat idle in the conference room, watching a lot of TV. In mid-January, things got interesting. A CNN correspondent was trapped in Baghdad. He described his fear in great detail, conveying a sense that war was ultra-scary. The battlefields looked like barbecue grills—not arrangements of discrete wrecks and craters, but greasy charcoal melted to the pavement. America the Beautiful was taking no prisoners. Pam went to visit Daniel after work and found him downstairs in Video Hut, huddled up in his coat, watching CBS with his landlord, Victor. He pointed at the TV and said, “They’re landing Scuds on Tel Aviv. It’s Armageddon.” Daniel was not remotely Jewish, and he didn’t know any Israelis, but he had been raised in the kind of Christian household that promotes respect for the defense capabilities of Israel and belief in the apocalyptic consequences of putting the country’s back against the wall. Not that Israel couldn’t defend itself. Plucky little Israel had fended off repeated Arab invasions, and not through the power of prayer. It had fought valiantly and had developed—with French assistance, though Daniel couldn’t imagine why that was—a nuclear deterrent. Those who aided the enemies of Israel died. That’s what they did. For example, the Canadian engineer who decided to help Saddam build a cannon big enough to put two tons into orbit. He just up and died of gunshot wounds in Brussels. The respect was possibly overgenerous and the eschatological expectation overblown, but it was hard for Daniel to imagine Tel Aviv taking a Scud missile lying down. To make sure Pam knew what he meant, he added, “This is World War Three!” “Are they with nerve gas?” “They don’t know yet. Nobody wants to be first to take off the gas mask and find out. But it can’t be nerve gas, right? Israel would so totally nuke Baghdad. They want to draw Israel into the war, but they don’t want to die. If Israel sends even one plane into Iraqi airspace, it could draw the whole Arab world into the war.” “What do you think, Victor?” she asked. “Americans supply Israel with many things. Israel won’t interfere in our war.” “I think Israel goes its own way,” Daniel said. “They play all sides off against each other. They get less American support than you think.” “Israel and Iraq are nothing,” Victor said. “If they nuke each other, it’s not World War Three. It’s jackals fighting over a desert.” “Whoa,” Pam said, unused to hearing anything that could possibly have been construed as anti-Semitic. “Any war that goes nuclear is World War Three,” Daniel said. “And nuclear war involving Israel is Armageddon, any way you cut it up. So this is potential nuclear Armageddon. Babylon the great is fallen—is fallen. . . she who hath made all the other nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication!” He shouted the last bit because it was part of a Tragic Mulatto song. “Let’s wait first and see whether they use nerve gas,” Pam said. Victor offered to open a bottle of vodka to celebrate the coming American win. Daniel’s response was to proclaim, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” Victor reached under the counter, and Pam expressed admiration at his stocking bootleg vodka, which counted as her agreement to help them drink. They watched TV until eleven o’clock. Pam said she was too drunk to go straight home on foot. She went upstairs with Daniel to have some herbal tea. There they had sex for the first time. His doubts, hesitations, and regrets were as nothing in the face of the coming apocalypse. She felt none of the above. She wished she’d had the idea of sleeping with him long before. Band practice was interesting after that. Joe sang his songs while playing counterpoint melodies on the bass. Pam looked straight down at her left hand, and Daniel focused on the brushes with which he played a warped floor tom and broken snare. Every so often, the couple raised their eyes and nodded almost imperceptibly in greeting. In his function as manager and label executive, Daniel bought the self-help manual Book Your Own Fuckin’ Life. It was a punk-rock venue guide produced by an anarchist collective in Minneapolis. He observed that meaningful implementation of the book was predicated on the possession of a vehicle. He was financially committed to Marmalade Sky to the tune of the eight hundred dollars the first single was going to cost him. There was nothing in his plans about thousands of dollars for transportation. The thought of trying to store a van in Lower Manhattan made his insides droop. Whether or not the street-sweeping machines came, you had to move your car every day. (Official car-theft rates were kept low by the inconvenience of reporting crimes, but a car parked on the street still had annual insurance premiums roughly equal to its value. A worthless car could be relied on to stay put if you removed some vital part such as the alternator every night and took it upstairs.) He broached the necessity of renting a van some weekend to play Trenton or Philly, traditional springboards for ambitious and creative bands that had trouble cracking the mercantile culture of NYC rock. Pam said, “What’s next, Passaic? This city not big enough for you?” Joe elucidated his view that New York was the industry’s one and only mecca. Bands from other places dreamed all their lives of playing there, paying serious money—like fifty bucks—for the privilege of presenting short sets in exploitative clubs such as Downtown Beirut. Marmalade Sky, an endemic growth, could play New York anytime it wanted, by setting up on the sidewalk or next to the fountain in Washington Square. He had seen a rig with a Peavey and a car battery. They could play wearing fun costumes. He had seen a girl dressed as broccoli. “No, no, no,” Daniel said. “I’m not busking for quarters! I have a job!” He noted inwardly that Marmalade Sky’s need for a label and a manager was not urgent and possibly not even real. The band itself might not be real. He felt it might be helpful to know relevant people who could confirm the band’s reality. If, say, he were on speaking terms with someone who booked clubs, or a music journalist. . . he didn’t know how or where to start, but he did have the idea. He resolved to acquire a kick drum and high hat. He wasn’t thinking straight. Pam worked days, and he worked nights. On weekdays they saw each other in the evenings, when she got home from work and he hadn’t left yet—generally from about seven to ten—which was enough time to cook or get takeout, fool around, get cleaned up, and go home to sleep and uptown to work, respectively. On weekends they went to shows. He was losing sleep. When he finally asked her, Pam proffered her habitual disinterested analysis. Of all the factors in their success, she said, there was only one under his control: the debut single, which he should urgently bring to fruition. After it came out, other bands would hound him with demo tapes. For the sake of buttering up a label owner, they would offer Marmalade Sky choice opening gigs. He replied, “I have the money to put out a single, but no band to put on it. Maybe you can tell me when Marmalade Sky is going to start being non-heinous.” “Put up a flyer at Kim’s,” she said. “Or an ad in the Voice. Find some band that has a decent cassette and offer them a seven-inch. Or record Joe as a solo project and let him sell it to his three hundred best friends.” Daniel turned her suggestion over and over in his mind. Joe could play more instruments, and play them better, than all three of them put together. He had no shortage of material. The missing element was the multitrack studio to produce the master tape. Daniel thought briefly of buying microphones and a four-track and learning to use them—or, more realistically, letting Pam figure them out—but the equipment would cost almost as much as pressing the single, and he’d still have to rent a soundproof room to record it in, free from garbage trucks, car stereos, car alarms, and honking, and hire a real producer to oversee the recording and mix it down. Inadvertent technical errors might commit to vinyl the excruciating sound of tape hiss or sixty-cycle hum, making the single too lame to distribute. He said to himself, “Fuck it,” as people often do when deciding to spend money they don’t have. Joe instantly agreed to record a seven-inch with two three-minute songs in a single afternoon. Daniel booked a studio with an engineer in Hoboken, about three months into the future, and paid a deposit of $200. Pam’s period was late. She didn’t want to tell anyone just how late. She and Daniel had had unsafe sex more than once, but it didn’t feel like it counted, because it was such a small fraction of the total sex they’d had. Okay, she admitted to herself: five weeks late. If her period skipped another week, it would be an open-and-shut case. She would need an abortion. She knew that if she told Daniel, he’d offer to pay, and there would go Lion’s Den Records. She had plenty of money. The only way to get an abortion and keep the single was to tell Daniel nothing. He was already in over his head, buying studio time for a friend when he could have pressed a clean master provided for free by strangers. In any case it might already be too late for a black-market poison-pill-style abortion with smuggled RU-486. It would make her sick all weekend, cramping and bleeding until she swore off sex for life, but at least she wouldn’t have to make time for a clinic. She needed to hurry. She’d have to explain being sick to Daniel. Food poisoning, maybe? She would have to come up with what she ate and where. She didn’t feel like rushing into being sick. Besides, the pregnancy might resolve itself unobtrusively. If she skipped the poison pill and stuck to an old-fashioned abortion clinic, she had months left until the third trimester. All she needed was to keep the information away from Daniel until she got organized and found out where they do second-trimester abortions. She was a programmer and a punk, versed in the mortification of the flesh, accustomed to treating her body as a sink and a tool. She was young and inexperienced, not in tune with her own biology and nature. She was not thinking straight. She was not thinking at all. In the corner of D.C.where she grew up, abortions came from Mom. You told your mom you’d been stupid, and she made the relevant appointments. You handed off the thinking to someone else, like a user, not a programmer. Pam didn’t make the appointments. Right around week ten, she grabbed herself by the scruff of the neck, set herself on her feet, and confronted Daniel. She said, “Daniel, I do not feel good.” “Is something wrong?” “I’m pregnant.” “From me? Hey, I don’t know what you get up to after I go to work! Maybe you turn tricks under the viaduct.” “It has your eyes.” “When did you find out?” “I haven’t found out yet. I keep putting it off. I need to get on the stick and do something about it.” “Do you not want a baby?” Seeing her shake her head, he asked, “Is it because of the Art Strike?” “A baby is not creative work!” “Are you sure you don’t want a baby ever in your life? Most people want one sooner or later. Like me. I always assumed I’d have kids someday.” “What are you saying?” “I know we never talked about it, but right now I’m thinking, ‘If not now, when?’ You’d be a total bottom-shelf mother.” (“Bottom-shelf” was positive, since in Midwestern refrigerators the top shelf was where you put the cheap beer for guests to notice when they were making themselves at home.) “And, ‘If not me, then whom?’ ” Pam said. “Random unwed parenting is standard practice back where I come from! We Christians welcome every new Christian soul.” “It’s standard everywhere,” she said, “but not for me. And the reason we never talked about it is that we’ve been dating for maybe four months.” “Obviously,” he said firmly, “abortion makes sense on paper. But I don’t live my life on paper. I would have been happy to know you were pregnant with my child the first time I saw you.” “You’re just weird,” she said. “If we have a kid now, we can be out of the woods at forty. I implore you!” He clasped his hands together pleadingly. “Besides, scheduling an abortion is work, but if you just let it ride, you don’t have to do anything. Which I guess is what you’ve been doing. How far along are you?” “That’s so not true! There’s prenatal care. I have to get sonograms and do Lamaze and La Leche League and turn into my mom. You’re going to love that. Not to mention giving birth and the next eighteen years.” “It’ll be easy. We’re young and healthy.” “I should get a pregnancy test,” she said. “Maybe it’s just ovarian cancer.” In the morning, Daniel called Joe to say he couldn’t afford to record any songs, because he would be needing every cent he had to finance his baby. He would lose the $200 deposit on the recording studio, but that was better than paying the balance. Joe said, “I guess she didn’t tell her parents yet.” “How do you know?” “Because you’re worried about money!” “What do you mean?” “They’re so rich, they live in a house with a yard and trees!” As a native of Wisconsin, Daniel didn’t consider a yard and trees proof of affluence. But that night in bed, resting up before work, he did go so far as to ask Pam to explain Joe’s insinuation. He had always assumed she came from a working-class background similar to his own, if only because she hadn’t finished high school. The news about her pregnancy had prompted him to subordinate his artistic ego to the expense of raising a child. Now he wasn’t so sure. Was it conceivable that fatherhood might improve his finances instead of bankrupting him? She said her dad was a career civil servant with a desk job who planned to retire at sixty. At that point he would commence a second career as a “double dipper,” exploiting his contacts as a defense consultant while drawing half of his former salary. He wasn’t rich, far from it. He made a little under a hundred thousand. In Washington that meant he could have a decent house in a safe part of town, with a wife who didn’t work, living like it was the Sixties. He also had—she said this was the problematic part, for her—a clean conscience, though she knew, or could guess, what he’d been involved in during the Vietnam War. She hadn’t talked to him since she’d left home and had hardly talked to him before that; he was a distant, authoritarian father. “I know you can do math,” Daniel said. “Do you have any idea what a normal person would have to save to retire on fifty thousand dollars a year for life?” “They’re not rich. They’re, like, slow-drip rich. They’re middle class.” “Your parents have zero worries!” “Oh no. I gave them plenty of wrinkles and gray hair.” It sounded like a boast, so she added, “Or maybe it was napalming old people and kids that gave Dad wrinkles and gray hair. I don’t know, and I don’t care.” “What’s your mom like?” “I don’t know. The last time I saw her, she was a stingy, controlling bitch.” “When was that?” “Nineteen eighty-six.” “So call her and find out.” “Call yours first.” “Racine’s a safe distance. You can tell them. Though I guess they might want us to be married.” “I’ll lie. If there’s one thing evangelical Christianity teaches you how to do, it’s lie.” “You can lie? I can’t say I noticed.” “It’s not a skill I get much use out of anymore. Christians unearth the innate lying talent of little kids and hone it like a razor. Like when they ask you to raise your hand in youth group if you’ve ever touched yourself, and then raise your hand if you’ve ever touched a girl.” “So does everybody pick door number two?” “Hell, no! You’d be getting some girl in trouble. The point is to make you feel guilty and trapped. That’s all. It makes you bond with the other Christians, because you’re all telling the same lies together all the time and everybody knows it. It’s like your platoon did a war crime, so now you’re blood brothers.” “Did you raise your hand?” “One time I did raise my hand and say I touched myself, and they acted like I’d come out of the closet. I guess it’s the same thing. My hand touched dick.” “Can’t have that,” Pam said, touching his dick. The initial plan was for Pam somehow to get rid of Simon, so that she and Daniel and the baby could share the one-and-a-half-bedroom apartment in the doorman building. The size was perfect. They might never have to move again. Daniel’s share would be double his current rent, but that would still leave it in manageable territory. It was such an elegant solution that Pam presumed Simon would instantly see their side of the question and vanish from her life, if he had any utilitarian model of ethics whatsoever. He refused to budge. He liked his half-bedroom, which allowed him to live in a fancy apartment in an enviable location without paying Manhattan-style rent. Little Jersey—what the gentrifiers farther east called their part of the West Village—wasn’t chichi; it wasn’t SoHo or TriBeCa; he couldn’t brag that he lived there. It was more of a drinking theme park with shoe stores. But at least it wasn’t a bridge-and-tunnel neighborhood where finding an affordable apartment required reading knowledge of Greek or Polish. He said he’d be happy to look for a new roommate. With that location, so close to the bars, he could basically run auditions and keep interviewing until he found somebody who’d fuck him. The new roommate was guaranteed, he assured Pam, to be a better fuck than her, because she had never been anything special—too cerebral. He advised her to grow some hair, because it’s sensual for men when women have some hair to grab on to. He got what he was aiming for. She left in high distress. She couldn’t imagine spending another night under the same roof with him. In effect, she evicted herself. They rented a U-Haul to do the move a few days later. “Never share an apartment with one person,” Pam told Daniel as he drove. “Always live in a group situation where the total is an odd number, so you can have majority rule.” “That’s a discouraging thing to say to somebody you’re about to move in with,” he said. She reminded him that she was two people. They got married. Of course they got married. The possibility lay there, inducing vertigo, until they did it to get it over with—Daniel for reasons that were primarily romantic, and Pam because marriage made her an ex-Bailey. So they got married, a minor bureaucratic procedure in city hall, downtown, with no special outfits and no party. Joe waited for them outside the building with a bouquet of wilting rosebuds he had bought at a newsstand and warm champagne that got all over his pants when he opened it. He sang a new song to their happiness, sucked the foam from the bottle, and passed it to Pam. Daniel said, “The bride never drinks at a shotgun wedding,” and drank most of it himself. “Kill, kill, kill,” Pam breathed. Daniel thought she was referring in her delirium to Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, but she was attempting a Unix shutdown of the birthing process. Sometimes you have to send the kill command a good number of times. It didn’t work. She kept giving birth. He didn’t leave the room right away. But he had his limits, and one of them was how much pain he could watch her suffer. He tried to stay and even took part in the conversation about attaching a suction cup to the baby’s head. Then he felt dizzy and left to sit down in the lobby. A nurse came out to tell him it was over. He called his parents collect. They congratulated him sincerely. But as much as they treasured the birth of a new soul predestined for heaven or hell, they couldn’t see it as a special occasion. It was routine, in the circles in which they moved, to welcome babies. They’d been wondering where his babies were since around the time he turned twenty. Flora was their ninth grandchild. They promised to send a check for fifty dollars. They invited him to come home sometime and bring his wife and daughter. Pam didn’t call her parents. She didn’t want to hear her mother’s opinion on anything—not on Daniel, not on her decision-making skills, not on her choice of hospital. She’d picked one with a low rate of caesarean sections, and she was regretting it. She’d gotten a touch of fever right toward the end, and her ob-gyn suggested she let them induce labor. She ended up with one giant cramp that went on for seven hours, until they hauled the baby out with the vacuum extraction. It looked as though its birth had involved being thrown from a passing truck, the same figurative truck that had run over her pelvis. Its head was blue from the ears up, crowned with a puffy skin yarmulke for which the technical term was “chignon.” Looking at the baby filled her soul with the fear of death. Within a week she believed that without Daniel, it would not have lived. Without him, she’d be lying facedown drunk on the bed, headphones blasting Black Sabbath. He kept it warm and dry and loved it and brought it to her to feed. After two weeks, to her astonishment, she bounced back. The trauma faded. She regained her appetite. She saw that the baby was cuter than she’d remembered. It looked to her less like a scrap of meat torn from her insides and more like a warm, dry, fluffy little human. She asked Daniel to take a look at her vagina and see whether it too was recognizable as human. She was afraid to use a hand mirror, because it felt like it was in shreds. He said, “Babe, it’s literally identical. Nothing’s changed.” She looked at it herself and found that he was right. She cherished the hope that she might one day be herself again.

        "story": "The Gersons were a fairly unexceptional family. The maid had idly observed them upon their arrival at the Hotel Neversink as she vacuumed the length of the third-floor hallway. The father seemed like a type: late forties, slightly stooped by the punishing mundanity of his work life, clearly some sort of clerical job, as he was too reedy for manual labor and too timid for management or sales. The children were unremarkable, too: an older girl already drawing away from the family, buffered by an invisible wall of brooding solitude; a younger boy who yelled with excitement at nearly everything that happened in this new, fascinating place. The mother, however, was not unexceptional. For one thing, she was enormous. Not just fat—though she was, with ankles and wrists the size of most people’s arms and legs—advancing distantly down the hallway, her chest brought to mind a World War II newsreel clip of a battleship’s prow cutting though the mist. But she was also the tallest woman the maid had ever seen, her low heels and blond bouffant putting her well over six feet. She wore a pale yellow and somewhat shapeless dress, to which she’d pinned a startling brooch. It was red, a sparkling cherry that caught the light of each antique sconce the woman passed. The flashing red light was like a signal, a code aimed at the maid’s weary brain, receptive from seven hours of cleaning. She found she’d stopped vacuuming, was simply standing there in a dull trance, watching Mrs. Gerson until she turned into their room, her family in tow like little vessels caught in a crashing wake. Pushing her vacuum past the closed door, the maid knew she would steal the brooch, and two days later, when the Gersons were down at the pool, she did. She found it in a wooden jewelry box left carelessly by the TV—it was better to think it a careless act than one born of a naïve trust she was presently violating. She lifted it out and held it in both hands, feeling the weight. It winked in the light like a living thing, a thing that somehow knew her mind and her soul, that understood and forgave her weakness, this trespass. She dropped it in her pocket and looked at herself in the mirror, and she felt a tremendous relief, thinking perhaps this is the last time, the last thing. Perhaps now I can stop. The door opened. Mrs. Gerson entered, though it seemed to the maid as though the entire room shifted sideways and expanded to accommodate the woman’s presence. With the survival instinct of a small animal, the maid froze in place, though she couldn’t help glancing at the jewelry box with the foolish hope she’d closed it. She hadn’t. After a long pause, Mrs. Gerson shut the door. She said, “Do you like that?” “What?” “Don’t be stupid—the brooch you were stealing.” “I wasn’t.” “Oh no?” “I wasn’t.” She couldn’t think of anything else to say. Photograph by Stacy Renee Morrison The room slid closer to Mrs. Gerson. The woman pulled off her terry-cloth gown and dropped it on the bed. The one-piece swimsuit she wore was ruffled at the hips and crowned her chest with an outsized, girlish bow. “It’s not worth anything, that’s the sad part. Just cheap costume jewelry. I wouldn’t leave anything valuable out.” “I’m sorry.” The maid tried to edge around her next to the TV, but a minute shift in the woman’s bulk to the left blocked this path of egress. “Could you have thought I wouldn’t notice? What would happen if I reported this?” “I would be fired.” “If not worse.” “Yes. Please don’t tell.” “Why shouldn’t I?” The maid registered the woman’s towering anger now, and how the woman controlled it by assuming a contemplative air, a livid thoughtfulness that felt more dangerous than simple rage. “My son, Isaac. I don’t know what I’d do.” “How old is he?” “Eight. And sick. He has polio.” “So did our president, but Eleanor doesn’t go around stealing jewelry, at least not that I’m aware. Do you think this gives you the right to steal?” “No, I don’t.” The maid began to cry. Mrs. Gerson sighed. “I’m not going to tell. I don’t want your being fired on my conscience.” The maid stood very still, like a small child waiting for punishment to be dispensed. It seemed that if she made herself very still and very small, the enormous woman might forget her and go on with her enormous life. “What’s your name?” said Mrs. Gerson. “Hannah,” said the maid. It felt inappropriate saying it to a guest. “Hannah what?” “Hannah Kohl.” “Hannah Kohl. It’s a pretty name. My name’s Annette. Sounds like Hannah, though I like yours better. Annette Gerson.” “I know.” “Oh?” “I asked at the desk. I was curious. I am curious about guests sometimes.” “Hmm. Do you steal things sometimes?” “No.” “I imagine,” said Mrs. Gerson, sitting on the bed, “that that isn’t entirely true. I imagine items have a way of disappearing from the hotel, from rooms you clean.” It would be a simple matter now, the maid thought, to walk quickly from the room, to finish her chores and return home for the day, and wait for a phone call that she hoped would not come. And might not—after all, Mrs. Gerson had already said she didn’t want to get her fired. But instead she remained rooted to the spot in curious terror. The woman was frightening, and fascinating, and what was truly fascinating was how the woman seemed fascinated by her. “You have the look,” continued Mrs. Gerson, “of a filcher. A guilty little kitten filching fish.” The maid didn’t know what to say to this, so she said nothing. Mrs.Gerson patted the bed for the maid to sit beside her, and she did. “Where are you from, Hannah?” “Poland.” “In the camps?” “No. My father moved us before. He is the hotel owner’s second cousin, from Wroc?aw. The owner helps pay our way, a little. We come in 1938, first to the city but just for two years.” “Then where?” “Then to Monticello, to farm. A few years ago, I come up here, and they give me this job.” The maid sensed that the woman wanted her to speak, so she spoke. She told how they had moved to the country, and how, in high school, she’d met a local boy whom she thought was nice but who wasn’t. How he’d tricked and misused her, getting her drunk on pear cider and taking off her clothes. She couldn’t believe she was telling the woman these things, but they came pouring out of her in a rush, before she had time to think about what she was sharing. She described the pregnancy and her family’s shame, made so much worse when her father had died. Death had eased her father’s shame, but her mother and older sister blamed her for the series of strokes he’d suffered, said she’d killed him. Things had never been the same. She told Mrs. Gerson how things were now, that they helped here and there with Isaac and his illness, but that they considered him tainted. “I see how they look at him, how they talk to him. You know?” “Yes,” said Mrs. Gerson. “I do know.” Now that she was talking, the maid couldn’t stop. She told the woman everything: their tiny home, Isaac’s illness, and the constant worry she had for him—not just the polio but the local children who had disappeared in the past few years, the helpless feeling of something being out there, a fear that sometimes rendered her shamefully glad that her boy was in bed, at home. At night, lying in her cot in the drafty garage apartment, listening to Isaac snoring, she wondered what would happen to him if she wasn’t there. Her son, separated from her now by a thin pasteboard partition, might in some terrible future be separated from her by prison bars or foster care—her nightmares took the form of gray institutions, unclimbable walls enclosing endless queues with a faceless bureaucrat at the end. All because of the stealing! She tried to describe it: the desire that overcame her, the damnable urge that seized her innocent hands—it was like a fever she could not shake, one every bit as persistent as Isaac’s polio. In a state of icy resolve, she managed to get through some days without touching or taking anything. But the next day, or the day after, she would thaw and the need would return and she would find herself dropping something or other, another small item of shame and relief, into her uniform’s pouch, as she had been doing a few minutes before when Mrs. Gerson had walked in on her. “You poor thing,” said Mrs. Gerson. “You’re a kleptomaniac.” “What is this word?” “The urge to steal. It’s a condition, I have to imagine, related to your experiences, and to anxiety about your son. You must be so frightened.” “Yes,” said the maid, suddenly crying again, now ashamed of how much she had told this stranger. Without warning, Mrs. Gerson reached over and thrust her hand deep into the pocket of the maid’s apron. The maid stiffened, but the woman pulled out the forgotten brooch. “Now then,” said Mrs. Gerson, holding the pin in front of herself as though she were speaking to it. “We leave in two days, but I want to help you. I will set up an appointment for your son to be seen by our physician. It sounds as though—what was his name?” “Isaac.” “—Isaac has not been receiving adequate care.” She put the brooch back in its box and shut the lid. “You will both stay with us in the city. I’ll leave the details for you at the front desk.” She put her robe back on and laid a heavy hand on the maid’s shoulder. “I’ll see you soon, Hannah.” The trip into Manhattan lasted nearly all day, though they left home in the violet cold. Simply walking to the bus stop in town took nearly an hour, with Isaac having to stop several times to rest. The maid wanted to carry him—it would have been easier—but even at eight, the child was willful and proud, and he would not allow himself to be carried like a baby. They edged along on the narrow shoulder of the road, shrinking into themselves as the occasional truck yawned by, heedless in the waking dark. From downtown Liberty, it was a two-hour ride to Newburgh and across the Hudson, then another hour waiting for the next train to New York. Seated on the wooden bench in the small station, they passed a bag of stale peanuts back and forth. These she’d taken from the hotel kitchen pantry in anticipation of the trip—theft, too, though not in the same spirit as her theft from guests. Peering down the long canal of bent trees from which their train was due to emerge, Isaac said, “What are they going to do to me?” “Nothing. Give you a good checkup.” The truth was, the maid had no idea, and even suspected the trip was a bad idea. But staring at the note Mrs. Gerson had left her, in its swooping hand—a hand as outsized and lavish as its owner—she hadn’t felt she’d had a choice. The woman could still turn her in, if she wanted; a guest’s complaint, particularly a charge of theft, knew no statute of limitations and would be investigated by the hotel detective, a young, talkative, balding man named Mr. Javits who occupied a permanent room in the maid’s personal mansion of fears. Further, looking at her son’s frail chest, the thin arms she could easily encircle with her hand as Mrs. Gerson had encircled her own, she knew he did need help. The doctor her mother had dug up was some elder in their country synagogue, a morose, half-blind graybeard who’d presented neither credentials nor, indeed, any evidence he knew what he was talking about. Polio, he said, would usually clear up and go away on its own. Plenty of bed rest and fluids. Now, nearly a half year of bed rest and fluids later, and having fallen behind in school, her son was still shuffling around in stained pajamas, eerily similar to her father shortly before his death. Mrs. Gerson may have been frightening, but all the same, perhaps she could help. Mitzvahs came in all forms. The train arrived as though summoned by the coughing spell that bent Isaac double. They just made it to their appointment at Beth Israel, and the maid sat in the waiting room for two hours picking through magazines while Isaac was being examined. She put one in her bag, a Life magazine with Mickey Mantle on the cover, the pages so greasy and worn it didn’t even seem like stealing. Finally, she was ushered into a consultation room where her son sat slumped in a metal chair, exhausted. The doctor was a large, hale man, with a coxcomb of thinning red hair. He shook her hand and said, “Annette sent you here, right?” “Yes.” “Well, I’m glad she did. Your son needs some attention to repair the damage caused by the poliomyelitis. He’ll be all right, I think, but we need to do more tests, and he could use some physical therapy.” “When?” “If you could come down twice a month, that would be ideal. Probably over the next year or so.” “I don’t have the money.” The doctor smiled. “It’s taken care of. The Gersons are friends.” The Gersons’ apartment was in a large building several blocks west of Central Park. Neither the maid nor her son had ever ridden in an elevator, and they watched together in minor disbelief as the lighted numbers ticked upward. Mrs. Gerson greeted them after a single knock. The woman appeared smaller in her natural habitat than she had at the hotel, still huge, but somehow diminished. The cavernous apartment was filled with books—seemed, to the maid, to be overflowing with them. The husband was as benign in person as he’d been in the hotel hallway. He accepted the maid and her son’s shuffling presence with an amused tolerance that suggested his wife was forever doing mercurial things like inviting over hotel staff. He put their suitcase in the guest room, which contained a small bed and a cot, then ushered them back into the large living room, where he sat reading in an armchair, his tan cardigan blending into the wallpaper. The muted sounds of the Gerson children came through the walls so softly as to seem almost imagined; in the maid’s little apartment back in Liberty, such privacy was unthinkable, and even bathroom noises trumpeted with force and immediacy. Mrs. Gerson asked whether Isaac wanted to meet her children. When he said no, she smiled and took him by his thin shoulder, dispatching him reluctantly into the playroom, as she called it. The sounds became even more muted, then silent. In the playroom there was very little playing. The Gerson children seemed to regard Isaac as an annoying nuisance foisted upon them. The girl, like her father, sat reading in a slightly oversized chair. The boy was engrossed in his collection of marbles, which he pulled from a small velvet sack one by one and lined up in a floorboard crack, appraising them with the practiced eye of a 47th Street jeweler. Isaac sat on the bed, looking at his hands, searching for something to say to them, some shared entry point. “Your family came to the hotel.” “Yes,” said the girl without looking up. “My mother works there.” “She’s a maid,” said the boy. Isaac detected no judgment in the boy’s flat, factual tone. “Yes.” “We’re rich,” added the boy. Isaac coughed, and his chest tingled like a thousand hot pins pushed in. He said, “A boy disappeared there.” The girl looked up from her book. “What?” “He did. From the hotel, a few years ago. And another one in town last year.” Pleasingly, he had their attention now. A disappeared child was interesting; children disappearing from a place where they went every year was fascinating. In extravagant and largely secondhand or otherwise outright imagined detail, Isaac went into a description of the search for the latest child—the distraught mother’s breakdown, the police combing the woods with bloodhounds pulling at leashes, random lie detector tests, and the warning at his school not to talk to strangers (which was real). The boy said, “Who do you think it is?” Isaac shrugged. An instinctive storyteller, he knew that, having grabbed their attention, it was now time to shut the flow of information down to a slow drip. “Come on,” said the girl. “Can you keep a secret?” The Gerson children nodded. Isaac looked toward the closed door and said, “It’s a ghost.” “Bull,” said the girl. “Ghosts aren’t real.” “I saw one walking home last year.” “Bull,” she said with less conviction, leaning forward. So he told them about it: the time a year ago, walking to the Neversink from school, when he was still going to school, the light he’d seen in the woods near the hotel. A strange, yellow-orange light, like glimpsing something deep underwater—he’d approached to see what it was, and there, in the shadows of the trees, was a pale, unearthly figure: the ghost. His body seemed to be glowing, and in that light Isaac had seen the look in his eyes, the wave saying join me, the smile that was not a smile. Isaac retreated and the ghost took a step forward. Isaac stopped and the ghost stopped, as if imitating him. When he walked farther along the path, the ghost followed in the woods, keeping pace. At last, Isaac had broken into a run on his aching legs, and reached the hotel in an exhausted hobble. Panting at the top of the hill, he scanned the dark woods below and saw nothing. Had he imagined it? But then, as if in answer, a dull glow throbbed somewhere deep in the darkness—once, twice, and then it was gone. “Whoa,” said the Gerson girl. “Did you tell your mother?” “No. I wasn’t scared.” It was, of course, as the Gerson girl put it, bull. He’d been scared, but he hadn’t wanted to worry his mother even more than she already was. Anyway, it was a different, better kind of scared than usual, this ghost-story kind of scared. Most of the scary things in his life were sad and real. His polio, the feeling of walking through a swimming pool at all times. The sorrow in his mother’s face, the look that told him everything was certainly not all right, no matter how many times she said it was. “Come on, tell us more,” said the boy. From the other room, Mrs. Gerson’s barking laughter erupted, and the children momentarily paused. This reminder of the adult world outside the walls amplified the playroom’s cozy secrecy. “I’ll tell you more,” whispered Isaac. “For a marble. That one.” He pointed at a big blue galaxy with sparkles in it. The Gerson boy shrugged and rolled it across the uneven floor to a crack by Isaac’s knee, where it seemed to sit and listen to its new owner speak. The Gerson woman poured them both another glass of whiskey, ignoring the maid’s demurral. It hurt the maid’s throat and tasted like burning dirt, but it dampened the strangeness of the evening, so she drank it down while doing her best to explain the doctor’s report. Mrs. Gerson nodded knowingly. “I was right,” she said, “he did need looking at.” “Yes. The doctor says he can get back to normal with good care.” “I’m so happy to hear that.” And she did seem happy. The husband had earlier excused himself to some get-together at a friend’s—he was vague on the subject. When he’d left, Mrs. Gerson had relaxed, become vociferous and mastering, and seemed to expand to her previous size. The maid was sitting by the woman on a large, hard settee, and a corner lamp lit the room soft and orange, like sunlight in autumn coming through the hotel’s windows as she cleaned. An opera record was playing, a little loudly—“Maria Callas,” read the album cover. “Thank you,” she said as the thick, smoky tendrils of the whiskey reached down deep into her legs, still sore from the week’s work. This woman from whom she’d tried to steal had been so kind to her. No one had ever been so kind. “Come here,” said Mrs. Gerson. She took the maid’s hand and drew her over next to her. She encircled the maid’s small waist and pulled her down onto her lap. The maid fit comfortably there. It reminded her of before she’d become large with Isaac, reading in her father’s overstuffed easy chair—a time when everything was easy, happy, and simple. Mrs. Gerson stroked her head. The maid became aware, after a time, that the woman was stroking other parts of her: her back, her leg, the side of her breast through the wool tunic. The combination of her feelings at this moment—shame, fear, comfort at the huge embrace, and alarm at the woman’s falconing hands—created such a potent mix as to be paralytic, and so she stiffened and sat, and waited for whatever was happening to finish happening, for Mrs. Gerson to release her and make clear what would happen next. Mrs. Gerson ran her fingers over the maid’s reclined body as though she were some kind of musical instrument with an infinitude of taut and twanging strings. And she did seem to sing out in musical response along with the scratchy record, a quiet virtuoso aria with quick runs, basso grunts of protest ascending to shocked soprano squeals, all with her dark eyes shut tight. Mrs. Gerson put her hand on the maid’s crotch and began rubbing in a circular motion. The maid cried out in revulsed pleasure for the woman to stop, ah please stop, but Mrs. Gerson did not stop. Finally, hearing his mother’s distressed moans, Isaac padded out half-asleep and stood swaying on the creaky hardwood floor. The maid twisted toward her son. Mrs. Gerson set the maid back on the couch like a piece of furniture that needed rearranging and then, with great dignity, rose and disappeared down the hallway. Twice a month, they made the trip to New York, and twice a month, the episodes, as the maid thought of them, with Mrs. Gerson occurred. She loathed the woman’s touch and afterward felt physically ill, but Isaac was improving quickly. The fact that she was submitting to this treatment in order, in turn, to facilitate her son’s seemed to expiate the inherent sin, as well as (she hoped) the odd and uncontrollable shivers of pleasure she sometimes felt. Early on, she managed to avoid these episodes by excusing herself to bed early, but the next day Mrs. Gerson would be hostile and distant, and she feared the disappearance of the woman’s largesse. Mrs. Gerson never mentioned the episodes, which helped to cordon them off in the maid’s mind. They seemed unconnected to anything else. And the fact was that she liked Mrs. Gerson. The woman was funny and bold, said what was on her mind, and seemed genuinely interested in her and Isaac’s welfare. If she was simply using the maid for deviant pleasure, holding her hostage by way of her son’s health, as the maid, lying in her own small bed after a trip to the city, sometimes felt was the case, then why all the extra kindnesses? Why take them shopping at Bloomingdale’s? Why send her home with a book entitled Mrs.Dalloway that Mrs. Gerson wanted to discuss the next time they came up? Was it simply guilt? It didn’t seem so—the woman confided in the maid, asking for her opinion about things like a new sweater she’d bought, wallpaper she was picking out to brighten the stuffy oak of the dining room. Mrs. Gerson’s motives were irrelevant, though, considered next to Isaac’s miraculous improvement. The maid watched proudly from their window as he played ball in their yard with two of the neighborhood boys, flagging a little at times, limping a bit, but keeping up. Traveling down to his April checkup, patches of weeds and blooming wildflowers pushed through the gray snow, and post-examination, the doctor said maybe one more visit over the summer. The boy was almost normal, according to benchmarks. “How wonderful,” said Mrs. Gerson when the maid reported these developments. They were sitting at the dining-room table, a bottle of wine between them. As usual, Mr. Gerson had politely excused himself after dinner. Mrs. Gerson wore a red dress with long sleeves, her blond hair held back by a polka-dot headband. She looked disconcertingly like a little girl, an impression magnified by her unusually bashful manner. “I suppose this means you won’t be visiting anymore.” “Well,” said the maid, “the doctor wants to see him in June.” “Yes, of course.” Mrs. Gerson drank her wine, and the maid saw she was holding back tears. “We can visit.” “No, that’s okay.” She put the glass down and looked around the apartment. “Have I ever told you,” she said, “that everything here is Bert’s?” “No.” “Yes, everything you see. Including me, really. He’s quite a wealthy man. His family owns the supermarket chain. He’s rich now; when his father dies, he’ll be incredibly rich. The children will never need to work, probably to their detriment.” “I always thought you had the money.” “Yes, people think that, but I don’t have anything. My family is as poor as yours.” They sat in thick silence broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall and, outside, the distant sound of traffic, the intimation of other people’s lives. Mrs. Gerson said, “People wonder why me, and I used to wonder that myself, when we met. I was on scholarship at Radcliffe while he was at Harvard. He could have had anyone, and he always knew I liked girls better.” “He knows?” “Oh yes,” she said dismissively, as though the question was stupid. “It’s an arrangement, like all marriages. I gave him the children. I raise them, I take care of his affairs, in all senses. Bert just wants things to be easy. He always wanted a mother more than a wife.” The maid didn’t know what to say. She looked at her knee, covered in dark, worn hose, now covered by the woman’s broad hand. Mrs. Gerson said, “The thing with wives is they can leave. Mothers can’t.” She embraced the maid, and for the first time, kissed her full on the mouth, a deliberate and probing kiss, as though the woman were trying to extract information from some secret recess. “I love you,” she said. The maid rose from her seat, went to the guest room, and roused Isaac. He put on his clothes sleepily, but without too much resistance. The maid tossed all their clothes into their broken suitcase and fastened it shut with a piece of string tied to the handle. Mrs. Gerson remained where she’d been sitting, at the table, watching them as they left. The elevator expelled them into the lobby, the nodding doorman held the heavy oak and brass door open, and the city night gathered them both into its cool embrace. Walking briskly to the nearby train station, she smiled at her son’s strong gait, the simple pleasure she felt striding along beside him. For the first time in as long as she could remember, she felt free, truly free. They would not be back in June, or ever. But a month later, the hotel’s owner, Mrs. Sikorsky, called the maid into her office, a small room on the second floor near the cleaning supply closet. It wasn’t where you would expect the owner of a thriving resort to work—a nook lit by one small window and dominated by a rusted-green filing cabinet that occupied half the space—but it was where she’d always worked, from the beginning, and her stubborn occupation of the room was taken by all the staff as a symbol of her humble diligence. The maid had been there only once, years earlier, when she was hired—Mrs. Sikorsky, she remembered vividly, had shared tea with her from a silver samovar, and a plate of sugar cookies, asking after their shared relatives in Wroc?aw. She was a friendly woman with ash-blond hair framing a face as habitually open as the fields that surrounded her hotel. This made her demeanor all the more frightening when she brusquely waved the maid in. It took the maid a moment to notice, beside the filing cabinet, Mr. Javits. He tapped a pen against his foot and looked at the maid mildly, and she knew what was about to happen. “You are being let go, Hannah.” “Why?” “Why, she asks,” said Mrs. Sikorsky, casting a sideways look at Mr. Javits. “A guest said you took something from their room.” “But what?” She was shaking. She hadn’t stolen anything since Mrs.Gerson’s brooch. “Never mind that. It corresponds with a couple of other incidents.” Mr. Javits said, “I made some calls, Hannah. A pattern has been established. We knew someone was taking things for a while, but we didn’t have corroborating proof until now.” “But my son.” Mrs. Sikorsky looked at her, and Hannah tried one last, desperate ploy that made her ill as she spoke the words. “We are family.” Mrs. Sikorsky said, “And I consider everyone here family.” She shook her head. “I’ve never fired anyone before. Even if you stole from me, I would not have fired you. But from the guests—” Here she trailed off, the thought too much to contemplate. “Come back in three days and pick up your severance check, which I hope you know you’re lucky to get.” And with a wave of her hand, the maid was dismissed. On the walk home, down uneven gravel shoulders, the sun burned the top of her head like the heat of her own shame. She thought about striking out, somewhere far enough away that they wouldn’t hear about this. Then she thought about Isaac at school, doing well—his teacher said he might skip a grade, even after the school he’d missed—playing with the other kids until dark every day. Outside their apartment, she picked up Isaac’s baseball from the grass—the once unblemished white surface now tan and tattered. She thought about seeing whether her mother would take him in but balked at the idea. She heard Mrs. Gerson’s voice in her mind: A wife can leave; a mother can’t. Later that night, after she’d tucked Isaac in and waited for the raspy snore to issue from his side of the divider, she crept across the kitchen’s complaining floorboards to the hall closet. Here lived her secret shame—opening the door and gazing upon the objects she’d stolen over the years was like standing before her own wretched soul. She picked up armful after armful of stolen possessions and brought them downstairs. Half an hour of this silent labor saw everything transferred to a pile in the yard. She doused it with kerosene and watched it burn: the shoes, the books, the socks and nylons and frillies, an Indian change purse marked with a branded symbol, a letter from someone’s daughter away at college, a Polaroid photo of a young woman smiling beneath a white tree in the hotel courtyard, a pack of breath mints, a miniature boomerang, several different fishing lures hand-painted in primary colors, a pair of broken glasses, a pair of unbroken glasses, an old Life magazine with Igor Stravinsky on the cover, three different yarmulkes, and even a Torah. Even the stolen Torah, she burned. “Mama?” Isaac stood behind her, his face made briefly visible by a licking flame. “What are you doing?” She looked at the flames and found she had no reply. He stood by her. “What are you burning?” “Things I have stolen.” “Why did you steal them?” “Because of you, because I was afraid. But you’re better now. No more stealing, ever.” The boy went back inside the house. When he returned, he threw the marbles he’d taken from the Gerson boy on the flames. Comet, sunburst, Indian blanket, galaxy: they popped and fizzed and turned black in the heat. She went back to the Hotel Neversink for her check, though she’d vowed not to return. It had been a hollow vow; they had to eat. She found a message waiting for her from a Manhattan exchange. The desk clerk politely absented himself into the coffee shop to give her privacy. “How horrible,” the woman’s voice boomed in response to the news of her termination. “Yes. I was reported.” “How horrible,” she repeated. “Well, perhaps this is kismet. Mr. Gerson and I have just been discussing the need for a live-in nanny. I have so much to do, and only so much time—” she went on, but the maid was only half-listening, aware of herself as a guest watching might have been aware of her: a slight woman in a sweater and long skirt and cheap brown shoes, shoulders shaking, bent over the desk in a posture of utter submission.

        "story": "“Thank you for the honor. I am very—honored.” You have been instructed to remove the clumsy black mortarboard at this point in the commencement ceremony. Now you incline your head so that a red ribbon bearing a brass medallion inscribed with the Latin phrase vincit omnia veritas can be looped around your neck. Then a royal-blue velvet doctoral hood with white satin trim is also lowered over your head and secured in place around your shoulders with a snap. A rotund little man identified as the president of the college congratulates you, shakes your hand vigorously. You are left alone at the podium, smiling foolishly. Applause. Not a thunderous applause but polite, even warm, you choose to think. You adjust the medallion, which falls heavily onto your breastbone. You stare out into the audience of expectant young faces as pale and translucent as sea anemones. “ . . . an honor, and a pleasure . . . this celebratory occasion. . . ” You have not died. You have been invited to receive an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the community college near your old hometown in upstate New York. In exchange, you are obliged to deliver the commencement address to several hundred black-robed graduates seated on bleachers on a playing field sodden from recent showers. It is a chill pale day of cirrus clouds, a capricious wind borne southward from Lake Ontario. High overhead, with ominous frequency, fighter jets pass in formation. You express gratitude that the planes are on our side, but the joke, if that’s what it is, falls flat, or is muffled by the jets’ roaring; on the commencement stage behind you there is a polite sort of laughter from your hosts, but few among the graduates join in. No doubt they have grown so accustomed to fighter jets in the sky above the college—and their homes—that they no longer hear them. The graduates are a practical lot who have earned degrees in such subjects as education, hotel management, nursing, business administration, engineering, communication arts, forestry, animal husbandry. You are obliged to speak louder, to be heard over the dull roar of the jets. You confide in the graduates that you have not been invited to the region of your birth to receive a degree, to give a lecture, to read from a new book or even to sign books, since you left thirty-six years ago. And so this commencement ceremony is indeed a significant event in your life. Wittily you say to your audience: “I am very grateful to my hosts for inviting me, after thirty-six years! I hope that in another thirty-six years they will invite me back again.” But this remark, too, falls flat. Your audience stares at you with baffled smiles. Chagrined, you return to your written speech. In the bleachers directly before you are the graduates of the college in their somber dark robes and mortarboards; behind them, and flanking them, are rows of guests—families, friends, visitors from the community. All of them gaze at you in silence. You had intended to speak in abstract terms of the value of a college education, but instead you speak of your childhood in the small city of Yewville nine miles away. You speak of the gratitude you feel for your teachers, some of whom are still living in the vicinity, though long retired. You speak of your family, most of whom are deceased. You speak of the beautiful rolling hills of western New York State, the stark glacial formations, the prevailing winds of this harsh landscape south of Lake Ontario. You speak of the public library in Yewville, where you’d spent so many hours as a young person. You are wiping at your eyes. You feel as if you might burst into tears. The audience has become very quiet. Uncomfortable at witnessing such unfeigned emotion, in such circumstances. Nor are you comfortable out of your role, for you are the most calibrated of persons. Soon, then, you conclude your speech. Your voice cracks, you feel you must apologize. There is a moment’s silence—an awkward silence. Then, an outburst of applause. The response from the graduates is especially warm, enthusiastic. Here and there individuals rise to their feet, applauding. For a dazed moment you think—Do I know them? But it is decades later; these are not your classmates. Moved by gratitude, you think—Am I home, at last? Is this where I belong? After the commencement luncheon you are brought in a hired car to the small city of your birth nine miles away. At the luncheon you’d accepted the congratulations of college officials who claimed that they had never experienced graduates reacting so enthusiastically to any commencement speaker before. Wonderful how you connected with our graduates! Born here, went to school here, evoked the time and the place so we all had tears in our eyes. . . Yet, as soon as you are alone in the rear of the hired car, headed for Yewville, the familiar landscape of your past drifts by silent as a dream and you find yourself transfixed with longing. You’d intended to work on the drive. Such spare moments are valuable to you, you dare not waste them. In your lap your notebook lies untouched except for a single sentence that you will discover after you return home from Yewville, without remembering that you’d written it: So little has changed, her temptation is to believe that she herself has not changed. Farmland, rolling hills to the horizon. Glacial formations: drumlins, troughlike ridges in the soil, small mountains covered in deciduous trees. The roughened landscape looks as if it has been scraped with a great trowel, mirrored by similarly roughened clouds overhead, now covering most of the sky. There is a heightened wind from Lake Ontario, only just visible, a faint hazy blue in the distance. Then, a long descent. Ahead is the Yewville River, as narrow and scintillant in the sun as a snake’s scales, and the Yewville Valley, famous for its thousands of acres of orchards: peaches, pears, apples. A two-lane wrought-iron bridge, scarcely changed since you saw it last. A blacktop state highway formerly two lanes, now three. Farmhouses, orchards. Grazing pastures: Holsteins, horses. Names of roads you haven’t recalled in decades that stir your heart like fragments of dreams. Entering Yewville on the highway you see the old water tower silhouetted above the city. Now it has been defaced with graffiti, savage red initials, cryptic signs, familiar boasts—class of 2018 overwriting class of 2017. Graduating seniors from Yewville High have had a tradition of climbing the tower on the serpentine ladder, ignoring warning signs, boldly spray-painting their names, initials, class years on the metallic side of the tower. Every few years the water tower is power-cleaned of old fading graffiti, and a new generation climbs the serpentine ladder to make their claim. You don’t want to recall the year you’d graduated from high school. Long ago in the previous century. . . In the year you’d graduated, one of the (drunken) senior boys who’d climbed the water tower had fallen to his death. Not a friend of yours, though his name is indelibly imprinted in your memory: Jamie Haas. Useless memories, yet precious. Virtually every name of every classmate of yours from elementary school through graduation is imprinted in your brain. You don’t want to speculate how many of your classmates have vanished, how few probably remain in Yewville, and of these how few will remember you and come to your presentation at the library this afternoon. There you will be honored for the second time today, as Yewville’s “most distinguished literary figure.” So far as you know there has never been any other writer from Yewville, literary or otherwise. Driving along Main Street, you are stirred by memories of shopping in these stores with your mother and your grandmother when you’d been a young girl. Led along the aisles of Yewville’s premier department store, Schulyer Brothers. The feel of a warm, firm adult hand gripping yours. Disappointed to see that Schulyer Brothers, with its shiny onyx-black facade, has vanished and in its place is an office building with a dull stucco facade. What a loss! Vividly you recall the interior of the grand old store: high, hammered-tin ceilings, brass lighting fixtures, floor tiles of a dark, dusty rose marble. . . Farther along Main Street you see that Sears, Roebuck has vanished as well. Flanagan’s Shoes is gone, replaced by a nail salon. Where Brewer’s restaurant was once, there is Main Street Grill. Where South Main Books was once, a vacated space with for rent/for sale signs in the dusty front window. But the Palace Theater remains, if somewhat shabby, and with a marquee advertising a local fire sale. The Empire Building, a dour twelve-floor office building invariably smelling inside of something sickish-sweet like ether, where you’d endured years of dentist and doctor appointments, remains at the end of the street like a totem of a bygone era. The Mohigan Street bridge. And beneath the bridge, a pedestrian walkway along the river that is no longer maintained by the city and has been allowed to crumble. Rusted girders, broken concrete in vacant lots. A girl, so small, frightened—what was her name?—in sixth grade, poorly dressed, snarled hair, hounded by boys, screaming for them to let her alone. A girl with tight kinky hair, wet dark eyes, a girl with whom you’d sometimes walked to school, but you have forgotten her name. . . Olive? Olivia? An unusual name. . . But no, you have forgotten. So much to forget, in Yewville. But you are recalling how, by the time you were in high school, less than twelve miles from Niagara Falls, Yewville was discovered to have been contaminated by hazardous waste materials from that stricken city. Downwind from Niagara Falls, Yewville was vulnerable to airborne toxins as well as seepage into the local water supply. Incidents of lead poisoning in very young children, an unnatural number of cancers, including leukemia, in the general population. Yet you recall happy times. Sunday drives along the cliff above Lake Ontario, picnics on the rough-pebbled beach with your family. Visiting your grandmother after school in her house on Amsterdam Street. Butternut cookies, pumpkin pie with whipped cream. In winter, hot chocolate with melted marshmallows. Life seemed to have unfolded in Yewville without incident, like a Möbius strip that turns with almost imperceptible slowness, the long summers stretching to the very horizon. Now your life passes with alarming rapidity. Each year is an acceleration. The future: a mirror in which you see no reflection. Impulsively you ask your driver to take a brief detour, past your old middle school—DeWitt Clinton. (As a child, you’d never even known who DeWitt Clinton was. A New York State politician responsible for the construction of the Erie Canal.) On Amsterdam, a few blocks from where your grandmother lived—where she’d rented the upper half of a gray-shingled wood-frame house to be near the school for the three years you’d attended it. Passing the house in which your grandmother lived decades ago, you feel a sensation of profound loss, yet also elation—for you’d been loved once, cherished. The old school has been renovated. Beige brick, stucco. Except for a wide expanse of patchy lawn in front, it resembles a small-parts factory. You wait to feel something but can’t even remember which door you’d entered. Who were your closest friends, with whom you walked to school. Abigail? Lorraine? Not Olive—or was it Olivia. . . Back on Main Street the driver is again required to detour, routed around a pedestrian mall. Here is an innovation for Yewville—a street without vehicles. Stunted trees, evergreen shrubs in pots, pastel-colored benches, a small (dry) fountain. The mall is only a block long and resembles a stage set composed of cheap materials. Several stores appear to be shuttered, for rent signs in windows. Not many shoppers, not many pedestrians. Are those people homeless? A truculent-looking woman in an oversize coat, knit cap pulled down over a bald scalp, beside a grocery-store cart heaped with her possessions. You feel a twinge of panic—is this woman someone you know, or who knows you? A former classmate, a neighbor? A relative? But no. Most of your relatives are gone. It is a curious thing to realize that you are not relative to anyone any longer. The driver of the hired car has been surreptitiously turning up the radio volume. Raucous hip-hop music is just audible, breaking your concentration on the drive. You would ask the driver to turn down the radio, or better yet turn it off, but hesitate to offend him, at least until you are on your way back to the airport at Buffalo. It is the stately old Yewville Public Library to which you have been brought, to give a presentation and book signing. The head librarian, with whom you have been in correspondence, has spoken warmly to you of your many Yewville fans. But as you climb out of the limousine you are overcome by a sensation of dismay, despair powerful as vertigo. Yes, the Yewville library is virtually unchanged—a dignified sandstone building in the Greek Revival style. For what does Yewville mean to you without your mother, your father, your grandmother? It is true that their spirits seem to dwell here—in the very air, heavy with moisture—yet there is no denying the blunt, crude fact that they are gone. And what does Yewville mean without your closest friends, Abigail, Lorraine, Beth? The boy you’d (secretly) liked, a particular friend of yours in math class, what was his name—Roland Kidd? You’d heard a decade ago that Roland had been stricken with a terrible neurological disease that had paralyzed his legs. You’d heard that he had died. . . You give instructions to the driver: you will be inside the library approximately one hour. Then you will rejoin him, and he will drive you to the Buffalo airport as planned. Your single suitcase is in the trunk of the car. Your flight departs at 6:46 pm, and you do not intend to miss it. You do not want to spend a second night in this place! So many people are gone from your life. And especially here in Yewville, where (contrary to your wishful thinking) time has not ceased but moves at the same accelerating pace as elsewhere. No idea what the lives were of those whom you’d known here. No idea what has become of them, where they have vanished to. The teachers who’d praised you and imagined great things for you as if (wistfully, grandiloquently) speaking of themselves. Bearing you aloft on their wounded, faltering wings. Lighting a roadway for you with the uplifted torches of their hope, now gone. All those lives, those particular persons, their mannerisms, habits of speaking, smiling, all vanished, erased, unreal, and lacking immediacy. What is immediate is the corrugated tin-colored sky, which hurts your eyes, and a V-formation of planes passing high overhead, the grating radio music to which your driver will listen as soon as you leave him. What is immediate is your hand being shaken by a stranger—so often these days, a stranger—and your courteous robot response: “Oh yes. Thank you! I am honored to be here, too. . . ” But there has been a change in plans, you are informed. In fact, your presentation at the Yewville library has been canceled. Indeed, a yellow band with rude black letters canceled has been taped over a poster announcing your visit, displayed at the front entrance of the library. The “N” obliterates your face in a grainy photograph from years ago. You are too surprised to be indignant, hurt, or even relieved. You ask why your presentation has been canceled, even as you suppose it would be better not to ask, better not to know. It seems that the library felt obliged to cancel your event because more people were expected than the library could accommodate safely. The terms “fire code” and “fire marshal” are uttered with an air of finality. You listen in disbelief. The head librarian who’d written such gracious letters to you is not here to explain. Instead, an assistant librarian has taken her place. With a look of mild vexation the woman informs you that a few people have showed up after all to meet you, so you can sign books for them in a back room—“If you are up to it. We understand you are probably exhausted after your travels.” You protest—you are not exhausted at all! You have come to Yewville instead of returning home immediately after the commencement because you’d looked forward to the visit, and had been assured that there were readers of your books here who were eager to meet you. How petulant you sound, like a hurt child! And how nasal your voice in your ears, as if in mimicry of the western New York State accent you have been hearing since your arrival the previous day. The assistant librarian listens to you politely. She introduces herself as Marian Beattie, as if this were a name that might mean something to you. The woman is middle-aged, stout, somewhat disheveled, with a doughy, oddly familiar face. Her bulky pantsuit is a wry cranberry color, in a fabric as synthetic as vinyl; her feet appear to be swollen, in bandagelike socks worn with open-toed sandals. Behind bifocals her eyes are blurry with moisture and a kind of malicious merriment. She exudes an air of ashy, unlaundered clothes, stained underarms. How disappointed you are! You realize that you must have been anticipating this visit to Yewville with something like—hope? For it was here, long ago, that the elusive emotion was first kindled in your soul. Soon short of breath, panting and puffing, and walking with difficulty on her bandaged feet, Marian Beattie leads you into the interior of the library. You see that it has been altered considerably since your girlhood, with an eye to the practical and utilitarian. The ceilings are no longer so magisterially high. The floor is obviously not marble but inexpensive tile meant to resemble marble. The chandeliered lights you recall have been replaced by tubes of ugly fluorescent lights that flicker as if on the verge of extinction. “We’re particularly proud of our computer reference room,” Marian Beattie tells you. What had been the reading room, one of the happy places of your life, has been transformed into a hall for computers. Three long tables, six computers at each table—rapidly you calculate eighteen computers for the relatively small Yewville library. At these are a few adults, mostly older men with sad, slack faces, and long-limbed teenagers scrolling through websites. No one glances at you in the doorway. You recall how in this room, on shelves reaching to the ceiling, were books designated as Classics—tall, illustrated books that did not circulate like most library books but were required to be read in the library, at one of the long polished tables, or in one of the leather chairs in a corner of the room. Naively, as a girl you’d tried to read Dante’s Divine Comedy, Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, even Plato’s Republic. Even Plato’s Great Dialogues. You smile to think of how little you must have grasped of these great works, like a child trying to climb a stone wall by the desperate effort of her small fingers, her weak muscles. Now the shelves of Classics have vanished, presumably into another region of the library. With a condescending smile Miss Beattie leads you to the small room at the rear of the library where “fans” have gathered—fewer than a dozen people seated on folding chairs that look as if they have been hastily set up. Most of these are older individuals and one is in a wheelchair, formally attired in a tweed jacket, head crooked to one side with an expression of acute interest. Many are carrying books, presumably yours. In the front row is a middle-aged, frizzy-haired woman leaning far forward on her knees, staring at you so intensely that her face is furrowed with fine white lines. In a bemused nasal voice Miss Beattie introduces you by saying that you need no introduction. There is a smattering of applause. No podium here, no place to stand except awkwardly at the front of the room. You are far more uneasy here than you’d been at the commencement that morning, on a stage facing hundreds of people. Hesitantly, you greet your audience. Your modesty is not feigned. You are very, very self-conscious. You cannot not see eyes fastened upon you or, worse yet, drifting downward to your feet, rising to your face, as you stammer that you are “very honored,” “very excited” to be back in your hometown after thirty-six years. You decide not to explain why you are in the vicinity of Yewville. Calling attention to the fact that you’d received an honorary doctorate in humane letters from the community college would seem at once boastful and pathetic, and there would be the bewilderment—what are humane letters? A poster in the corridor claims that the Yewville Public Library was to have hosted a “conversation with Yewville’s best-selling author”—not “most distinguished literary figure” after all—this afternoon, and so at once several hands are raised in the audience. You are asked where you get your ideas and how old you were when you published your first story. Do you make an outline for a novel beforehand or “just start writing”? You are asked whether you type directly onto a computer or write by hand. You are asked whether you revise. You are asked how you know when you are finished with your revisions. What advice do you have for beginning writers? What advice do you have about getting an agent? What was the best advice anyone ever gave you? What is your morning schedule? Do you ever suffer from writer’s block? What is your remedy for writer’s block? Do you have children? A heavyset woman in a sleeveless, tentlike dress who has come late sits in a chair by the door, panting. She lifts an arm from which slack flesh hangs in a tremulous web to inquire what tips you have for poets “just starting out”—and “do you have children?” When you tell her that you don’t have children she smiles pityingly at you, as the others have done. “Ohhh! That’s too bad. Are you sorry?” Politely, you explain that it would depend upon the children you might have had, whether you are sorry never to have had them; but since you don’t know who they might have been, it is impossible to answer the question. A shrewd reply, you think. Yet your little audience looks baffled, dissatisfied. “None of us knew what our children would be like, before we had them,” the heavyset woman points out sensibly. “But we had them anyway. And now we have grandchildren.” This meets with murmured approval. A bushy-bearded man who has been smiling at you declares that he has a bag of books for you to sign—“for next Christmas.” The bag is made of burlap, oil-stained. Covers on the books don’t look familiar. Several books are very old, smelling of mold. A person with a wizened face asks brightly: “Do you think your life was worth it? All those books!” Now you realize that everyone in the room is older—old. Most—all?—are former classmates of yours whose names you should know but have forgotten. Not high school but earlier—middle school, grade school. Their faces are blurred with time. Several faces look as if they have begun to melt, decompose. The very air in the small space is sepia-toned, gluey. Yet eyes are alight, alert. “Are you proud of yourself, exploiting your past here in Yewville?” “Are you ashamed of yourself, exploiting your past here in Yewville?” “Do you consider yourself underrated?” “Do you consider yourself overrated?” “You would not do it again, would you?” “You could not do it again, could you?” These bold remarks meet with muffled laughter, titters. Marian Beattie laughs heartily. A woman with a smooth bald face, paisley kerchief tied about her hairless head, belligerently introduces herself as Lizzie Heardon—once a friend of yours? seventh grade? you are remembering, vaguely—proud to have been a kindergarten teacher for her entire life. Never wrote a word—never published a book, but took great joy in her career, and never regretted a moment. Another woman—is this Abigail? so changed, you don’t want to acknowledge her—speaks of being married, having children, working hard as wife, mother, homemaker, caretaker for the elderly and the infirm in her family and in her husband’s family, working very hard, working damned hard, never wrote a word, never published a book, never had time to read a damned book, worked harder, grew older, grew old, died (in 1999). She has grandchildren, however. She is not (yet) forgotten. And there is Olive. . . Olivia? One of the shrunken females, hardly more than child-size. She too is hairless, but wears a perky knitted cap. Hesitantly you smile at her. Hesitantly, you ask, “Did you ever forgive me?” You’d run away and abandoned her by the river. Of course—she was the girl. The howling boys, peals of jeering laughter. Someone had been throwing chunks of concrete. A rusted rod. You did run—panicked, in terror. But Olive, or Olivia, is saying now, laughing, “Ohhh no, that wasn’t me. You’re remembering wrong. In everything you write, you remember wrong. You were the one the boys chased, and caught—you were the one who cried, and tried to crawl away, and they laughed at you.” “I—I was not. . . ” “Of course you were. You were. That’s why you write such lies—to change the way things were, when you couldn’t change them any other way.” “That is—not true. It is—just—certainly—not true. . . ” You are speechless, indignant. Your eyes fill with tears. Olive, or Olivia, is rocking in her chair, laughing. She is maddeningly complacent, smug. You. You. You. You. Fortunately the others are distracted by photographs of grandchildren being passed around. Exclamations of delight, pride. No one thinks to include you. Vastly amused, Miss Beattie wipes her eyes. Tears of laughter have gathered in the fatty creases of her face. She asks a “favor” of you—to inscribe books for the library “for our special collection.” But she has only five of your numerous books, published long ago in the previous century. “Is this all you have?” you ask, surprised. “All? How many novels did Jane Austen write? Only five or six, yes? And she is immortal.” Miss Beattie speaks snidely to you. To prove her point she brings a card catalogue drawer to show you. “You see? There are only five books under your name. Here are the cards.” You examine the dog-eared cards, which give the correct birthdate for you but also a death date—1979. You protest—this is a mistake. You are not dead. Miss Beattie laughs. A clerical error, obviously! You are hurt. You are incensed. You would wrest the drawer from Miss Beattie and cross out the ridiculous death date, but Miss Beattie returns the drawer to the card catalogue. (This antique feature of the old library, long superannuated by the online catalogue, has been moved to the rear of the library.) With an impish expression Miss Beattie says, “By now you should have begun to recognize me. Are you really pretending you don’t know who I am?” “Who you—are?” “Yes! Indeed.” “I—I do not. . . ” Miss Beattie regards you at close range with a skeptical smirk. It is plain that this annoying woman does not respect you—considers you deceptive, dishonest. You have no idea why. Your nostrils pinch with her distinctive scent, the intimate smell of her fleshy body, soiled clothing, oily hair. Not an altogether disagreeable scent, and somewhat familiar, like the interior of your laundry hamper. “Look! Look closely.” Miss Beattie thrusts her face toward yours. Badly you want to push away from the strong-willed woman, who treats you with such familiarity. She is just slightly shorter than you, at about five feet six inches, but heavier by as many as seventy pounds. She holds you in a kind of hypnosis, gazing ironically into your eyes. The person you were meant to be, who’d never left Yewville. The woman is saying, still with an attempt at lightness, levity, though now you sense the bitterness beneath, how she had not left Yewville on a fancy scholarship, as you did: “I didn’t abandon my family who needed me. I got a degree in library science at the state university at Elmira and came right back. That was good enough for me!” How to respond to this accusation buried inside a boast. It is true, you’d once thought you might be a librarian and remain in Yewville. Or a teacher. And it is true that you were the recipient of a fancy scholarship that bore you away as if on wide, extended wings—the leathery wings of Milton’s Lucifer, you’ve thought. “But—I am not you. You are not—you are not me.” Your rejoinder to Miss Beattie is feeble, nearly inaudible. For you have no idea how to respond to her. You are happy for Miss Beattie that she is, or seems to be, so satisfied with her life in Yewville, yet you understand that you are being blamed, somehow, for not having stayed. Bitterly she tells you of those many classmates of yours who have passed away prematurely: individuals who died in car crashes and other accidents, of cirrhosis of the liver, of opioid overdoses, emphysema, strokes, heart attacks, cancer—“every kind of cancer”—as well as suicide—“every kind of suicide.” You are overcome with remorse. Sympathy. Yes, and guilt. But you have no idea what to say. If you’d failed to leave Yewville, if you’d failed utterly as a writer, and if you were living now in Yewville, how would that have altered the lives of Marian Beattie and the others? You would like to explain this, but Marian Beattie isn’t in a mood to listen to you. Now she is indignant: “But we don’t complain. Not hardly. We are patriotic. We are not treasonous, we don’t question our government. We don’t write fancy books that no one reads. We don’t look down our noses at the ‘common folk.’ ” You would apologize, but Marian Beattie isn’t interested in an apology from you. Huffily she leads you to a “reception” in your honor: on a card table, a punch bowl filled with gasoline-colored liquid, paper cups, platters of orange cheese and Ritz crackers, scattered bowls of peanuts. “Mingle with your fans, please. Some of them have journeyed a long way.” Grateful for something useful to do, you occupy yourself with signing books. Most of your audience has departed, but a few diehards remain, grinning at you. Pictures are taken with iPhones. You note that most of these books are years old, paperbacks with torn covers. No one seems to have purchased a hardcover copy of your most recent novel, and so you come to wonder if indeed it has been published yet or even written. Signing books on the title page with a flourish, even your signature begins to be unrecognizable. Still you are being plied with a few final questions that buzz about your head like gnats. When did you know you wanted to be a writer? What do you regret most about your life? Which is your favorite book of your own? Which is your least favorite? Would you do it all over again, if you had the choice, or would you choose another life? Would you remain in Yewville instead of leaving as you did at the age of eighteen? In which case, where would you be at this very moment? “Excuse me, please. . . ” Edging out the others, the gentleman in the wheelchair rolls himself forward to meet you. It appears that he is misshapen, or disfigured: his spine is twisted, one shoulder higher than the other, neck and head forced forward at an angle. In his lap, on his wasted thighs, is a large duffel bag filled with books as heavy and bulky as rocks. You see with relief that this man, though severely handicapped, is relatively youthful-looking, with a head of thick gray-white hair, a ruddy complexion, earnest pale eyes. He is clean-shaven, well groomed. His clothes are of high quality, if somewhat worn. Tenderly he confronts you: “Do you remember me? Rollo.” Rollo? Roland? Of course you remember: Roland Kidd. Your friend from math class. Eighth, ninth grades. A tall soft-bodied boy with an unexpectedly sweet smile, a left eye with a slight cast. Roland, or Rollo, is telling you how he has read virtually everything you’ve written; he has followed your career for decades. In the duffel bag are the small fraction of your books he has brought from his library. “You know, I never married. I almost did—I was engaged more than once—but truth is, I never felt for any girl or woman the way I’ve felt for you. Many times over the years I wanted to write to you, to explain how important you are to me, how avidly I read everything you write. . . . I admit, I am searching for myself in your fiction, and a few times I think I’ve found portraits of myself, not altogether flattering, but—well, it is flattering to be made ‘immortal’ in prose. At least, I’ve discovered enough of myself in your fiction to keep reading, and to keep hoping.” You are astonished to hear these extravagant words. You would recoil in disbelief except that Rollo Kidd speaks with enormous sincerity in the deep baritone voice of a radio broadcaster. So charismatic is he, the bullying Marian Beattie shrinks away abashed, the smirk fading from her face. You want to ask Rollo Kidd what he can possibly mean—“searching for myself” in your fiction. You dare not ask Rollo Kidd what he can possibly mean—“never felt for any girl or woman the way I felt for you.” Rollo is intent upon telling you about his house on Ridgemont Avenue with its walls of books in nearly every room, to the ceiling—“Many of them your books, dear. Both hardcover and paperback. I collect other contemporary American writers as well, but you are the center of my collection. Will you do me the honor of signing just a few books, inscribed to me? And dated? Thank you!” Remarkably, Rollo has brought seventeen of your books to be signed—all hardcover. You are thrilled, a bit dazzled, as if a blinding light were shining in your face, out of a pit of darkness. Signing books in the midst of chaos has been a kind of solace for you, like scrubbing a floor on your knees—in a way a pointless activity, except that the activity is the point. And now, signing Rollo Kidd’s books, so meticulously encased in plastic covers, you feel relief mounting to actual pleasure. As you sign his books Rollo waits close by in his wheelchair. He speaks of his “fidelity”—his “longtime commitment”—to you; the only one of his classmates whom he’d respected, and one of the very few to leave Yewville. He confesses that, several times he did write to you in care of your publisher, but he never had a reply, which he attributed to your publisher not forwarding his letters. Can this be true? You receive very few letters from readers, fewer in recent years than in the past, but had never given them much thought. From time to time people have complained to you that their letters to you hadn’t been forwarded. Possibly, Rollo Kidd’s letters had disappeared into that abyss. You feel a pang of regret, for (possibly) you would have answered Rollo’s letters. Even before the days of email, you sometimes replied to letters from strangers, in handwritten outbursts of sincerity. Rollo thanks you profusely for signing his books. His eyes brim with tears; he is deeply moved. (Yes, Rollo’s left eye is indeed slightly out of focus. But both Rollo’s eyes are thick-lashed, rather beautiful. You have to wonder if you’d dared to notice years ago, when you were a girl.) “Now I am hoping, my dear, that you might visit my house? Where I have a complete collection of your work? Not just hardcover books but paperbacks and other reprints, and many—many hundreds—of magazines and literary journals and anthologies in which your fiction has appeared. I would doubt that you own a complete set yourself. I think, my dear, you might see yourself in my collection, in my house, as you’ve never quite seen yourself.” My dear. These words, too, are caressing, hypnotic. No one has called you “my dear” in a very long time. “It’s only a short walk back to my house. Ten, fifteen minutes. I would be so honored! The culmination of my life, actually—to see you standing before shelves of your books—in my house. . . . Of course, you are welcome to spend the night here, instead of in the fancy hotel your hosts at the college have surely arranged. My house is at the farthest end of Ridgemont, overlooking the ravine and the river. Do you remember those old cobblestone houses we all admired when we were children? Like fairy-tale houses, with turrets, towers, slate roofs, wrought-iron fences? Built in the early years of the twentieth century? You remember.” You do remember. Vaguely at first, then more vividly. Ridgemont was one of the few prestigious streets in Yewville, adjacent to Ridgemont Park. In the loneliness of your life in exile from Yewville you have often performed an eidetic exercise: making your way, on foot, along Ridgemont, seeing in your mind’s eye each of the distinctive old houses. Now you realize that the houses were small mansions built in imitation of English architectural styles—predominantly English Tudor. But there were other styles as well, one of them the large foursquare cobblestone house set back amid a lawn of tall elms—probably this is the house Rollo Kidd lives in. You wonder how on earth he came to acquire it. For, if you recall correctly, the Kidd family was no more affluent than your family. “I have to admit, I purchased the house because of its numerous bookshelves—because I hoped to accommodate you. I became a local businessman—dabbled in real estate—expressly to make a little money and buy a house on Ridgemont Avenue. For I hoped, one day, if you ever returned to Yewville, you would come to visit me in that house. You would see what a shrine I have made for you, utterly without any expectation that you would ever come to me in this lifetime.” In this lifetime. Rollo speaks with such extravagance, you can’t possibly believe him. Yet there is such genuine feeling in the man, such youthful energy, in contrast to his physical condition. . . . (Does Rollo have Parkinson’s disease? He makes no effort to hide the tremor in his left hand.) You thank Rollo for his invitation but explain that you must return to your car, which has been hired to take you to the Buffalo airport. Yes, you did stay in a hotel the previous night, but you are leaving now, for your home in another state. “You have a ‘home’ elsewhere, to which you intend to return? Really?” Rollo laughs, baring glistening teeth. You find yourself laughing with him. It does seem absurd that you have a home not here in Yewville. Uncanny, how familiar this dignified older man seems to you. The more you stare at him from this close perspective, the more he resembles the boy you’d known when you and he were twelve, thirteen years old. As if you’d grown older together, not hundreds—or is it thousands?—of miles apart. Indeed, Rollo is more attractive now, in some respects, than he’d been as a pudgy adolescent. He has dressed himself in a dapper tweed sport coat and a cream-colored shirt, open at the throat. On his thin legs, trousers with a sharp crease. And on his feet limp as wooden blocks, black silk socks and polished black leather shoes. So sorry. You explain to Rollo Kidd that you can’t visit his house. With genuine regret, you just can’t. Maybe another time. . . Graciously you say farewell to the several admirers who remain at the card table sipping punch from paper cups. One of them, who’d claimed to be your old friend Lizzie Heardon, glares at you with an expression of intense dislike. You are feeling magnanimous, however. Rollo Kidd’s presence has suffused you with strength, even a sort of childish pride, and so you don’t turn away from Marian Beattie as you would like to do; instead, you grit your teeth and thank the spiteful woman, the woman you’d been meant to be, for her hospitality in welcoming you to the library. “In another thirty-six years I hope that I will be invited back again,” you tell Miss Beattie, gaily. You are leaving the library without a backward glance but—there comes Rollo Kidd wheeling himself after you. The man is not shy in pursuit but rather exhilarated, determined. As you descend the front steps he rolls himself down a parallel ramp, so swiftly that his thick, graying white hair, a silky sort of hair, is blown in the wind. “Please accept my invitation, my dear. You will be astonished to see my house—a shrine to you. I wasn’t exaggerating! I promise I won’t expect you to sign more than a few of your limited-edition publications. These are kept under lock and key in a specially designed bookcase with glass doors that lock. . . ” You see, at the curb, the stately black hired car awaiting you. Yet you linger, reluctant to be rude to Rollo Kidd. Your heart swells with the melancholy certainty that Rollo Kidd was meant to be your soul mate; yet, something went wrong in your early life, you’d missed each other. Even now you are thinking—You can return. You can begin again. Here is the one person in the world who cherishes you. You are walking beside Rollo, who rolls himself at your side. Astonishing how companionable the two of you are, how familiar with each other; that you loom above Rollo in his wheelchair feels familiar to you as well. You note with approval how Rollo is determined to ignore his infirmity. Indeed, his upper arms and shoulders, his back, have thickened with muscle, in the effort of rolling his nonmotorized chair; the very slant of his head has been reimagined by the man as not a disability brought on by Parkinson’s disease but a sort of macho hypervigilance. This man is not meek, shy, invalided; he is aggressive, even belligerent. Here is a man not easily dissuaded. Here is a man who knows his own mind. He dares to take your hand that has drifted close to his, and will not readily surrender it. You recall how as a boy, Rollo Kidd was admired by his teachers. He was invariably a class officer—eighth grade vice president, ninth grade president. Rollo was your (friendly) rival in English, science, math; Rollo received higher grades in math and science, but you excelled (usually) in English. “At least stroll with me, my dear. Ridgewood Park is just a block away. And from the edge of the park, another five minutes to my house. From the front walk, I swear you can see bookshelves through the windows—you will see the spines of your own books, waiting for you. At all the windows! As if peering out at you. Wait and see—I’ve arranged it very cleverly—it will be quite a sight. . . ” Gently you tug at your hand, to be freed of Rollo’s hand, but not assertively enough to induce Rollo to release it. And of course you would not jerk your hand away, that would be rude. You will walk with Rollo for a few minutes, into the park perhaps, but no farther; certainly not to Ridgemont Avenue. Your car is awaiting you at the curb in front of the library, and you have every intention of returning to it. “Only a little farther, my dear! You will not be disappointed, I promise.” Just the two of you. Rollo Kidd in his wheelchair, propelling himself along. You, on foot. Your (cool, slender) hand in Rollo’s (hot, fleshy) hand. It is a chill bright day. The sky overhead appears to be impacted with clouds, light comes from all sides, there are no shadows. In the distance, nearly inaudible, a sound of thunder, or jet planes. Behind you and Rollo Kidd in his wheelchair, unobtrusively, out of the range of your vision, the shiny black limousine follows slowly, keeping pace.

        "story": "All his life he lived on hatred. He was a solitary man who hoarded gloom. At night a thick smell filled his bachelor’s room on the edge of the kibbutz. His sunken, severe eyes saw shapes in the dark. The hater and his hatred fed on each other. So it has ever been. A solitary, huddled man, if he does not shed tears or play the violin, if he does not fasten his claws in other people, experiences over the years a constantly mounting pressure, until he faces a choice between lunacy and suicide. And those who live around him breathe a sigh of relief. Good people are afraid of hatred, and even tend not to believe in it. If it appears before their eyes, they generally call it dedication or some such name. And so we of the kibbutz thought of him as a man who lived by his faith, and who because of his faith dealt severely with the world and with all of us. He was not considered one of the leaders of the kibbutz. His dedication never earned him a position of authority or respect, in a committee or a council, for example. And so it came about that in the course of time we invested him with a halo of self-sufficient reticence. This halo preserved him from gossip. What can one say, he is not like everyone else, he says little and does much. Admittedly, a solitary man. It can’t be helped. But the kibbutz depends for its existence on men like him. And if he sometimes says harsh things about us, we are forced to admit to ourselves that our everyday lives do not always conform to the ideals that we profess, and consequently we deserve his rebukes. He works with machines. Photograph by Gerald Slota At six o’clock every morning he is awakened by his alarm clock. He struggles into his greasy overalls and goes down to the dining hall. Here he munches a thick slice of brown bread smothered in jam and washes it down with coffee. Then, from quarter past six to nine o’clock, he dirties himself with grease in a tin shed, which roasts like an oven in the summer heat, while in winter the rain beats upon it a dull, monotonous tattoo. At nine he returns to the hall and washes his rough hands with paraffin, with coarse soap and with ordinary soap, to get rid of the black grease. But the black never goes away, it merely turns gray. Over breakfast he casts his eye over the outer edges of the morning paper, looking for news on which hatred can flourish: crime, corruption, degeneracy, betrayal of the ideals for which the State was founded. After breakfast he returns to his shed. This is his battlefield against cogwheels, fan belts, carburetors and radiators, spark plugs, and batteries. We see in him a skilled craftsman and, in our usual undemonstrative way, we admire his workmanship. He wrestles with implements and components as if they had a will of their own—a treacherous, rebellious will that it is his task to subjugate and set on the right path. Only on rare occasions does he hurl some part away and hiss: “It’s no good. Dead. We’ll have to get a new one.” On such rare occasions he resembles a military commander who has suffered a setback that he resolves to bear with dignity but with clenched teeth. In most cases, however, he manages to mend, to repair, to set to rights. His sunken eyes fasten on a rebellious oil pump, and there is suppressed rage coupled with infinite patience in his look. A schoolmasterly patience, we once remarked to ourselves. The two phrases most commonly heard on his lips are “we’ll see” and “so that’s it.” At times he grinds between his teeth the word “really.” He is a heavily built man. So heavily that it sometimes seems as if the lines of his face and body are sagging gradually downward, as though he suffers more than most men from the law of gravity. The furrows in his face are vertical, so are the hopeless wrinkles round his mouth, his broad shoulders are hunched, his hands dangle when he walks, even his gray hair always falls down over his forehead. At half past twelve he leaves the shed and walks up to the dining hall. He always piles his plate high with meat, potatoes, and an indiscriminate assortment of vegetables. While he vigorously masticates this meal his eyes once more run over the newspaper, finding change and decay in all around. At quarter past one he returns to the shed and works until close on four o’clock. These are the hardest hours. In summer the shed roasts, and in winter the wind’s icy claws penetrate through the broken windows. He sighs deeply, almost aloud, but staunchly carries on with his work. He spreads a black piece of sacking on the concrete floor under the machine and prostrates himself on it so to peer into the motor from beneath. In twenty-seven years he has never entered a single day’s illness in the kibbutz work register. When his working day is over, he returns once more to the hall. He gorges himself again, as he did first thing in the morning, on brown bread and jam. He washes it down with warm milk. Then he goes to his room. Here he showers, shaves, lies down on his bachelor’s bed, and leafs through the newspaper until he dozes off. He has still not reached the middle pages. The evening twilight wakes him from his nap as if it had bitten him. At this time he is always seized by a great dread, despair, a premonition. As if this twilight were final. Once and for all. He hurriedly puts on his trousers, makes himself a cup of coffee, and settles himself in the armchair to tackle the middle pages of the paper. As he reads the leading article, the commentary and analysis columns, the personal opinions, summaries of the speeches by the leaders of the Movement and the Party, he experiences a pain that is almost physical. His face wears an expression of ascetic, mortified severity, far from all charity or compassion. Damn them. What are they doing to us. Why do they ruin everything worthwhile. There is a grim judicial look in his eye. His lips tremble. Occasionally there flashes in his eyes a momentary sparkle of hatred, the hatred that others interpret as dedication. He follows the articles with his pencil. Makes notes. Not in words but with signs alone. Question mark. Question mark, exclamation mark. Vertical stroke. Double exclamation marks. And sometimes even a furious crossing out in the body of the article. The twilight fades and darkness comes on. He must turn on the light. The electric light tires his eyes and dulls his alertness without which lucid thought is impossible. He is terrified of this yellow light, as if it were trying to bribe him, to subvert his judgment. Clear reasoning becomes cloudy, and after half an hour or an hour apparitions begin to arrive. He can no longer pursue the claim of sharp, analytical argument. He no longer has the power to bring the current events of which the paper speaks before the high tribunal of the teaching of the great visionaries, the fathers of the Movement. And he is tired of judging. The electric light hurts his eyes. He stares vacantly. Apparitions come to him. And with them comes pain. His face loses its grim, judicial expression, which can, albeit with great difficulty, be described as attractive or even spiritual, and without it he is suddenly an ugly, an almost unbearably ugly man. The kibbutz children call him “wicked Haman” behind his back, and point their fingers at him. But the time between the onset of twilight and the arrival of the darkness is the best time of all. He has this time, before he must turn the electric light on and submit to tiredness and haziness, to put things in their proper order. He studies the newspaper with pure, ice-cold hatred. He drafts the charge sheet with penetrating acuteness, section after section. How the State has betrayed her visionaries’ vision, how she played the whore and defiled herself. A whole nation is giving itself up to debauchery and abandoning every vision. The Jewish State was meant to begin a new chapter in the history of the Jews, and instead it is coming to look like a kind of farewell party, an orgy to celebrate the happy ending of the terrible history of the Jews. But the terrible history is still at its height. The knives are even now being sharpened. For generations upon generations the Jews were a deep and serious people. Now they have become a degenerate Levantine rabble, rushing to gratify themselves and satisfy their lusts with every kind of novel excitement. Until one day the enemy will come and gather in his spoil like driftwood, and we shall wake up to find that all our hopes have turned to dust. People do not perish through military defeat or economic collapse. They do not understand this. Even those who call themselves the leaders, the heirs of the fathers of the Movement, do not understand it. No, peoples fall into decay, and only then does the enemy come and enter the gate; he conquers everything at the height of the feast, when the defenders are besotted and enfeebled. Disaster will strike like lightning out of a clear sky. At the height of the great banquet. It is not war that will destroy the land, but corruption. Already the stench lies heavy on the air, night is falling, everything is becoming hazy in this yellow electric light. Perhaps I ought to write a letter to the editor. But who am I. A good pair of spectacles might perhaps have relieved this suffering. But this simple solution does not occur to him. Wearily and painfully he squints at the yellow light bulb and sees apparitions. He sees the crowds of voluptuous painted women thronging the city streets as though they were born only to give and receive pleasure. He sees the young men, dressed like Americans in the pictures, wearing elegant ties fastened with silver clips. They wear dark glasses and a purposeful air. He sees the boys and girls, grandchildren of the Maccabees, heirs of the guardians and defenders and dreamers, and here they are wrecking the public telephones or singing dirty songs in the streets at night. He sees the outrageously low-cut dress of his younger sister, Esther. He sees her shapely form boarding the Italian airplane: parting at the airport. They are only going away for a few years, she and her husband, Gideon, until he is promoted to a respectable office job that will allow him to live permanently in his own town instead of roaming around foreign capitals like an errand boy. Then the feel of his sister’s body in their parting embrace. He sees the plane: the hubbub of people arriving, leaving, seeing off, meeting, the stewards loving everyone indiscriminately, and me in the middle of this airport carnival like an evil spirit: why are they all leaving, why all this commotion, what’s the matter, surely at times like this we should all be overcome with wonderment. Then the sound of the tires on the gray asphalt, like lecherous whispers in the middle of the night: two o’clock in the morning, in a stream of quiet, powerful, brightly colored cars in which new, free Jews sit two by two, male and female. Where are they going, all these crowds of people, at two o’clock in the morning. Who will get up for work tomorrow. And who needs these new buildings, concrete and glass, curved shapes like a woman’s hips. All the contagious effluvia of America in this land of dreams. Even the Hebrew policeman in the night smiles a kind of stylized, courteous smile at me as if he too shares in the universal friendliness. And the universal sobriety. The whispering seduction. The cold humor, which is lechery, which is seething debauchery, which is abomination itself. We tried to realize a dream, and it has all turned into Hollywood. The Land of Israel is a whore. The man who hates his country is called a traitor, but the man who hates the treacherous whore is truly loyal to the dream that has been betrayed. If the pain in your eyes is driving you to distraction, you can always go out into the darkness and take a little walk outside the kibbutz, then make a good supper of a huge salad with cream and salt fish, three slices of bread and cream cheese, and two glasses of tea. Should you find yourself next to someone suitable, you can sit and chat. Not about party strategy, calculations of political profit and loss, but about setting the world to rights. After supper he does not leave the hall, but takes a seat at the table where the evening newspaper is being read. This is the copy that the treasurer has brought back with him from town. It is surrounded by a ring of veteran comrades. Those who are standing read standing, over the heads of those who are seated. And some of those who are seated read upside down. Gradually a discussion begins, an argument develops. It begins with explanations, interpretations, comparisons between what is happening now and what happened in the old days. Then the heat rises, because the discussion turns to what ought to happen, and what we should be doing. There are moderates and there are extremists, and there are those who always seek the golden mean between the two. Most of them are unable to see where things are leading. Or perhaps they consciously deceive themselves. He is obliged to open their eyes, because these are the last of the faithful. He sets to work explaining to them how the rot has attacked the roots. How this crazy country is gorging itself on its own flesh unawares. Admittedly, the structure is still growing and spreading. Apparently, settlements are being added, new roads are being built. But any biologist will testify that even a corpse will go on growing hair and nails until it is decomposed. The whole structure is already doomed to destruction, from corruption and into corruption. The cancer will feed on the whore until she dies. Drunken shouts, parochial boasts, empty words cannot conceal the treachery. The people have betrayed their leaders, the leaders have betrayed the people, and both alike have betrayed the vision. The kibbutz might have been the last bastion of the Third Commonwealth, but even it has been betrayed, its leaders and people have gone together to the whore. All his listeners discern a great deal of exaggeration in this, but the older veterans know that it contains an element of holy anger, and perhaps even truth, and it is as well for some of the younger men to take these words at their face value and perhaps receive a jolt. But the younger men, three or four in number, merely grin. They find it strange that a man can be a brilliant mechanic and at the same time such an utter fool. Since the disputants are workingmen, not layabouts, they generally stop toward ten o’clock and say: “We’ll talk about this some other time. We’ll argue it all out then.” Then they all go to their rooms, and only the night watchmen are left awake, and even they do not go out and lurk in the dark along the perimeter fence but linger in the dining hall, taking tiny sips of their tea to kill time and flirting with the night nurses, who ought to be at the nursery, not here. Nothing is as it should be. He goes back to his room. He crosses the lawn and finds a sprinkler left on and a leaking hose. He must conquer his hatred. Reaching his room, he turns on the light. Again it hurts his eyes. Despite the tiredness he takes an old tome down from the rough wooden bookcase and settles himself to read the words of the founders. Others still sustain themselves on what they have read in their youth and do not realize that forgetfulness is gradually eating away at their faith. Whereas he persistently returns every evening to what he was taught many years ago in the Zionist Youth Movement in Lithuania. He devotes himself, heart and soul, to the cruel beauty of the words of the vision. True, most of the fathers of the Movement did not write in polished Hebrew, but their thinking was polished, and nothing of their analytical vigor has been lost. And there are some pages that only now, in these unsavory times, suddenly take on the full depth of their meaning. After a few pages, tiredness gets the better of him: he is no longer young, he spends long hours each day in arduous physical work, and every evening he wrestles with all his might with theories and ideas. Obviously he would have liked to go on reading with all his might and main, only his body is tired. During the night the thick smell always begins to fill the room. Even in summer, when all the windows are wide open, there is no refuge from it. The sounds of the night come in and swoop at him as soon as he turns out the light and tries to go to sleep. Even a man with a clear view of the word is helpless in the face of these wild sounds. He tries to hear in the sounds an echo of his thoughts, either by a play on the words “wind” and “spirit” or by translating the howling of the jackals into the wailing of foxes, which is a common image for national calamity, and also for lunacy and death. But the night sounds here in our kibbutz between the mountains and the winding valleys are stronger than any image; they sweep everything away, they swoop down on you in the night, and words are lost. He was a solitary man who hoarded gloom. The hater and his hatred fed on each other. So it has ever been. Many years ago he had a wife: a refugee, odd, very thin, acid, a survivor of one of the ghetto risings. She had come here to tell him how both his brothers had died heroically, firing at the Germans until their ammunition ran out. She went on talking. When she stopped, night had fallen. So she stayed the night. And the next night. She was several years older than he. After their marriage, she tried to make him leave the kibbutz. Her plan was to live on help from her relations, on German reparation money, to set herself up properly and live well. The kibbutz was a good enough place, but not for her. She had suffered enough for the Jewish people: let others suffer now for a change; she wanted to live a little, at long last. She was thin and acid. Her body satisfied and yet did not satisfy his hunger. After a few months they parted. She went her way, he remained. Her relations gave her a little, the reparation money made up the rest, and she opened a fashion salon that was every bit as good as the salon she had had in Warsaw before. Since she had not remarried, he continued to visit her on his rare trips to town. He went to beg for her body. Sometimes she granted it, with a sigh, telling him to be quick and not mess about, chiding herself for her good nature, which was always landing her in trouble. He would start arguing with her about the point of it all. He hated her, of course, with all his heart. But this was a daytime hatred, which was entirely different from the nocturnal hatred to which the night sounds outside responded. The night is alive. His sunken, severe eyes see shapes in the dark. The room is not clean. Dust here and there. Under the bed a forgotten pair of socks. The sound of the crickets comes in waves. Distant lowing of cattle. A shriek. A tractor growling in a far-off field. Dogs barking as though demented. Laughter of couples crossing the lawn, sinking into the darkness of the wadi. Damn them. And jackals in the vineyard. A hot wind blows from the desert and ruffles the trees, warning them of the fire and the axe for which they are growing: there is nothing new in the world. He tries turning on the radio to silence these tormenting sounds. What is there on the radio? A sensual tune, a lascivious song, a sickeningly warm, moist voice. He switches it off and curses the singer, and meanwhile all the night sounds return. Sleep hits him suddenly, like a coup de grâce. In his sleep, voluptuous women, with hips and laughter and hair. Then a scream may sound in the night. The watchmen say: “Poor devil. What can be done.” A few days before New Year, he went to Tel Aviv in connection with his work, to inspect and possibly order a new kind of American piston. As usual, he went to see his ex-wife. She made him coffee. They argued a little about the news and the point of it all. He asked for her body. She refused, and he begged a little. In vain: it transpired that she was about to remarry. No, not for love. What a crazy idea: Who would marry for love, at her age and with her experience? No. Her man was also from Warsaw, he had also lost his former family, he too had been miraculously saved, and he too dealt in ladies’ clothes. Together they could go far. He left his ex-wife without saying goodbye. He stepped hesitantly out into the city. Gradually his stride became more confident and even furious. He went to his sister’s flat, forgetting that she and her husband were in Europe, and would remain there for another year or two at least, until Gideon got his promotion. The tenants received him politely. They thought he had come to check up on the state of the furniture. They promised they were taking good care of the flat. They invited him in, to have a drink and to ascertain with his own eyes that everything was in good order. But he stood in the doorway, cursed them, and left. He walked the streets of Tel Aviv until nightfall, and saw that everything was lost. At dusk the fluorescent streetlights came on and hurt his eyes. He turned onto the dark side streets. Toward midnight he came on the agricultural machinery showrooms where he had intended to inspect and possibly order the new piston he had read about in the prospectus. The street was in darkness, and the showroom was closed and deserted. A wave of hatred rose in his chest until he could hear his own breathing. The bastards had shut up shop and gone off to chase women. How wonderful were the early fathers of the Labor Movement, who foresaw it all and even warned us in advance. We made light of their writings. Even a corpse goes on growing hair and nails until it finally rots. At the end of the same street he picked up a whore, followed her to a cheap hotel, and gave her the money he had intended to spend in the showroom. He stayed with her till morning and hated her and himself profoundly. Next day he returned to the kibbutz and worked on his machines; he read the special New Year number of the newspaper from cover to cover and waited for darkness to fall. When it was dark he went out to the orchard and hanged himself from a tree. We found him after the festival, and praised his devotion to his work, and his dedication to the ideals to which we hold fast. The burial of a man who has devoted himself to setting the world to rights is no different from that of any other man, and we have nothing more to add. He was a solitary man. May he rest in peace.

        "story": "They were released. For the first time in seven years, they stood outside in the courtyard of the reeducation center. They looked across at the gate. They remembered none of this. The flagpole and the towers. The cameras. Prany counted the sentries in the towers. He heard the rattle of keys as the guard behind him, wearing a green uniform, undid his handcuffs. Then the guard undid Vang’s. They rubbed their free wrists. Vang made fists with his hands. Illustration by Simon Pemberton Prany dug the soles of his new shoes into the dirt. He watched Vang’s hands and then turned to see the building they had exited. It resembled a schoolhouse or a gymnasium. The flag flapped in the wind. The sun on him. The immense sky. His neck was stiff. He knew that if they were forced to run right now his legs might buckle. Not because he was weak, but because in this moment, in the new environment, out in the open, his entire body felt uncertain. It was early. A different guard wearing a short-brimmed hat stepped out from the balcony above them and lit a cigarette. A rifle was slung behind him. His figure tall against the blue sky. He tapped his cigarette and the ash fell. It was already cold by the time it hit Prany’s shoulders. The guard tried again, aiming at Prany’s face. Prany pretended not to notice. He couldn’t stop looking at the sky. From inside came the faint noise of an announcement on the loudspeakers. Then he caught the sounds that had kept them company through the years: the hum of the electrical wires outside the cells, the footsteps in the small rear yard where they were able to play a bit of soccer and during the monsoons feel the rain on them. The birds. He remembered the shock of hearing one, unable to recall the last time he had. It was almost enough to get him through the week. He had once stopped in the field where he had been forced to work, not caring that in ten seconds he would be punished for it. Then the desire to see the bird had driven him insane. Someone was playing soccer now. He caught the sound of a ball bouncing, waited for another. An hour ago, they had signed documents pledging loyalty to this country. They had been brought to a concrete room where there was a long, wooden desk and two chairs across from each other. A portrait of the prime minister was hanging on the wall. Then a man they had never seen before, wearing an ill-fitting suit, came in, sat on the chair below the portrait, and gestured for Prany to take the other. Prany was unused to the grip of a pen. He wrote slowly, watching the ink appear and bleed, forming his name. A part of him was stunned he still knew how to write it. He had never learned how to read or to write, had hardly ever considered language as something visible, but from Vang they had learned how to write their names one night at the farmhouse, all of them unable to sleep. Vang by a desk with three legs, the other built of books, and the three of them taking turns writing on a damp page in his notebook, in candlelight, the ink smearing as they ignored the sound of the distant bombers. Years after that night, in their cell one day, he wondered aloud where the notebook was, and Vang, pausing, replied, “I never had a notebook.” That was the first time Prany stopped being sure of his memories. In the room, Prany asked the official in the suit across from him what day it was. The official seemed surprised. They knew months and years. They didn’t trust days. The officer said, “Today is Wednesday, the second of February, 1977.” It occurred to Prany that he couldn’t recall how his sister wrote her name, would not have been able to identify her handwriting among a thousand others. “When did I come in?” Prany said. The guard behind him reached for Prany’s neck and slammed him down against the desk. Prany gripped the pen. Immediately his nose began to bleed. His nose often bled. He sniffed as hard as he could and swallowed his blood and wiped his lips with his tongue. The official was looking at him as though Prany had asked him whether he owned sheep. “You came in on the tenth of January, 1970. Both of you did. You were at one of those decrepit mountain camps. All of you, how many were there? One hundred? Hiding like mice in your huts with your ten bullets and rusty rainwater. You couldn’t even farm. So malnourished you were probably dying and didn’t know it. All that, because of what? You lost. We are not animals. We would have taken care of you. We did take care of you.” Behind him, Vang, silent, was leaning against the wall beside the guard. “We’re approaching the next decade,” Prany said. “Yes. Quite.” “How’s it going so far?” From behind, he heard the guard step toward him again, but the official waved him away. The man took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly, looking at Vang, whose own glasses were covered in scratches and almost unwearable. “A new decade for you, too,” the man said. “Your age.” “That’s right. A new decade for me.” “That’s wonderful,” the man said. “A fresh start.” “Yes,” Prany said. “A fresh start.” “How many men are given that in life? To start again. To have that chance. You are now a member of this society, men of this society, both of you, and you get to contribute to its success. What a gift.” Only then did the man reach across and take back the pen. It was as though he were waiting to see what Prany would do with it. Prany had done nothing. He watched the man tap it on the edge of the desk and consider Prany. There was a clock on the wall above his head. Behind Prany, a square of sky. The man took out a file and confirmed their relocation and new postings at a village in Luang Prabang. From a sheet he read to them that they would report to the administrative office tonight. There was a temporary room in a house that they could stay in for the week. It had all been arranged. This was also a great gift for them: to be together, given that they were not related. Others were not so lucky, he said. “As you have learned, our country is rich in natural resources, and we should develop them. Under the old regime we were not working hard enough, yes? How could we under such oppression? So dysfunctional were we, corrupted by the Japanese, the French, the Americans. We had to always ask people, and countries, for help. But now, here, all of us: look at us now. We broke that cycle. We freed you. We taught you how to be self-sufficient. We taught you how to grow food if you didn’t know how. We taught you how to build fishponds. To raise pigs and chickens. You worked this land. Every day, you worked this land. This center, as far back as it goes, was your land. You helped us, and you helped yourselves. It is all wonderful. Now you will be self-sufficient. You will use all this knowledge to help your village. And then your village will help others. You will, together, collectively, be hardworking and clean and pure. You will prosper from your education these past years, and you will think on this day as the first in your new life and be grateful to us.” “You’re very generous today,” Prany said, and this time the man leaned across and gripped Prany’s left hand, crushing the fingers, pulling him across the desk. Prany stifled a scream. “The Party and Government’s intelligence is clear and bright,” the official said. “All praise, all praise, all praise.” Vang quickly repeated the words and then, after a pause, Prany, breathing between his teeth, said them, too: “The Party and Government’s intelligence is clear and bright: all praise, all praise, all praise.” The official let go. For the first time, he addressed Vang: “I am actually feeling quite generous today. But you’ll have to keep an eye on this one. In fact, if he gets into any trouble, it’s you we’ll come for, yes? Do you understand? He’s your responsibility now.” The official looked down at the file. “Doctor,” he said. “Yes. Quite. Sorry, no doctor postings available.” He chuckled and gave them their new papers. He also slid over clothes for them that smelled harshly of chemicals. Then the official stood, congratulated them on their reeducation, and wished the two of them good health, good work, and long, peaceful lives. Now, in the courtyard, a van pulled up. The guard on the balcony went inside. Prany held on to a head cushion and climbed up after Vang did. The windows had been blacked out. The divide between their seats and the front had been walled up as well, so that they were blind as they drove across the courtyard, the van bouncing slightly as they left through the gate. Without turning, Vang spoke to Prany softly, the way they were used to doing. He was speaking in French. On the second day, using a hammer, they had broken the bones of the doctor’s fingers first, wanting names of CIA officers. Wanting the location of Hmong fighters. A woman they called “Auntie.” Then they broke Prany’s fingers. Vang’s recovered. Prany lost the use of his left hand. “The dates,” Vang said. “In that room. Why did you want to know the dates?” The van bounced again as they turned onto a smoother road. The driver sped. In the dark, Prany could hear only the air. He watched the quick shadows in the thin space along the bottom of the side door. He had forgotten about speed. The speed of a vehicle. He grew light-headed again. He fought it by breathing deeply. In the prison, in their later years, they had mostly left Prany alone, but they had kept returning to Vang. They called him the pretty doctor. The men would lift him by his arms and drag him down the hall, barefoot, to where the interrogator was waiting for him, and he would be gone for an hour. Prany couldn’t hear him. He couldn’t hear anything. He counted the seconds to distract himself and to time how long he was alone. In that hour, it was the complete silence that terrified them. Vang asked him again. “Why did you want to know the dates?” Prany said that he wanted to hear someone other than themselves say it aloud. The months, the years. He asked whether Vang understood. This doctor he had now known for a decade and who had kept practicing French with him in the cell as a thread of sanity. Vang, whom he would never see after today. “Stay focused,” Vang said. “We’re out.” Then the doctor mimed punching the ceiling a few times, his arms like pistons, restless as they sped across the smoothness of a paved highway. The wind grew louder. The engine. Seven years. Prany was twenty-five. Vang was almost forty. They had no idea where they were. They were dropped off at a bus station near Vang Vieng. It didn’t matter anymore, but Prany had timed how long they had been in the van and wondered if they had been kept somewhere in the north, near the Chinese border. There was a time when he used to spend all day attempting to orient himself by the shape of a far slope, the temperature during the colder months. The wind and the weather, or the flight path of a bird—a bird! This need for a compass. The delirium of it. He would have offered his other hand simply to know. When the van door opened, Prany was still unsure of where he was, whether he was in fact still in Laos. He almost wept. It wasn’t because he recognized the bus station. He had never seen it before. It was simply because they hadn’t been taken back, that the building looked different than the buildings of the prison. And because they were still in Laos. “Take the first bus,” the guard in the passenger seat said. “Wait at the bench. Good health.” And then the van drove away, leaving the two of them in front of the station, which appeared empty. Vang kneeled to retie his shoes. They had been given matching clothes—white shirts, gray trousers, and black shoes—and they were still getting used to them, the feel of them, that smell, the shapes. Whose clothes were they wearing? In first imagining and then planning this day, they had been uncertain about the clothes. To them it was a miracle that they had been given anything at all. They were about two hundred kilometers southwest of Phonsavan. Closer to Vientiane. They were not yet used to the brightness as they walked around to the back of the station, lifting their hands for shade as they found the shell of what had been a school bus, rusted, propped up on bricks. Behind it, two small billboards that had probably been intended for the roadside were stacked against the wall: in the first, there was an illustration of an elephant carrying felled logs through a forest; in the other, a woman repairing a chair. No one came. But Vang kept a lookout as Prany opened the lid of a trash container. He didn’t spot the box at first. He saw only the garbage and some rotten fruit and rice, and he held his breath, wondering whether something had gone wrong. But then it was there: the shoebox with an American brand on the lid, as they were promised. He flipped it open. Inside, there was a thick envelope of money and a small hunting knife, the blade folded into the metal handle. A stray dog appeared, sniffing their shoes, his nose following the scent of the garbage. Prany reached in to the garbage container again and tossed the dog a handful of the fruit and rice. Then he passed the money and the knife to Vang and left the shoebox there. They returned to the front of the station and waited. They stood in the quiet, with a mountain range in the east and a village to the north, a small collection of rooftops by the river. They were distracted by the vast emptiness. There were no buses, no one on the road. There was only the mountain. The distance. From the road, an old man appeared, crossing the lot and sitting on the bench near the front entrance to the station. He was wearing clothes similar to theirs, and they waited to see if he would try to speak to them, but he didn’t. He lifted up his sleeve as though he had a watch and scratched a knuckle in a way that made Prany suddenly remember a girl he had met in a southern town. He had convinced her to ride a rickshaw he had stolen for an hour to try to make some money. This was before the fighting intensified across the country. Her profile in the rearview and the scent of her in the back as she kept reaching over his shoulder, her money grazing his ear as she told him to keep going. Where did they go? He tried to remember. He and Vang hadn’t moved from the station entrance. He was tired. They were both so tired. Shy of the new landscape. This new world. Still afraid. The way the feeling was there like a contrail as they kept gazing out at the distance. How nothing came up from behind the ridgeline, how in five minutes nothing in the landscape had altered. How there was no sound other than the wind. The gait of the dog and the dust. “Shall we walk?” Prany said. They could. In their plan, they had talked about saving their energy, but it wasn’t far. Prany suddenly wanted to walk forever. He thought he could. He paced a little. He could feel his heart. Together, they tracked a bird in the air. How many birds did they end up watching? He had witnessed the doctor grow older. Gray was appearing in his hair. In his memory of the man, there was only this face now, not the one that would lean so close to the keyboard of the piano that they thought he was going to disappear into it. Prany remembered now. Eventually, he took the girl to a ceremony a relative of hers was hosting. She got out without looking at him and then, to his surprise, took his wrist and made him follow her up a hill. They entered a landscape he had never seen: a high field domed in suspended candlelit lanterns hanging from poles. It was as though he had stumbled upon that other world the shamans claimed they had access to. There was a small crowd and a shaman was standing at the center. The girl he had driven took the string the crowd gave her and bound her wrist and then bound the rest of the string to Prany’s. They were all bound, the entire crowd. And then they approached the shaman, who flung the smoke of the incense over them. He came back never knowing what they were celebrating, just that they had been bound, he with those strangers and the girl, and that they had been blessed. Still in the echo of it as Alisak and Noi slept by a river. He had stopped on the way and bought as many pears as he could carry, the fruit spilling from his arms. They never noticed he was gone. Only the new scent on him, the incense and the girl’s perfume of herbs and flowers. A car appeared, approaching the bus station. They tracked it like the bird as it approached, slowed, and turned in. The old man on the bench ignored it. Other than the van that had dropped them off, it was the first vehicle they had seen. They checked the road one last time for any sign of the bus they were supposed to take, but nothing else came over the ridge. The window rolled down. “Faster to ride with me,” the driver said. He nodded and gestured to them to come in. He was wearing sunglasses. They had slid down his nose, and he looked first at Vang and then at Prany, who brought his arms behind him. It was a taxi. Or some version of one; there were no signs. There were strips of duct tape across the passenger seat and a jug of water on the floor. They checked as quickly and discreetly as possible—what he was wearing, the dash, the backseat—for any clue that he might be an official or Pathet Lao, but couldn’t find any. So Prany named an inn on the western side of a reservoir. It wasn’t very far, perhaps five kilometers south. He asked the driver if he could take them there. “I know it,” the driver said, and named a price. They didn’t argue with him. They got in, and then they were heading south. They stayed silent, staring out the windows. Prany kept waiting to get used to the speed of a vehicle. The speed of the world passing. The undulating shapes of the hills. An abandoned farm and what looked like a new cement factory. There were still bomb craters in fields that hadn’t been filled and the remnants of a roadside restaurant, the windows and the door all gone. The driver was eyeing them through the rearview. “What time is it?” Vang said. “What?” “The time.” Vang lifted his wrist. “Noon,” the driver said. Vang grinned. It had been years since he had asked for the time and someone had answered him. He leaned forward and asked if they could hear music. The driver laughed, pressed a button on the radio. All they could hear was static. “You’re not from here,” he said. They approached the boundary of the massive reservoir that seemed to them an inland ocean. It was impossible to see the far bank. The taxi followed the road that ran along the reservoir’s western side, passing islands, some of them with old structures. A blue ferryboat with no passengers cut across the water. Then, just as quickly, they drove away from the reservoir and entered a forest. Soon, a sign for the inn appeared, and the driver turned onto an unpaved road that they followed for a kilometer until it opened out onto a round courtyard. The building was on the far end. It was a wide, two-story structure with fading red paint and dark shutters. There were some plants and a copper fish at the center of the courtyard, so oxidized they were unsure what it was at first, the fish in midair, as though caught and being reeled in. “So then, where are you from?” the driver said, pulling up to the front. They had practiced this. “Phonsavan,” Prany said. They had practiced every day for years, but in that moment he didn’t say what he was supposed to say. Suddenly, those years collapsed, and he felt as though he were falling. It was too late now. He knew Vang was avoiding looking at him. It would be the one mistake Prany would think of, not at this moment, but one day months from now, leaping out of a van and running. “I have a cousin in Phonsavan,” the driver said. “Good restaurant. You must know it, yes? Best food in the town.” He named the restaurant. He said, “Survived the war, the restaurant,” and Vang said, “Yes. Wonderful,” and took out double the amount the driver had asked for. The driver paused, trying to hide his surprise. Then he pushed up his sunglasses and slipped the money into his back pocket. “I can wait,” the driver said. “If you have somewhere else to go.” They shook their heads, opened the door, and got out. “You tell him I drove you today, yes? When you get back. You’re on a trip, yes? But tell him when you get back.” They waited for him to drive back down the unpaved road through the forest. “Don’t worry,” Vang said, and reached for the copper fish, wanting to touch it, but changed his mind. They headed in. The burst of a ceiling fan spinning above them. There was another fish in the small lobby, this one made of gold and standing on a pedestal. It was gleaming. The floors, too. Above them hung a chandelier. They caught the scent of flowers. The sound of trickling water. It was the most opulence they had encountered since the farmhouse, and they didn’t move, suddenly distracted by it all, until a young man standing behind the reception desk called to them and smiled. It wasn’t him. Behind the receptionist, on the wall, were room numbers and large hooks for the keys. All the keys were hanging on their hooks. Prany and Vang glanced at each other, and then they asked if there was a room available. From somewhere down the hall came faint music. A slow ballad Prany thought he recognized. “Only one?” the receptionist said, still smiling, looking at Prany and then Vang. “Yes.” The receptionist said if they wanted two separate rooms he could offer them a discount. “Are we the only guests?” Vang said. “Two rooms,” the receptionist said, ignoring him. “It might be more comfortable that way. And a discount.” “Only one,” they said. The receptionist regarded them, their clothes. He asked for identification. This was the moment they had been curious about. They had no identification. They had their papers, but they were supposed to be on a bus crossing the country by now. They opened the envelope and passed a handful of money over to him and said they had forgotten to bring their papers, that they were very tired from a long trip, that they were teachers at a school, and they were heading back home to Vientiane and wanted only to spend the night. They handed him another stack of money to be safe. Whatever the receptionist was considering was unreadable. They waited, holding their breath. The sound of trickling water seemed to grow louder. Then the young man took the money and selected a key from the wall. As he slid it across the counter, he asked if they needed help with their luggage. They said no. He smiled again. There were maps of the area on the counter if they wanted to take a walk. There were also flyers promoting “self-sustainability” with brightly colored illustrations of farms and lush grass. They asked if there was a restaurant, and the receptionist pointed down a hall. Then he looked around, leaned forward, and said, quietly, “Please. No sex stuff, okay?” They didn’t know how to respond to that. “Okay,” Vang said, and they went to the restaurant. There were five tables in the room. They sat in the corner by a window with a view of a small garden. They had the restaurant to themselves. Prany placed his hands on the tablecloth, feeling the texture of it. Outside, a child wandered along the garden path, shouting on occasion at someone they couldn’t see and pointing at the soil. They had seen so few people today, but it was still unbelievable to Prany to be seeing someone other than those they had seen for years. To see them unharmed. Unbelievable to see different clothes. To see a child. The receptionist appeared by their table, this time wearing an apron. He fumbled with a notebook and wet the tip of his pen with his tongue. They asked what the kitchen was serving, and he pointed behind him at a chalkboard on the wall. There were two things. Vegetables and rice. And, to their surprise, meat and rice. In the camp, they had never seen the animals they had raised after they had brought them across the fields to be slaughtered. The way their gaits changed as though they understood that something different was about to occur, and Prany unable to look at their eyes. They ordered four servings of each. The young man hesitated, wondering if he had misheard, so they said it again: four of the vegetables and rice, and four of the meat and rice. Then they asked what kind of drinks were offered, and they ordered everything he listed. Sodas, beer. They asked whether there was anything else in the kitchen that wasn’t on the menu. The receptionist had stopped writing. He said they probably had some papaya and some kaipen, and so they ordered all of that, too. They took out the envelope and gave him another stack of money. He pocketed the bills without looking at them and hurried away. They would do everything to get the manager’s attention. Outside, the child trampled a plant. Not long after, a young woman appeared in the garden and kneeled by the ruined plant and began to salvage as much of it as she could. She was perhaps Prany’s age and wearing slippers. Prany watched as she rolled up her sleeves to collect the dirt that had fallen on the stones of the path and carried it back over into the garden. Over and over she did this, somehow avoiding getting dirt on her clothes or even on her slippers. Prany studied her profile. Her patience. Her resemblance to the manager. There had been no mention of a family. Did it matter? It didn’t to him. He glanced at Vang, but the doctor was looking down at the section of the floor between his feet and rapidly tapping his chest with his fingers. Prany returned to the woman out the window: she brushed the dirt from her hands and left, ducking under the low branches of two trees. Where was the food? As the minutes passed, Vang still tapping his chest, Prany began to imagine that it was all a joke. Any moment now someone would appear and clap or begin to laugh, maybe Auntie herself would appear, and the lights would go out and the daylight would vanish. The woman and the child outside and this inn would vanish. The loudspeakers would blare, rattling their eardrums like a detonation, and it would turn out that they hadn’t left the prison at all, that this was another one of the guards’ games. That the man who had interrogated them for years was waiting for them in that same room that had turned Vang so quiet. For a moment, this seemed possible. But the food arrived, all of it. They could smell it everywhere now. They leaned over the table and ate, with shyness at first and then more violently. It was dry and not very warm, the meat was tough and the rice was almost raw, but they tasted flavors they had forgotten existed and ones they had thought of so often that Vang began to cry silently. He wiped his eyes and kept eating. They didn’t speak. They drank their beers and ate and opened the colorful bottles of Fanta and drank them, too, shocked by the sudden sugar, some of it spilling from their mouths onto their shirts. They kept eating and drinking. They ignored the receptionist watching them from the kitchen door. No one else came into the restaurant. They ordered more Fantas and beer and one more dish. When the receptionist came back again, they asked how the inn had meat, had all of this. They slid him more money, and Prany gestured out to the garden and the lobby. “The manager,” the receptionist said. “He knows people.” “Where is he?” Vang said. “He’s a good man. He takes care of us. My family. He’s a good man.” They slid him more money. “He hasn’t come in yet.” “When will he come in?” “Soon,” he said. “Tell him to come see us, yes?” Vang said. “Is there a problem? He’s a good man.” “No problem.” They had trouble finding their room, uncertain of how the numbers on the doors proceeded, but then they found the stairs and went up. They had been given a corner room on the second floor. The hallway smelled of damp wood. Prany took the key and tried the lock, but it wouldn’t turn. He tried again. They thought they heard footsteps and stopped, but no one came. Prany passed the key to Vang. The key turned. They stepped inside. There were two Western-style double beds. Red mattress covers. A brochure, trifolded and standing up. Vang laughed softly. Beds! They turned on the light in the bathroom and saw the folded towels and the toilet. A shower. Then they froze at their reflections in the mirror, their similar clothes, their gauntness, the deep hollows below their cheekbones, and their broken postures. Their age. They stood in silence, avoiding looking at each other through the mirror. They were just bones and old, older. They returned to the beds. Prany sat on the edge of the one closest to the window from which there was a view of the back of the inn, the paths, the hills. He waited for the child and the mother, but they didn’t appear. Prany took off his clothes and folded them carefully on top of the dresser. His working papers slipped from the pocket of his trousers and he knelt to examine them. He didn’t know what all the words meant. He tore the papers up, Vang’s, too, and flushed them down the toilet. He grabbed a towel like Vang had, wrapped himself in it, and went over to the bed. The room was small, but to them it was a palace. He thought he would walk around because he could, but like Vang, he ended up staying there on the bed. He reached over and held Vang’s hand. “What if he doesn’t come?” “He’ll come,” Vang said. “But if he doesn’t?” Vang didn’t answer. Prany kept holding his hand. He watched as the doctor breathed as slowly as he could. His own heart was pounding, but he focused on Vang’s breathing, the way they had practiced, matching his, and as they waited, he felt the shudder of his body against the towel, the soft mattress, his full stomach, this feeling as though he were falling and floating somewhere terribly far and deep and vast. He thought of Noi and the fruit he had dropped that had rolled down the banks of the river, the way he had chased after them, and he thought of how he had bashed his head against the wall one day in the cell, over and over again, until Vang woke, pinned him down, and held him. He remembered the soothing hum of a song coming from deep within the doctor’s chest as Vang tried to stop the bleeding with his shirt. Then a joke Vang made about how, in a cell, it was impossible for him to misplace his glasses. He saw that hall of mirrors in the farmhouse and the woman who had kept wanting to get up, forgetting she had lost the use of her legs. The way they had left her and so many others there, on that last day, unable to move them as they had fled. That day, so many years ago, he had gone back for them all. Alisak and Noi and Vang. In the chaos, he had driven back across the Plain of Jars, seeing smoke rising from a field. A farmer waved a pale shirt, indicating to him someone was alive. He only found Vang. By then, the helicopters had already gone. In their desperation, they had driven across the country, all the way to the Mekong, and had survived the crossing. He thought of the papers he had just torn up, floating in the toilet water. He imagined the life that had been given to them this morning and understood it would not have been all that bad. He felt the rhythm of going to work every day and helping a village grow food. It seemed good; it seemed okay. It was something he could have done. He knew how. He could do things like that now. He could grow food. He could help a village, and a village could help other villages. Maybe he should. Maybe the center had been right. Maybe what had been waiting for them was wonderful. He let go of Vang. Prany woke to footsteps. The sudden knock snuck into him and rattled his teeth. He crossed the room and peered into the eyehole. There he was. They had imagined this day for so long, but as he opened the door, they forgot to envision that the man standing in the hall would be, like them, older. Much older. That the man who had been their interrogator when they had arrived, the man who had used a hammer on their fingers and who had continued to torture them, had continued to torture Vang, had aged. His hair was thinner and gray. He had gained weight around his waist and was wearing a collared short-sleeved shirt with a tiny horse embroidered on it. He seemed, simply, like an old father. Someone healthy and at peace. It was clear the interrogator didn’t recognize them. They were sure he wouldn’t have. What had they been to him? So little. It had taken them two years to discover he had retired, had inherited this inn from an uncle. “I’m the manager of this establishment,” he said. “I wanted to personally welcome you to the Vientiane Prefecture, the most beautiful place here in Laos, the most beautiful place in the world. All praise, all praise, all praise.” “All praise, all praise, all praise,” they said. The interrogator looked over Prany’s shoulder at Vang. If he was disturbed that they were only in their towels, he hid it. He said, “Please let me know if there’s anything you need, and I will personally assist you.” Prany opened the door farther. He apologized for their appearance. He said they had stained their clothes and were waiting for them to dry. He gestured for the man to come in and offered him a chair by a small table in the corner. The interrogator stayed where he was, holding the bottle of whiskey he had brought with him. He offered it to them, but they declined. He wiped his brow with a handkerchief. His eyes stayed on Vang, who was by the window, and they waited to see if some recognition came. The interrogator shut the door behind him and locked it. He opened the whiskey and drank it himself. He asked where they were from. Whether they were enjoying their stay. He said he catered mostly to foreign diplomats and that it was rare to have guests of such means who weren’t here officially. That it was quite the honor for him. That he heard they were teachers, but he knew that was not true, though they need not worry, he was most discreet. Then, more quietly, he asked whether they needed entertainment. He said they looked like men who wanted to have some fun. He said, “You like the young entertainment? I know the young entertainment.” He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said again that he was most discreet. That he knew the best and the youngest. Fresh like the best fruit. “Fresh like the best fruit,” Vang said. Before the interrogator could say anything else, Prany and Vang stepped toward him, grabbed his arms and his head, and threw him down against the table so that his body was folded over the edge. They twisted his chin up, shoved a small towel into his mouth, lifted him back up, and slammed him down again. They pulled back on his arms as though they were levers, as hard as they could, hard enough that they heard both shoulders pop. The only sound that came from the man was a murmur of surprise, a grunt, and then his attempts at breathing as his body struggled. They had already broken his nose. Using their weight, they pressed down on the top half of his body as hard as possible, but Prany was already out of breath. There wasn’t a lot more strength left in him, he realized. Years in a cell. The two of them wrestling as quietly as they could to build up stamina. It wasn’t enough. Before panic could set in, the interrogator freed himself from them and collapsed onto the floor. They braced themselves for him to shout, but he didn’t. The towel that was still stuck in his mouth was already soaking up his blood. He crawled slowly toward the door, both of his arms dragging strangely along his sides. Vang grabbed his waist, pulled him back across the floor, and together they knelt and pressed their weight on him again. Because of Prany’s damaged hand, Vang was holding the hunting knife. He grabbed the interrogator’s hair and pushed his head down and began to stab the interrogator in his side, above his belt. The interrogator bit down hard on the towel and screamed, and his eyes welled up and reddened. He flopped like a fish. Prany shoved the towel deeper into the interrogator’s mouth and jammed his knee down against him. He watched as Vang kept stabbing him, faster, all across his side, the carpet beginning to grow wet. Vang’s glasses fell off, but he ignored this, kept stabbing. Then he leaned down and spoke into the interrogator’s ear as the body jerked. Prany didn’t hear what Vang said. He watched Vang’s mouth moving beside the ear and watched as Vang gripped the knife with both hands and pushed down into the back of the throat, the blade slipping down slowly at first and then softly. It was done. The interrogator went still. Vang let go of the knife, which was still in the man. It was like a piece of rock had sprouted from his neck. They took off their towels and pressed them against the interrogator’s body to soak up the rest of the blood. They headed into the bathroom, where Vang vomited, kneeling over the toilet. The Fanta and the beer and all the food he had eaten slushed into the toilet bowl. He shut his eyes. He laughed. He laughed louder, and Prany covered the doctor’s mouth. Prany turned on all the waterspouts, the showerhead, and the faucet. He helped Vang up, and they began to wash themselves. They opened all the shampoos and unwrapped the soaps and cleaned themselves and each other as fast as possible, as thoroughly as possible, all without looking in the mirror. They got back into the clothes they had come here with, the clothes that had been given to them. They looked once more at the interrogator on the floor, at his open eyes, the knife in him, his crooked arms. The wet carpet and the towels growing darker. They left the inn, the two of them crossing the lobby where there was still the faint music playing, and hurried past the courtyard and down the road through the forest. They didn’t look back. Vang handed Prany the rest of the money and said, “You find Auntie. You go.” They had forgotten to clean Vang’s glasses. Prany took them as they walked down the treelined road, trying to rub the blood away as quickly as possible. The scratches on the lenses were stained red. Prany’s breathing became erratic, and he began to shiver. And then he stopped and clung to Vang, pressing their foreheads together, wanting to be close to him one last time, wanting to hold him one last time. This man who was the only person he knew anymore. “And then you find your friend,” Vang said softly. He took back his glasses and put them on. “You find him. Go.” They parted by the highway. Prany walked back to the bus station and Vang crossed the road and shouted, once, up into the air, an animal-like noise, a bellow. His shape grew fainter as he descended the slope, headed home, to swim in the reservoir for the first time in his life. is the author of a novel, Snow Hunters, and, most recently, the story collection The Mountain.

        "story": "Bianca White, dressed in cream, was the first to arrive. All morning, she’d been looking forward to her lunch date with Ainsley Burton. In addition to being Bianca’s estranged best friend, Ainsley was the daughter of Bianca’s father’s vanquished presidential opponent, Marjorie Burton. And it was Bianca’s fervent hope that, over chopped salads and filet mignon at White International Hotel—Washington, D.C., she and Ainsley might restore a sense of equilibrium between their two families that had been lamentably lost over the past two years. Ainsley arrived minutes later. “Hey,” she said. Bianca rose from her chair, tilting her head in a manner that she hoped conveyed a winning combination of warmth, loyalty, and alacrity, mediated by the tiniest hint of regret for the obstacles that had been unwittingly placed in their mutual path. “Ainsley!” Bianca replied. “It has been too long. You look wonderful, as always!” Illustration by Katherine Streeter If only it were true. In fact, Bianca found herself instantly filled with opprobrium regarding the fact that her old friend appeared to be aging naturally. Why Ainsley had not had the laugh lines around her mouth injected with hyaluronic acid filler, Bianca couldn’t begin to understand. While it was true that, by definition, appearances were superficial, it also couldn’t be denied that first impressions made an impression. Bianca considered personal presentation to be an essential component of both her business and her life strategies. She leaned toward Ainsley’s left cheek, puckered her lips, briefly retreated, then reapproached Ainsley on the right side with a similar gambit. “Oh, please—but thanks,” Ainsley said, sitting down, then pulling in her chair with a screech. (Alarmed that Ainsley might be scratching the fine Italian terra-cotta tile that Bianca had personally selected for the second-floor steak house, Bianca couldn’t help but flinch.) “Anyway,” Ainsley continued, “here we are.” As she placed her napkin in her lap, she flashed Bianca a tight and not entirely warm smile that Bianca picked up on immediately. She wondered to herself whether Ainsley was still angry about the fact that, during the election season, Bianca’s father was perhaps somewhat less respectful toward Ainsley’s mother than he might have been. And, of course, there had been some unfortunate, long-term consequences. But while in hindsight, Bianca wished her father had found a different means of expressing his conviction that new leadership was needed at the country’s helm—in fact, thanks to Daddy, unemployment was at an all-time low—energy was a necessary component of all impactful campaigns, whether in fashion, real estate, or politics (Bianca’s three areas of expertise). And no one could deny that when Ronald White invoked Marjorie’s name, followed by a synonym for “the big house,” it invigorated his followers. Really, he had no personal animosity toward the woman. Surely, Ainsley knew this—and also that Bianca loved her father with the same sense of admiration, respect, and protective pity that Ainsley felt for her mother, who had lost the election twenty-four months before. “Ainsley,” Bianca replied, “let me first say how tremendously happy I am that you agreed to meet me for lunch. I have been intending to connect with you all year. But my schedule got away from me. Tell me first: How are your precious little ones?” Insofar as they were universally understood to be cute, children were, of course, a safe topic. “They’re great. How are yours?” Ainsley answered sourly. “As delicious and impossible as ever!” said Bianca. Yet it was in that moment that she realized her friendship with Ainsley Burton had truly suffered a bifurcation. Despite the two women’s extensive commonalities, from their famously virile fathers who’d been led astray in middle age by visually sub-optimum younger women to their upstanding Jewish husbands whose fathers were unfairly incarcerated for minor legal oversights, the two women’s shared aversion to spending long days with their children had always been their strongest link. Not that either one of them would ever have willingly divulged such preferences in public. But not very long ago, they’d admitted such things freely to each other. They’d shared other intimacies as well. Bianca still fondly recalled the two of them breaking the Sabbath together at her classic six on Park, martinis jiggling in their hands and babies bouncing on their knees, while, giggling and intoxicated, they’d compared their husbands’ sexual predilections. The sad truth was that, whether on account of time constraints or inclination, Bianca didn’t currently possess any close female friends. There wasn’t time. Perhaps there wasn’t inclination, either. Though she felt warmly toward her personal trainer (Maude) and hairdresser (Ling). Leaning forward in her seat, she gazed into her old friend’s eyes and said, “Ainsley, before we proceed, I just want to articulate that I have missed you tremendously.” No sooner had Bianca uttered the words, however, than she became concerned that Ainsley would interpret the sentiment as a concession of some kind. If Bianca’s father had taught Bianca anything in life, it was that winners did not apologize. “Thank you for saying that,” replied Ainsley, displaying the flicker of an actual smile, which gave Bianca hope. “But I just have to say that, given everything that’s happened, it’s not easy for me to sit here.” Anger and irritation swelled inside Bianca: Ainsley was acting so ungraciously! Suddenly, Bianca felt like getting up and leaving. She resisted the urge, but only just. “I am tremendously sorry you feel that way,” she said, grinning fraudulently at her former friend, “but before we further grapple with the subject at hand, will you excuse me for a moment?” Laying her hand on the arm of Ainsley’s woefully androgynous button-down, Bianca stood up and said, “I desperately need to utilize the ladies’ room.” “Of course,” said Ainsley. As she decided to walk to the bathroom, Bianca wondered why she had arranged the lunch. But then she reminded herself that it was to promulgate the compelling storyline that she was a woman for whom friendship was more important than politics. In fact, she’d intended to use this very line when she called Page Six that afternoon to plant a story about their meeting. Though she was also confident that someone in the restaurant would snap a picture of the two of them and upload it to Instagram, ideally accompanied by hashtags that referenced Bianca’s beauty, power, and grace (as opposed to her lack of qualifications, failure to have accomplished anything of note, and extensive surgical procedures). Bianca was photographed everywhere she went. For this reason, she carefully negotiated her fringe-bow, pointed-toe, high-heel pumps (designed by Bianca herself and currently on sale at Century21 for $49.99) out from under the table, rose to her feet, and began a leisurely stroll to the restrooms. Another invaluable lesson that Ronald White had imparted to his only daughter at an early age was that even if one’s eponymous fashion line was being “discontinued,” and even if Daddy’s chief of staff had recently urged one to keep a lower profile due to bad polling numbers, there was never a bad time or place to promote oneself and one’s brand. Yet, as Bianca ambled, she was beset by a brief moment of self-doubt: Were her DD breast implants too large for her frame and, as such, did they convey the wrong impression? That is, did she look more like one of her father’s special ex-porn star friends en route to a dollar store in Tampa than a genuine Park Avenue princess on her way to a trunk show at Van Cleef & Arpels? But no, that was impossible! Just then, Bianca became aware that multiple diners were busy capturing her image on their phones. Bianca’s confidence restored, she smiled to herself. Her security detail followed, albeit at a respectful distance. After Bianca left the table, Ainsley took a deep breath and imagined—in the words of her new meditation coach, Harris—“pulling energy in from the earth.” Since the election, she had been working with him on the concepts of centering and grounding, both of which Ainsley considered to be semi-bogus. Also, with his shiny pate and beady eyes, Harris looked vaguely like a serial killer. Nonetheless, she was willing to try anything that held out the promise of improving her terrible mood. Ainsley had spent her entire adult life honing her image as a regular, reasonable, well-regulated kind of person, the kind who used words like “Mom,” “gosh,” and “gee,” and who could make small talk about neutral subjects like the weather while waiting in line for a pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks. At times, she’d even come to believe she was that person. Yet if the events of the previous two years had taught Ainsley anything about herself, it was that at heart she was an expletive-hurling geyser of anguish and bile who possessed an overwhelming urge to trip and sucker-punch every asshole who walked by her on the street. Suddenly, Ainsley couldn’t even remember how long she was supposed to hold in her breath before she exhaled through her nose. Four seconds? Six? Eight? (Did it even matter?) In any case, yoga breathing wasn’t helping. Sitting there, waiting for her former best friend to piss fine perfume out of her delicately tapered urethra, Ainsley thought she might spontaneously combust into flames of frustration and rage. She just couldn’t get past the notion that, thanks to slander, innuendo, and Chinese bots spreading lies about her mother being Frankenstein’s bride, the White family had cheated her mother and, by extension, Ainsley herself out of a third term of the US presidency. (Ainsley’s father, Bob Burton, had held the office for eight years a decade earlier.) What’s more, Marjorie Burton was now in jail, and Ronald White was in the White House, which he’d recently renamed the Ronald White House. Even though Ainsley and Bianca had been close for seven years prior to the election campaign, it was hard for Ainsley not to hold her old friend responsible for the betrayal. The fact that Bianca could now sit across from Ainsley, ask about her children, and act as if nothing was wrong was jaw-dropping, really. Also, Bianca didn’t use contractions, such as “I’ve,” “isn’t,” “can’t,” and “don’t,” which drove Ainsley up the fucking wall. Ainsley wasn’t even sure why she’d accepted Bianca’s invitation to lunch—and at Bianca’s family’s conflict-of-interest-steeped hotel, which had been financed by gangsters from Uzbekistan. Or was it Kazakhstan? Ainsley had never quite gotten her “stans” clear—and she was pretty sure that Ronald White hadn’t either. He didn’t care. He’d take money from anyone. I could have at least insisted on another venue, Ainsley thought to herself. Then again, Ainsley knew that Bianca was her only hope for securing her mother’s release. Three months earlier, a federal judge had sentenced Marjorie to ten years for accepting hefty donations to the family’s charitable foundation from the Indian Ocean island archipelago of Seychelles (population: 94,000) in return for a favorable trade agreement. At the time, Marjorie had been secretary of commerce in the Black Administration. Never mind that no one even knew how to pronounce Seychelles. (Did it sound more like “seashells” or “satchels”?) Now she was killing time in a federal prison in western Connecticut. In the view of Ainsley and her family, as well as most members of the mainstream media, the case against Marjorie Burton should never have been brought. Although the Burton Foundation had accepted large sums of money from various oversea sources of dubious provenance, concrete evidence of a quid pro quo had never been found. But the White Justice Department had prosecuted the case anyway. And the Wolf News Network had devoted at least four hours a day to promoting it. At the end of a three-week trial, the jury had found Marjorie not guilty of thirteen of the fifteen counts but guilty of the other two, and a federal judge newly appointed by President White had imposed the maximum sentence of ten years in jail. Even with good behavior and parole, Marjorie was looking at serving at least seven years behind bars, unless Ainsley could persuade Bianca to persuade her father to issue a pardon. Ainsley knew she had to make the effort, even though secretly she felt somewhat liberated by her mother’s incarceration and regarded it as a relief that her mother was no longer in her life on a day-to-day basis, sucking up all the air in every room and leaving Ainsley gasping for stray oxygen molecules. Plus, as long as her mother was in jail, she didn’t have to listen to Marjorie’s oft-repeated Midwestern bromides about “hard work” and “good neighbors,” which she managed to combine with shame-free platitudes about “those people” who spent their spare time “watching Wolf News while under the influence of opiates” when not “spending their Friday paychecks on plastic crap at Walmart.” It wasn’t that Ainsley necessarily disagreed with this assessment. But at least she made an effort to disguise her snobbery and elitism. Finally, with Marjorie confined in another state, Ainsley was spared the daily agony of reliving the night of the election, when Ronald White had defied the polls to eke out a narrow victory in the Electoral College. Ainsley knew she would never forget the aura of shock and disbelief that hung over their sixteenth-floor “family suite” at the Marriott that evening, where Ainsley and her parents, seated side by side on a brown velour sectional, had watched the returns come in, while various advisers stood nearby whispering into their phones. As one by one the states on the board began to turn crimson, like wounds filling with fresh blood, Ainsley had racked her brain for something uplifting to say. But just as in the nightmares she’d had as a young child, when a flesh-eating monster would appear at the top of the attic stairs licking his lips, she’d been so stricken by terror that she couldn’t even scream. Ainsley exhaled, then glanced around her. What she saw was hardly novel—namely, tables of strangers whispering among themselves and shooting “discreet” glances in her direction. As if she wouldn’t notice their iPhones angled toward her. Since Ainsley had been a household name pretty much her entire life, she was usually unfazed by the attention. When she was born, her father had been the governor of Kentucky, and her baby photo, taken two minutes after her arrival on earth, had been plastered across the cover of the state’s biggest newspaper. Being Ainsley Burton, as she’d remarked to her husband early in their relationship, when she was trying to explain the tragicomedy of her life, was a little like being part of the permanent collection at a natural history museum featuring dioramas filled with depictions of loinclothed early man. And yet, she’d never fully ceased to find the invasion of her personal space an affront. It was one thing to be at a town hall meeting with her mother and have people gawking at her, another to be at an intimate lunch. Or was Ainsley kidding herself? Was there really any difference? And was the lack of privacy simply the price one paid for power? The truth was that, with the possible exception of the two years she’d spent in the UK working on her doctorate—the London-based tabloids mostly left her alone—Ainsley wasn’t sure what it would even feel like to be anonymous, or if she’d find it comfortable or enjoyable. Maybe if everyone forgot about her, she’d feel as if she didn’t exist. The somewhat paradoxical part of having been famous for as long as she had was that she’d never developed a particularly strong sense of self. If history remembered her at all, Ainsley suspected, it would likely be as Their Daughter. That was really the only identity she’d ever had. Marriage, motherhood, various advanced degrees, several official appointments—none of these things had changed the equation. Shortly before she’d wed her husband, Mike, five years earlier, Ainsley had briefly considered changing her last name to his (Levy), just as her mother had begrudgingly gone from being a Dunlap to a Burton in the late 1980s, the first time her father ran for governor and her mother was being attacked in all the state papers for being too much her own woman. But in the end, Ainsley had decided not to bother, not just because of the feminist implications but because she doubted her new surname would have stuck. No one was going to be fooled by her becoming Ainsley Levy—least of all Ainsley. She was perfectly aware that many people believed she’d spent her adult life profiting off her family’s name and connections. To Ainsley’s mind, this wasn’t a fair perception. Likewise, if it was power she now sought—yes, Ainsley was thinking of running for office at some point in the near future—it was the power to make a difference. (Mostly if not entirely.) Ainsley simply couldn’t understand why people were so mean about it when she raised the idea of occupying a political office of her own. Some families were in the cement business, others in dry cleaning (or real estate). Hers was in politics—just like the Roosevelts, the Kennedys, the Gores, and the Cuomos. America was a dynastic country. Why should the Burtons be different? Compared with Bianca, Ainsley thought to herself, she was a selfless philanthropist. Just last year, she’d published a book for young people on the contributions to science by disabled women of color. Bianca, on the other hand, never even pretended to have a noncapitalist motive for anything she did. And yet, in the run-up to the presidential election, Bianca, whose crowning achievement to date had been to lend her name to a bunch of shoddy handbags sewn in Indonesian sweatshops that paid their workers sixty bucks a month, had somehow been hailed as an “entrepreneur” and an advocate for female empowerment, while Ainsley’s attempts to raise money to fight cholera had been dismissed as the corrupt flailings of a spoiled daughter in possession of a sinecure. Just then, Ainsley’s phone pinged. After fishing it out of her bag, she held the screen to the light. Incoming was a new text from her nanny, Rihanna, about what her kids had eaten for lunch. Maybe it was neurotic of her, but Ainsley liked to keep tabs. “Great—thanks,” she wrote back, a thumbs-up emoji tacked onto the end. Except, when she looked at it again, she realized she’d texted the middle-finger emoji. “OH MY GOD I AM SORRY THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT!” she furiously typed. “Meant to send normal thumbs-up.” Rihanna answered, “N.P.” But did she mean it? What if Rihanna were mortally offended? Ever since election night, Ainsley had begun to suspect that none of the people who worked for her family, including her parents’ political advisers, ever told them the truth. For that matter, no one in her immediate family ever communicated his or her true feelings—except, of course, when it was her mother telling her father, when Ainsley was eighteen, that he was a lying, cheating piece of shit. Fortunately, it had been a few years since Marjorie had issued one of those tirades. Her father’s heart condition had made philandering a more challenging undertaking. And now Ainsley’s mother had no way of knowing what her husband was up to, since she was in prison, and Bob Burton had fallen into a depression and, as far as Ainsley knew, spent his days golfing on Jupiter Island with his celebrity friends. Ainsley opened Twitter to check her notifications. Earlier that morning, she’d tweeted out, “Transphobia has no place in the classroom or anywhere else,” with a link to an article about a trans girl-to-boy in Iowa who’d been bullied by his middle school classmates into attempting suicide. If nothing Ainsley tweeted ever seemed all that original or clever, then shocking and titillating her audience had never been her goal. Rather, she prided herself on regurgitating received wisdom and liberal pieties in new and pithy ways, especially on the subject of identity politics. To do so made her feel moral and relevant. Plus, in the back of Ainsley’s mind, she hoped the posturing might distract others from the uncomfortable fact that she and her husband lived like royalty yet had no obvious source of income. In any event, Ainsley was gratified to see that her transphobia tweet had garnered five thousand retweets and fifteen thousand likes. Next she checked to see if President White had tweeted anything egregious, outrageous, or just plain unhinged since the last time she looked. He had. Ten minutes earlier, referencing a rally of Ku Klux Klansmen and other white supremacists that had gathered on the Mall in Washington, he’d written, “Honest, hard-working Americans have the right to congregate for Causes they believe in! #1stAmendment.” Ainsley was disgusted and outraged at the president’s refusal to condemn these terrible individuals. At the same time, she realized it afforded her a good opportunity for a scathing social media post. After hitting the retweet button, she typed into the “add a comment” section: “Mr. President, With all due respect, racism is not a ‘cause.’ It’s a cancer.” Ainsley felt a surge of adrenaline, or maybe it was dopamine, coursing through her. She sensed this one would get a big response. Just then, Bianca’s giraffe-like form reappeared in Ainsley’s visual field. Ainsley felt her whole body tensing up—the dopamine had apparently run its course—and she had to remind herself to breathe normally. As she did so, she thought back to the night she and Bianca had met. Ainsley often wondered if Bianca’s befriending her, some five years before her father announced his candidacy, had been a calculated move on Bianca’s part to neutralize her opponent even before Ainsley realized she was one. She could still picture Bianca walking toward her, all spun-gold Rapunzel hair, dark flashing eyes, and projectile bosom. They were both at an all-women networking event/cocktail party at newscaster Leslie Winter’s chintz, gilt, and chinoiserie palace on Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park. The candlesticks had sterling silver ghouls at their bases. The waiters were wearing waistcoats and gloves, like lawn jockeys come to life. All around Ainsley, women seemed to be puckering their lips, extending their chicken necks, and leaning toward one another, while Leslie’s fleet of furry white-and-ginger Havanese lapdogs were scampering across the floor and, in one case, licking the toes of someone’s open-toed Louboutins. Leslie herself was gliding around like an ice skater doing figure eights, making sure everyone had something to drink and someone to talk to. She was already quite old, and if you looked closely you could see the stitch marks from her latest facelift through her thinning and coiffed dome of silver-blond hair. But she was still regal in her way. A lifetime of being on-air had taught her how to carry herself. “Am I interrupting?” Bianca began in a throaty, staccato baritone. Gazing into Bianca’s perfectly unblemished, oval-shaped face, Ainsley was reminded of nothing so much as an elongated molded-plastic toilet seat in bone. Bianca appeared to be wearing some kind of deep-V wrap dress that would have looked like Harvey Weinstein’s bathrobe on anyone but her and stilettos rendering her so tall that, in conjunction with her narrow hips and wide shoulders, she bore the faintest resemblance to a drag queen. Or maybe it was just that Bianca looked less like a woman than the Platonic ideal of one as pictured by a seventh-grade boy. “Not at all,” Ainsley said, smiling. “It seems as if every person in the New York metropolitan area, including my own husband, believes we are literally the same person and need to become best friends immediately,” Bianca enthused. “So I thought we ought to at least meet.” She stuck out her hand and, although there was no need for Bianca to introduce herself, given that she was a regular both on her father’s reality TV show and in fashion and lifestyle magazines, said, “Bianca White.” “Fair enough,” Ainsley replied with a quick laugh. “And nice to meet you.” She extended her own hand to meet Bianca’s and said, “Ainsley Burton.” Besides, if Ainsley had a brand, it was being unpretentious. Indeed, it was a point of pride that, as exceptional a life as she’d led, she was just like everyone else. Or at least she preferred to give that impression. It was the reason she purposefully wore the most nondescript clothes she could find. “Oh, my God,” said Bianca, eyes widening as she peered into Ainsley’s face. “How on earth did you get such gi-nor-mous blue eyes? You are so impossibly lucky.” They both knew it was a pantomime—and also who the Beautiful One was—but sure, let’s play pretend, Ainsley thought. Even so and despite her better instincts, Ainsley found herself flattered. “I don’t know about that,” she told Bianca with a light laugh. “But thanks.” “You are hilarious, too,” Bianca went on. “Let us get inebriated and tell each other our deepest, darkest secrets. Thursday evening. My house. Say yes. I will send my driver.” She smiled mischievously at Ainsley. Before Ainsley could answer or protest, Bianca switched gears. “But first, I must cop a feel!” For a split second, Ainsley thought Bianca was going to reach out and touch her breasts. Instead, she leaned down, blond mane falling over her shoulders, and scooped one of Leslie’s fluffy white dogs up and off the floor. Cradling the dog in her arms, Bianca began to run her immaculate whisper-pink nails down the back of its head, whereupon the entranced animal bore its hideous jagged teeth and emitted a strange guttural sound that reminded Ainsley of her husband right before he came. “Look at that, he’s totally in love with you,” Ainsley volunteered. Even the dogs were taken in that night, she later concluded. Bianca restretched her sleeveless sheath dress around her shapely backside and sat down at the restaurant table. She smelled of lavender and newly minted hundred-dollar bills. “So, you must tell me what you have been up to!” she said, blinking and smiling broadly at Ainsley, as if their brief but tense pre-ladies’ room exchange had never occurred. “I want to hear everything.” The whole world knew exactly what Bianca White had been up to lately—namely, helping her father upend democratic norms, destroy civil society, and bring the country to the brink of civil war. “Me? Just the usual craziness,” Ainsley replied. But it was a lie. The truth was that both she and Mike had been counting on Marjorie becoming president and were now struggling to fill their days. In fact, Ainsley had imagined herself sitting in the very West Wing office that Bianca was rumored to occupy, working on some kind of antipoverty initiative whose name included the word “global” and that would allow her to travel to faraway conferences and sit on stages with Bono sipping Evian. Meanwhile, Mike had been planning to open a new investment fund with the help of some of Marjorie and Bob’s biggest donors. Evidently, they were willing to overlook the fact that, in Mike’s last go-around in the hedge fund world, he’d lost nearly all his clients’ money by making bullish bets on the Venezuelan economy. It had been an unfortunate turn of events that Ainsley took pains to avoid bringing up with her husband, for whom the whole affair was clearly still a sore point. It was a sore point for Ainsley that Mike didn’t currently have a job. Was it too much to expect that he go out into the world and forge his own connections, separate from the Burton family? There had been a recent and brief foray into small-batch ice cream, but that hadn’t worked out, either. Nor did Ainsley have any idea what her husband currently did all day long behind the shut door of his home office. At this point, all she could hope was that it didn’t involve Pornhub. But maybe she was being too harsh. Even though she was getting close to forty, Ainsley wasn’t entirely sure what she was doing with her life either. Following her mother’s indictment, the Burton Foundation, once Ainsley’s main gig, had been shut down. “I’m actually producing a PSA about gender-nonbinary children living on reservations,” Ainsley told Bianca, “and how decisions regarding their bodily autonomy should be left to their tribal elders, not imposed by the patriarchal Western medical establishment.” “Forgive me—I am not following,” said Bianca. “Reservations for hotels or restaurants?” “No, Native American reservations,” said Ainsley. “Oh, of course.” Bianca nodded respectfully. Ainsley was relieved Bianca didn’t ask for any more details, since for now at least the film existed only in Ainsley’s imagination. “And I just joined the board of”—she name-checked a Fortune 500 company whose CEO was a close friend of her father’s—“and I’ve got about two thousand documents to go through for their board meeting next week in Houston.” In fact, there were actually only a couple of pages to go through, and four meetings per year. For that they paid Ainsley a six-figure salary. Which made her feel the teeniest, tiniest bit uncomfortable. And for all the interviews Ainsley had given about how much she loved being a mom, the truth was that she couldn’t wait until her kids grew up so that she could have intelligent conversations with them that were about something other than princesses and toy trains. Of course, she would have jumped in front of an actual train to save either one of them. But after four minutes of sitting on the floor making chuca-chuca noises, she sometimes felt like dying of boredom. She really only enjoyed spending time with them in the company of “Grandma,” whose visible joy at their existence proved semi-contagious and provided a kind of trick mirror to her own weariness. But Grandma wasn’t currently around. “I imagine you’ve got your hands full as well,” Ainsley said to Bianca, then wished she hadn’t. “That is indeed true,” Bianca faux-sighed. “I am actually leaving for Berlin on Monday to meet with the chancellor regarding a women’s business initiative I am launching with the IMF.” Well, aren’t you fucking important now, Ainsley thought but refrained from saying out loud. Instead, she quipped, “Oh, cool,” while nodding her head. “I’m sure that’ll be interesting.” “To be sure,” said Bianca. “Anyway—shall we look at the menu? I am beyond starving.” “As you may remember, I’m always happy to eat,” Ainsley mumbled in reply, then hated herself for having said so. She might as well have been wearing a sign pinned to her back reading, “Desperate Loser Who Drowns Her Sorrows in Food.” Why was she always putting herself down? Maybe it was because she’d spent a lifetime listening to others criticizing her. To Ainsley’s enduring consternation, when you googled her full name, the first thing that came up was the obscene cost of her Manhattan apartment. She understood why others might think it was tasteless that her and Mike’s condo spanned an entire city block while there was a homeless crisis going on, but it wasn’t as if Ainsley didn’t appreciate how lucky she was. (She did.) And her family had been growing. They needed more bedrooms, bathrooms, and closets. Was she really expected to be slumming it? While no one wanted to say it out loud, there were always going to be poor people and better-off people, unless you got rid of capitalism completely, and no one was in favor of that. Or at least no one Ainsley had ever met. Well, maybe except for Bernie Fucking Sanders. Besides, no one ever knocked Bianca for living in the lap of luxury. Somehow, it was okay for her to live in a $10million penthouse because her father owned the building but not okay for Ainsley’s parents to help their only child purchase a family-size apartment as a wedding gift. Or maybe it was just that no one could imagine that anyone who had hair and skin as nice as Bianca’s could possibly be evil. Ainsley was once again seized by rage. “Back to what I was saying before,” she said quietly. “It isn’t easy for me to sit here.” “No—I understand,” said Bianca, nodding her head dutifully. “It makes sense—that you would feel aggrieved on some level. But alas, someone must win and someone must lose. That is the nature of competition! I wish it were otherwise.” She smiled congenially. “I don’t feel hurt because my mother lost the election,” Ainsley said carefully. “Well, what is it then?” asked Bianca, eyebrows up near her hairline, lips pursed. As if she didn’t get it. But that was impossible. She was an intelligent woman, Ainsley thought. There was no way she didn’t understand. “It’s that your dad got the FBI to investigate my mother after he won,” Ainsley hissed, “which ultimately led to her conviction and imprisonment on a bullshit charge by a right-wing judge from the Federalist Society. That’s not okay. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a Central American dictatorship. Here in America we don’t put our political opponents in jail. Or at least we didn’t used to. Plus, you claim to care about women and women’s issues, yet every step of the way you’ve gone along with your father’s platform, which advocates separating undocumented mothers from children and packing the courts with right-wing ideologues who want to curb women’s reproductive rights. Never mind that you actively campaigned to prevent our country from having its first female president.” There was silence at the table. It occurred to Ainsley that, quite possibly, other diners were listening in. Although as a general rule she was keen to keep her private conversations from public view, at that moment she didn’t care. Let anyone quote her who wanted to do so, she thought. “I understand why you might perceive the situation that way,” Bianca said slowly. “But my father has the utmost respect for women. There have always been many high-ranking females at the White Corporation. And now there are many at the Ronald White House as well. I chose not to support your mother for president not simply out of loyalty to my family but because I truly believed and continue to believe that my father’s policies and experience are better suited to fostering a robust, pro-business environment that will ultimately empower female entrepreneurs. Do I agree with everything he says and does? Of course not. But I believe he is a person who wants the best for America. Also, my father did not imprison your mother. He may have alluded to his desire to do so during rallies and debates, but it was as much a rhetorical device as anything else. Ultimately, it was a jury of citizens who found her guilty. And Judge Lawton, who presided over the trial, is an eminent jurist. My father would have respected any verdict that was delivered.” Every bone in Ainsley’s body longed to reach across the table, wrap her doughy hands around Bianca’s swan neck, and squeeze until the last breath was sucked out of her. To prevent herself from doing so, and because women like Ainsley had been raised to be nice, polite, respectful, and good-natured, and to not make a scene, she sat on her hands, smiled hostilely back at Bianca, and said, “Right.” Also, she still needed Bianca on her side. “Well, to be perfectly honest, the main reason I accepted your invitation to lunch today was to ask you—a woman whom I once counted among my closest friends in life—to ask your father to overturn that supposedly impartial verdict and pardon my mother, not just for the good of my family but for the good of democracy.” Bianca’s face froze. She looked as if she’d been asked to scrub a urinal. Curling her nose in distaste, she announced, “I will make inquiries. But I cannot promise anything. I have only limited say over my father.” “Thank you,” said Ainsley, who had no reason to believe that her entreaties would lead anywhere. But at least later she could say she’d tried. “It would be appreciated. And if you don’t mind, I’ll follow up in a week or two. I assume you’re still using your BJFamily.com email address?” “Yes,” Bianca answered tersely. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m afraid I’ve lost my appetite,” said Ainsley, unhooking her handbag from the back of her chair and standing up. “I thought you said you were always happy to eat,” said Bianca. “That was before,” Ainsley replied, walking away. She checked her Twitter account en route to the door. Six thousand likes and counting. (Not bad.) Ainsley Burton had always been the difficult type, thought Bianca, shaking her head as she dug into her greens. She would do what she could to talk Daddy into pardoning Ainsley’s mother, if only to keep the peace, but her hopes were not high. Daddy believed in the law, except of course when he didn’t. Her father could be capricious that way. In truth, it was not always easy working for him. Then again, it would all be over soon. After he was impeached, Bianca was planning to quit both Judaism and Jason, both of which bored her to tears, and move her family and staff to Paris. She had always dreamed of trying her hand at writing a novel. And with its rich literary tradition, Montparnasse seemed like the perfect place to do it. With any luck, Jason would go to jail, making joint custody impossible. Bianca imagined sitting cross-legged at an outdoor marble bistro table with a wrought-iron base, sipping a double espresso while scribbling in a notebook filled with onionskin paper. She would already have published two non-fiction titles, but her third—a love story set amid the violent convulsions of the Crimean War—would hopefully be the one for which she was remembered. She felt she had things to say about the world and, if immodesty was allowed, an extensive vocabulary with which to say them. n is the author of five novels, most recently Class (Little Brown, 2017), a satire about public school and the liberal bubble.

        "story": "Years ago, Ellie asked me to write the story of our friend Addie and the chili. The incident involved some bowls of chili, and more than one woman crying, in fact several women crying, and also had something to do with our country’s political mistakes, and the mistakes we ourselves make with our children. “Addie and the Chili,” I was going to call it, because sitting in the middle of the scene were three bowls of chili on the restaurant table, or rather two bowls and one cup, the cup being mine. I made an attempt at writing the story and then gave up. I don’t know whether the story defeated me or I simply became distracted by other things. I was a single mother at the time, and trying to support myself and my child. I was trying to write stories at the same time as I was working and caring for my child, and I often did not finish what I started. Now, more than thirty years have gone by, and I’ll give it another try. “Untitled #11,” by Laura Letinsky, from the Albeit series. Courtesy the artist and Yancey Richardson Gallery, New York City I ordered only a cup of chili, not a bowl, because I was upset and thought I would not be able to eat more. I was upset by the movie and by Addie. Addie ordered a bowl when she was still in a good mood, talking her head off, before she knew what I was going to say to her, and then, after I said it, when the waiter set the bowl down in front of her, she could not eat any of the chili, or at least she said she could not. As for Ellie, she ordered a bowl because she was very hungry, despite being, like me, upset by the movie and by Addie. She finished her bowl quickly, though I didn’t notice her eating. Maybe she was eating her chili while I was reproaching and insulting Addie and Addie was reacting—too hungry to wait. Ellie then sat there, still hungry, staring at Addie’s untouched bowl. She told me later that she had wanted to ask Addie for it, but did not, because she knew how offensive it would be to ask a woman in tears for her chili. What started the trouble was the movie Ellie and I saw earlier in the evening. It was a recently released movie about some devastating things that had happened in another part of the world that had caused a great many children to suffer. Or rather, everyone suffered, old and young, but the movie showed the children especially, and it is always hard to accept the idea of children suffering at all. Things had also been happening in Ellie’s life and in my life that made us more vulnerable than usual to such a film, although I can’t remember now what those things were, and we came out of it exhausted by the sustained grief of the story. Others in the audience were clearly just as upset. Two men were evidently not able to leave the theater at all, and sat there side by side staring straight ahead at the empty screen. Women I saw in the line to use the ladies’ room had been crying or were still crying, or trying not to cry. Then we walked from the movie theater to pick up Addie where she was living nearby, in a brownstone, and as soon as she came down the front stoop she began talking about herself. Addie always talked mainly about herself, and she probably still does—I don’t know her anymore, though not because of that evening. I try to think why Ellie and I remained friends with her. It must be that at times she did talk about other things, and said intelligent things about subjects that Ellie and I were both interested in. As she began talking about herself, on this night, she further upset me by addressing her remarks exclusively to Ellie, at least in the beginning. As I listened, I became very angry, though I kept quiet. I was angry at Addie for what she was saying, the way she was saying it, and what that told me about her life and her character, but there was more going on, there were other things feeding into my anger at Addie. I was angry at everything that had happened in the film, everything that had happened that day to me, and that week to me, and several things concerning my child, and several things concerning two friends who had attempted to commit suicide just the week before and which I had heard about, in one case directly from the friend herself—how she had managed to call 9-1-1 and had been carried from her apartment on a stretcher. It had not been a good couple of weeks, there in the dead of winter, and my anger at all of it boiled up in me when Addie began telling us something involving a lover, a story she clearly believed to be tragic and exciting, with herself at center stage, but that was, to me, and probably to Ellie, only dull and sordid. It is possible that on another evening, after a different couple of weeks and a different film, or even at a different time of year, in midsummer out on the sidewalk, with a warm breeze blowing, I might have been interested in this story about an angry lover, phone calls at three and four in the morning, the offering of a bouquet of flowers, the bouquet torn from the vase and thrown in her face, the demand for the repayment of fifty dollars, the subsequent humiliation on the lover’s part, his begging for forgiveness, and probably the forgiveness withheld. (I remember everything but that last—whether Addie forgave him.) One of the things we must have enjoyed about Addie, in fact, was her often absurd tales of love affairs. I remember only one longtime lover, or perhaps even husband, who used to cradle her feet in his lap and groom them, which I thought rather touching and which did not fit with what was otherwise the style of her love life. But on this evening, as we walked toward the restaurant, with a bitter wind blowing and slush at the curb, I was ready to give up on our plan to have dinner. I was ready to leave for home, though my small apartment would hardly have been inviting, and would have felt particularly empty since I had not planned to be there at that hour. I said I was tired and going home, but I was persuaded to stay, not only by Ellie, because she did not want to be alone with Addie, I’m sure, but also by Addie, no doubt because she wanted more of an audience than Ellie. We went into the restaurant and sat down. As I began to read the menu, while Addie continued talking, I discovered that I was crying and did not want to eat or drink or talk. I made up my mind, then, to speak frankly, because I could not pretend that nothing was wrong. I then turned to Addie and told her that there was something I wanted to say. She looked me in the eye, and her expression was fiercer than I had expected, as though she knew in advance that something unpleasant was coming and had resolved not to listen to me. Before I could go on, however, the waiter came up to our table, a tall young man with chubby arms, and said, “What can I do for you ladies?” That was when we ordered the chili, and the waiter did not seem very pleased. When he left, Addie looked at me again, and I went ahead, though I did not think that what I said would have much of an effect. I said I was offended by her, I was offended by the way she came out of her house and did not first ask us how we were and how the movie was, or even look carefully at us or think of us before she began to talk about herself and tell us her story. I said that she should try to read our mood and be sensitive to us, that she was so wrapped up in herself she hardly saw us, that she did not seem to care about us but only saw us as an audience for her. Right away she said she could not hear any more and began to cry. Then I saw that by her reaction she had made me look mean and that she had also held on to the center stage, remained the star, though now in a different drama. Now I was yet another of the people who had wronged and hurt her. She said she was going to leave and took out money to pay for the chili. I don’t know what I had imagined her reaction would be—contrition, shame, apology? Ellie began trying to make peace between us. I, too, thought I would have to keep her there and let her tell her story sooner or later, or the evening would be spoiled anyway. I’m not sure that I would, now, feel the same way I did then, so it is hard for me to understand my reaction then. Now I would probably have let her go, and written her off, and spent the rest of the evening talking with Ellie. But in any case, I did what I could to mollify her, though I was annoyed doing it. I did what I could to get her back to her story and draw her out. It was not working. I did feel better now, though, having said what was on my mind, and I ate my cup of chili easily and was sorry I had not ordered a bowl. Then, because I was tired of trying to persuade Addie to talk, I turned to Ellie. We talked about trips we were both going to be taking soon, and then jobs that Ellie was having trouble getting, and then a certain man’s opinion of her that she was worried about—she said that when she had nothing else to worry about, she worried about what this man thought of her. Meanwhile, Addie sat with her head bowed, dabbing at the surface of her chili with her spoon and sniffling. So then I turned to Addie again, and persuaded her to tell us what had been happening that day with her lover and she began to talk again. She talked about not only this lover, but a gourmet chef she had picked up on the street and who had come to see her that morning between eight and nine o’clock. She talked then about another man, a busy screenwriter who wrote her long letters even though he lived right here in the city. During this, Ellie did not say a word. She had finished her chili. Maybe she was cross because she had not asked Addie for her chili and she was still hungry. She kept looking at Addie’s chili. But I think she was also becoming truly angry herself now, because Addie was doing just what she had wanted to do in the beginning and what was really so offensive to both of us—talking her head off to a captive audience about the men who loved her. I will ask Ellie if there is more that she remembers, but after all, I see why the story was difficult to write—most of all because, as is true of many stories in real life, not much had happened. All that had happened was that certain emotions had shifted around from person to person over that hour or so. Addie started out cheerful, became angry and hurt, and then recovered her good cheer. I started out upset by the movie, became more upset and angry, and then felt better once I had spoken my mind to Addie, though subsequently annoyed by her manipulation. Ellie started out upset by the movie, became angry at Addie, though not as angry as I was, recovered her equanimity in attempting to act as mediator in the conflict between me and Addie, and then, in turn, once Addie recovered her good spirits and I attempted to placate her, became even angrier at Addie. But it is interesting, in its own way, to think about what happens after a movie is made and people see the movie. A movie is made depicting how badly people are hurt in a war, and it is skillfully made, so that it affects the people who see it. They cry or nearly cry, or simply feel their grief and shame without showing it. And when the movie is over, they disperse, they go off in different directions. And some of them may have trouble eating, then, and also vent their emotions on their friends, whose failings seem less forgivable after what was depicted in the movie. Now I’ve asked Ellie, but she has forgotten the evening entirely, and certainly does not remember asking me to write about it. It is strange that I was so sure she would never forget it. But, prompted by my question, she thought hard and remembered Addie’s full name, and then looked her up, which I had not done, and located her, now living in Europe. For me, Addie had dropped out of existence once I no longer knew her. Ellie discovered that Addie has even done some rather interesting things. Our lives go on, years pass, we start things and finish them, year by year, things add up to our credit. Maybe that is why we were friends with her for as long as we were—not only because she and her stories amused us, but also because she had some interesting ambitions, and was not unintelligent, besides also being so silly and self-absorbed. Though all three of us could be that, she was the silliest of us. As for what happened to Addie’s chili, that evening, she asked the waiter if he could wrap it up for her so that she could take it home. We did not much like the waiter, in part because he clearly did not much like us—these three women arguing and crying, who had ordered nothing more than some chili. He said the restaurant had no containers for that, “as such,” but that he would wrap it up for her the way it was, in the bowl, and ask her to bring the bowl back. She lived nearby, she could return the bowl the next day, and that is what Addie did, as far as I know.

        "story": "I had finished lunch when I decided to attend the memorial service later that afternoon for Juno Wasserman, who had died the week before, just shy of seventy. Juno had been with my mother at Vassar and Harvard, and I thought I should go at the very least to be able to tell my mother about it, for though they had fallen out I think they still considered each other best friends, and my mother had been in a great self-pity over their lack of resolution. The service was taking place in a Buddhist meditation studio, in a loft near Union Square. In the tiny hallway leading to the small, slow freight elevator was a crush of people who gave off the smell of coming in from cold air. Their presentness was an absolute contrast with the nullity of death: no looking down, no living on, all electricity gone. The door to the stairwell was locked, and when a man suddenly came out through it none of us thought fast enough to catch the opening. Along with the waiting crowd of Juno’s people there was another group, of uniformly pretty young women, and when we got on the elevator I noticed they looked like movie temptresses or homecoming queens. Some combination of the mourning, the mismatched crowds, and the tight squeeze made certain that it was a silent ascent, and when my phone began to buzz it was the loudest thing in the elevator, a frantic, petitioning vibration I’d assigned to my mother. Cat in the Night, by Olive Ayhens. Courtesy the artist I tried to look around without moving to see if I recognized any of Juno’s crowd, whether they were friends from Vassar or grad school, whom my mother would also have known, or from Buddhist retreats in Thailand, or downtown never-really-made-its who’d had a future for a couple of decades starting in the mid-Sixties, or other folklorists, or weirdos Juno had collected during tale-gathering trips—to Illyria and Patagonia and Formosa and other romantic place names that never were or no longer are the names of countries but still feel like they should be—who later found their way to New York. (There were none I knew, but one of the models I was able to place from the Christmas J.Crew catalog.) Juno had been born June but, being angry and tireless like the goddess, didn’t want to have such a quiet name. She never legally changed it, and having gone back and forth became consistent only in her early fifties, beyond the point of retraining her friends. Juno always bristled when my mother slipped up, which I suspect she did partly on purpose. Juno in turn called my mother “Debbie,” which had otherwise been shed by grad school. I sat in a folding chair that turned out to be taken by a wiry-haired man who smelled of camphor, and I found another chair at the back next to Juno’s qigong teacher, a fleshy, extremely alive man whose metaphysical refinement seemed in tension with the vessel. Juno’s nieces and nephew played a Beethoven string trio. Then came a recording of Juno reading a fairy tale about the Angel of Death and the pious man: one day the Angel of Death comes for him and announces that it is his time. I’d heard her perform it onstage before. On tape her voice sounded thinner, and the different voices she did sounded a little silly without facial expressions to match. “The man said, ‘As God wills it, so I shall comply. But tell me, for pity’s sake, I have three young daughters, and the eldest is a simpleton. Surely God might show mercy and allow me to live only long enough to secure her in marriage.’” (The story went on in the same slightly antiquated translation. The subject might have been on the nose in terms of the memorial, but for Juno to read someone else’s version of a story verbatim was at odds with the usual way she worked.) The Angel says that “God’s will cannot be broken but that He intends it,” and gives the man a challenge. If he can answer a certain very difficult question, then he is meant to see his daughter wed. The question is: what did the man’s mother place next to him as he slept, on the day he turned two? (I felt a chill of excitement when I heard this line, because I remembered, or at least remembered being told, what my mother handed me in bed the morning of my second birthday: two big gumballs which she’d brought back from America.) “And thus the Angel of Death departed. “The man could not remember. At dawn the next day, as he tended his goats, he lamented, ‘O you goats, whosoever can answer Death’s question, let him speak.’ The goats held the man dear, for he had always tended them finely and plucked their burrs and delivered their young. The goats said, ‘The answer you seek is the hyacinth. Now be quick, for Death comes.’” I picture this Death as some kind of Muslim-flavored Balkan grim reaper who is interchangeable with whatever the relevant Hebrew Bible angel would be. Anyway, here there was a loud pop and a change in the timbre of Juno’s voice, and for the rest of the recording she sounds older, as if two audio tracks from decades apart were spliced together. The Angel of Death arrives and asks the man the question, and the man answers, and Death praises God and departs. The man weds his simpleton daughter to a simple man, and they are happy and blessed. Then Death comes back, because it’s definitely the man’s time, but now the man would just like to see his homely middle daughter wed. So Death gives him another question: “On the day you turned but one year old, your mother placed in your mouth a gift. What was it?” The man can’t answer. At dawn the next day, as he tends his horses, he laments, and the horses, who are also fond of the man, tell him that it was a quail egg. Death comes, the man answers correctly, Death praises God and departs, and the man’s middle daughter—“homely but good”—is married to a merchant. At this, the qigong teacher hummed assent and nodded his head forward over folded arms. When the wedding is over Death returns, and the man now wants to marry off his third and final daughter, the youngest, who is beautiful. So now the Angel’s question is: “On the day you were born, your mother whispered something in your ear. What was it?” The Angel departs, and the man can’t remember. At dawn the next day, he is feeding his chickens and he laments, and although the chickens hold him dear, apparently “Chickens are foolish, and only the cock who heralds the call to prayer can speak.” (I didn’t remember this twist in the story from my previous listening, and my guess about how the man would get out of the trap—by offering a benediction to God’s own Angel—was wrong.) The Angel of Death arrives and asks. The man can’t answer the question, and he’s shaken that Death has turned up earlier than the other two times. He says only, “I did not know that you would come so soon.” Death praises God and departs. For these were the words the man’s mother spoke into his ear. The man marries off his beautiful daughter, who is “radiant like the sun itself,” to a prince, and they are happy and blessed. Rebecca, Juno’s daughter, said some things that took a prescribed form, filled in with personal details. I was thinking that the fairy tale did not quite line up. Juno had only one daughter, not three, and that one was not a simpleton at all, and was neither plain nor pretty but something else. Juno’s brother who was in attendance said something in passing about another brother, not there. A friend from Buddhist study who had been in regular practice with Juno for some ten years recited a prayer, a translation of a traditional sutra, and standing silently next to her as an “anchor” was this Southern woman who once, in Juno’s back yard in the Village, when I’d moved to New York just after college and for the transitional period been in regular touch with real adults who knew my parents, held forth on Margaret Mitchell and how great she was for not being racist in 1930s Atlanta. Rebecca and the brother stood for the mourner’s kaddish, and, at the end, Rebecca’s husband said they would be having shivah at their home for three days, come on by. Having, not sitting, which I hadn’t heard before and haven’t since. Imoved to America with my mother just after she’d separated from my father. She’d not wanted to lean too heavily on her own mother, who was by then living out in Mamaroneck, so we stayed at Juno’s two-story garden apartment, in a town house on a gated cul-de-sac, off Sixth Avenue, where e.e.cummings once lived. I was six. I watched the WWF in the dim, warm living room for days and days. Juno worked in her study facing onto the garden. When my mother went out, which was often—she said, or I inferred, that she needed to restart her life here—Juno fed me PB&J sandwiches or vegetarian sushi rolls she’d learned to make in Hokkaido. (I wonder now at what extent of my permanence in the United States the legal obligation to send me to school would have kicked in.) When we left the apartment, Juno and I, something always felt a bit seasick in the universe: a station wagon sat impaling a wall of the diner at Sixth and Waverly, patrons in the restaurant ignoring it. Men were breaking into parked cars in the West 30s outside the Lincoln Tunnel in broad daylight, unchallenged. A platform-level shop in Penn Station sold giant combat knives to commuters. A rock broke the window over Juno’s desk. The back yard was open only to other residents of her cul-de-sac and of the mews running through the block. She was very upset. The next day was her teaching gig at Columbia, so she took me uptown and left me with the department secretaries. By the time we got back downtown there was a letter on the door from her landlords in lieu of an eviction notice from the city marshal, stating that she had violated the terms of her lease so they had moved her stuff out, etc. The rock was the landlords’ doing: when Juno had patched the glass pane herself, they claimed, that became a disallowed modification, in breach of the lease. Juno had been there under rent control for more than twenty years, and the owners had made a few lazy gestures throughout her tenancy toward getting her out, but it had been mostly the attrition of neglect. This was a distinct escalation. Juno took me to the upstairs neighbor and began making lots of phone calls. The neighbor put on the WWF for me. It was the championship that day. (I believe the Ultimate Warrior lost because the ref had been knocked out when Warrior bested Hulk Hogan, who regained control of the match as the ref regained consciousness.) I was learning to read then and I kept looking at a book of Juno’s, a collection of folktales from a place I’m not sure of, and reading one story in that book. A mouse is married to Mistress Beetle, who dies by falling into her cooking pot when her husband is out of the house, and each new character, upon hearing this news, makes a show of mourning in some way and passes along the accumulated account to a new character, so that at the end it goes like this: The old woman hung a griddle from her neck and went back into the house. “But Auntie, have you gone mad?” said the people in the house when they saw her. “Auntie has put a griddle round her neck,” said she, “Mistress Ant has rent her veil, Grandpa has put a spade through his body, the ibex have dropped a horn each, the hyacinth has shed her blossoms, the spring has turned red as blood, the quail has molted her feathers, the plane has shed its leaves. A curse on the tail of the mouse, the water has killed Mistress Beetle!” The people rose up and pulled the house down and ran away, and they happened then to see the body of Mistress Beetle, and they keened and moaned and buried her body to the sound of tambourines and drums. Each of them went off in his or her own way, and they became wanderers on the face of the earth out of grief for Mistress Beetle. Juno pretty quickly tracked down the moving company that had been hired to take away and store her belongings. She feared they would be in a terrible state, and she would be proved right. My mother had gone to Poughkeepsie, so Juno had to take me with her. The station wagon entered the throaty hum of the Holland Tunnel and then the sudden bright yawn of New Jersey. We got lost. I was already good at reading maps and following directions, whereas Juno was terrible, and she had the good humor and steady patience to discuss the directions with me. We found the warehouse in what might have been Elizabeth, or Bayonne. The building was cavernous and sectioned off by sheets of dirty canvas tensioned between weights on the floor and metal joists below the roof. It had a smell of spilt motor oil and adult men that I hadn’t smelled since India. In locating the boss from the phone call, we took further wrong turns before we found a small office that, amid the soaring space, felt like the inside of a refrigerator turned sideways, or like the plush, quiet, Detroit-built boat that had ferried me from JFK to Juno’s weeks earlier. It was full of papers and smoke. The boss was an old man, fifty or seventy, short, white, bald, sour. He said he couldn’t do anything, her possessions still had to be inventoried, and then if she verified ownership she could arrange to pay for them to be moved somewhere. Juno wanted to see paperwork, so he showed her a copy of the same iffy eviction letter. She showed him a copy of her lease and said he knew full well that the eviction wasn’t legal and the letter wasn’t sufficient. She wanted to see her things, so he took her to the loading dock. Her stuff was just piled out there, sitting in the cold late-October early-evening air. Some of it was visibly damaged. Juno’s entitlement to these objects was wearing down the boss’s posture. There were drawers with family photos, and we found many of Rebecca, who was then around thirteen, living that year with her father in New Haven. There was also a Steinway baby grand, Juno’s father’s from the Thirties, when he played on Broadway and toured the Borscht Belt. Juno volunteered to recite the serial number if anyone wanted to lift the top and check it, though nobody had said it wasn’t hers. “No way I’m moving that fucking thing again,” said the boss. From the highways nearby was a swirling like putting your ear to the chest of the world. He asked whether she played, gesturing to the piano, half curious, half showing his willingness to waste time. Not really, she knew a few things. She was half being modest and half trying to shut down the tangent. But he kept at it. He asked if she knew a particular song. To tell what happened next is frustrating on two points. First, I don’t know the exact arrangement Juno and the boss came to, but now that Juno is dead let’s assume that he offered, once she had her place back, to do the return move for free, as she wanted, on the condition that she played the song he had named. Second is that nobody, not even Juno when she was alive, could remember what the song was. When I was in high school visiting colleges out East with my mother, we stayed with Juno. But just a day in, three days before we were set to head up to Boston, Juno told my mother she’d been confused about what dates we were meant to be there, and other houseguests were expected, professional acquaintances Juno knew less well, so we’d have to figure out something else. The offense stayed with my mother, and a few years later, when Juno was to perform her magnum opus at full length—a pre-Islamic Persian epic about a warrioress, spanning eight hours with three intermissions (never before or since staged both in its entirety and in a single day, but Juno had funding and city support in those richest of the Giuliani years)—I came down from New Haven for the show, and my mother had planned to come, she was visiting friends in Princeton but in general the trip was scheduled to coincide with the performance, and I knew, each of the three times the lights came up and I looked around and noted whoever was sitting near me, including a group I later identified as members of Iran’s exiled royals expertly killing time, that she would not be there. Juno sat on an old dining chair with a cane back, and she tried a few keys, glaring at the boss because something had definitely gone wrong with the tuning. Before she began, he asked her to wait a minute and went inside the warehouse, then came back out with half a dozen men. One of the men brought a hand truck for me to sit on and put a moving blanket around me, the air was getting colder and it was getting dark, and then she played. The music was confident and the old sodium-vapor lights were like another blanket. Was it a show tune, something from Fiddler on the Roof, My Fair Lady? What would that guy have asked for? Tosca, Springsteen, Sinatra? To me it was just piano. Juno played, and at the end they clapped, the scene was perfect, and for the first time ever I saw the New York skyline lit up in the distance, and for the first time I felt that wonderful sinking rising life-proud world-weary inspired gutted feeling of coming back to the city at night. Before leaving the service, I wrapped some cookies, one ginger and two chocolate chip, in a napkin. I took the stairs, and when I came out the stairwell door into the narrow hall at the bottom I held it open and explained to some models who were waiting that a lot of people were coming down from the eleventh floor and so it might be a while for the elevator. I held the door encouragingly, but the models remained uncertain, so I let go of the handle and it, too, hesitated for a moment before closing. As I walked outside, into the dim winter canyon with the cornices of buildings still catching sunlight up above, I rummaged in my bag for my phone. There were actually three calls from my mother, and I could tell immediately, from the fact that each one had produced a voicemail three minutes long, the maximum possible length, that all of the calls must have been accidental, dialed from her purse or her pocket. I was about to delete them but then it occurred to me that I might listen to what she had recorded, whether she was talking to someone else or moving through the world without speaking.

        "story": "He is a nondescript man. I’d never used that adjective about a client. Not until this one. My seventeenth. He’d requested an evening time and came Tuesdays at six-thirty. For months he didn’t tell me what he did. The first session I said what I often said to begin: How can I help you? I still think of what I do as a helping profession. And I liked the way the phrase echoed down my years; in my first job I’d been a salesgirl at a department store counter. I want to work on my marriage, he said. I’m the problem. His complaint was familiar. But I preferred a self-critical patient to a blamer. It’s me, he said. My wife is a thoroughly good person. Yawn, I thought, but said, Tell me more. I don’t feel what I should for her. What do you feel? Gratitude, I suppose. And when I think of leaving, pity. Photographs © Joseph S. Giacalone What do you wish you experienced? He slumped in my old chair. (I’d just signed the lease; the furniture I’d ordered hadn’t come yet.) I don’t feel enchantment . . . or the hope that we can make each other better. Married ten years, together thirteen. But I never had that. That being enchantment. He shrugged. All the things people say about being in love. Inever felt she was necessarily the one, he said. The one, I repeated. That we were destined for each other. Do you have children? Three. How about you, Doc? Do you think love is just a solitary fantasy system? I believe in the existence of good fits, I said. Itook notes after each session. Most therapists allow ten or fifteen minutes between patients, but I scheduled mine a half hour apart. That first year, I had a notebook in a different color for each. His was brown, and the pages for our first six sessions were almost empty. Talks about wife, what a good person she is. Annoying. The blankness I felt regarding this patient—I’ll call him K—may have been his most distinctive quality. My notes on other patients ran long. I found K boring. I didn’t particularly like him. And I liked having patients I liked. From Week 9: His wife (C) has an internal compass, whereas he’s not lying and grabbing and snatching because he’s afraid of being caught. How do you know? I asked. I noted that when he said “lyin’ and grabbin’ and snatchin’,” he said it in caricatured Ebonics. K visibly not black, I wrote. If pressed, what could I have said? That K was slender and nearly bald. That he was in his forties. He dressed in the style of our southern California community: good hard shoes but no jacket. Often he wore a gray, collared sweater, soft, close fitting. Probably cashmere. I wondered where he bought it. The shirts my husband chose faintly bothered me. For the past eight years, K had been counsel for a transpacific company. I knew this because I’d googled; he still didn’t talk about his work except once to tell me he’d have to cancel because he would be flying to Asia. K devoted our sessions to his wife and the minor problems of the rich. He’d bought a painting that was possibly a fake. He winced talking about his relationship with the dealer. I suggested that K cultivate dreams by keeping a notebook on the bedside table, but he claimed not to dream. He liked his wife to color her hair. Was that wrong of him? He asked me this and didn’t notice my hand going rogue to my head, where wiry white strands curled out from the dark. He decided to buy her a purse. He actually unfolded a picture to show me. See, it’s made to look like a plastic shopping bag from Chinatown. I loved that purse. I told my supervisor about K at our monthly training session. K had had a fight with his wife, who wanted the children to wash their own clothes. I’d said that everyone needs to learn how to do laundry. K had shrugged with a look of almost pleasurable guilt. I never did, he said. What about in college? Harvard has a laundry service, he said, flicking his wrist. I hated him a little then. I’d not gone to Harvard. And I still did laundry. Too much of it. In that gesture of K’s I saw what I feared a lot of people—my husband’s family, maybe even my patrician supervisor—really thought of me: that I was less because I had been poor. My supervisor was a very old, very tall man, a legend in the Los Angeles analytic community. He carried an aura of glamour, even then, in his eighties. I told him about the purse. I don’t think you’re less, he said. I admire you for having made your own way. A lot of the time K bored me, I admitted. My supervisor smiled, an expression of his never without a trace of pain. In the Seventies, he said, a village priest asked the great Dr.Winnicott how to differentiate between a parishioner who could benefit from talking and someone who needed professional help. Winnicott said, if he is boring you, then he is sick and needs psychiatric treatment. From the door, as I was leaving, I turned back to ask Dr. Bair, Where did you go to college? The Farm, he answered. Then, seeing my confusion, he explained. Stanford; we used to call it the farm. I don’t know if they still do. That same day, in the coffee shop near my office, I saw the purse. A young mother had hooked it over her stroller handle. I immediately searched for it online. Seventeen hundred dollars. Another spat with his wife. K wanted to visit Alaska. His descriptions of the wildlife were tender, reverential. He wanted to see the willow ptarmigan’s feathered feet. Snowy owls. Loons. The endangered Steller’s eider. In a decade, he said, so much will be gone. C said she planned to stay put. I suggested that that sounded cold. He defended her then, as if I’d attacked, which I suppose I had. She has more important responsibilities, he said, than swanning around the world with me. Let’s talk about our relationship, I said. Our relationship? K said. Yes. We’ve spent a good deal of time discussing your feelings about your wife. Let’s consider what’s going on right now in this room and whether or not that’s satisfying. This is a relationship we could end without damage. Our relationship, he said again. I hadn’t really thought of us as having one. I’m all right with you, he mumbled. Really? I said. Because I’m not sure I’ve been able to help you. Sometimes I feel we go over the same territory. Well, that’s probably my fault, he said. I haven’t talked about everything. But I suppose that’s what I’m here for. And then he told me. At the time I had a pencil in my hand, and I wrote down the date: January 28, 2012. I’m a pedophile, he said. The problem with my wife isn’t . . . I’ve never been enchanted with anyone her age. Which is to say my age. The light in my office made him look dangerously thin, pretzeled on the corduroy chair. (My furniture had finally arrived. K was the only one of my clients to notice.) I was aware of the narrowness of his shoulders in the gray, collared sweater, the niceness of his socks. All the hair on my arms stood up. There are questions I want to ask, I interrupted, but I need you to be aware, first, that in the state of California I will be required to report you if . . . Don’t worry, he said. I’ve never touched a child. I never will. That’s not why . . . he shrugged. Not a possibility. I have too much to lose. And, he paused, it’d be wrong. I get that. I have three kids. As he talked in an even voice I felt, for the first time, that we were in something together. Okay, I said, sitting back. I had a hundred questions. What age children? Girls or boys? When did this start? Were you abused? That’s what everybody’d probably think, right? But I don’t think so. There were strange things, but . . . He was not completely bald. He had a kind of hair I’d seen around LA the past few years. What time had left had been shaved to the length of a crew cut, but one absolutely distinguishable from the military forms of that style. All of a sudden his look entered the lexicon of handsome. I’m getting old, I thought. It seemed not only that I could fall in love with this person (in the way therapists fall in love, with the poignancy of renunciation) but that whatever that motion was, like a rope being shaken, it had already begun. We spent the next month hunting down a sexual predator in K’s past. I saw the population outside my office differently during that time. People in my coffee shop appeared heroic; I began to believe that many carried damage and made it their purpose not to pass that damage on. March 8 I quoted Auden in the brown notebook: I and the public knowWhat all schoolchildren learnThose to whom evil is doneDo evil in return. But not always, I scribbled.  We exhumed an inappropriate babysitter, a chubby fourteen-year-old with a contralto laugh who liked to lie over his lap and make him spank her, and a difficult mother (the opposite of C). But no real sexual evil. By the middle of the summer, we stopped trying. If it’s buried, it’s buried deep, he said. Why did you come to me when you did? I asked. I called you because of a girl, he said. He hadn’t in the least invited the situation. In fact, he avoided one-on-one time with his own daughters, he tended to take them places together, though he planned activities for himself with his son. I couldn’t imagine that kind of carefulness with my children. This girl, he said, followed him around at work for three weeks, as a project for school. And she fell for him, the eighth grader’s crush so obvious it became a joke in the office. Even her father, the CFO, laughed about it. For K, this felt excruciating. Because there was a current between them, and she was showing it while he had to act as if it didn’t exist. She asked him for a three-day-a-week internship. He said no. She slows me down, he told her father. I spend all my time explaining the law. The CFO was offended because K had insufficiently gushed. Isabel, her name was. Everyone else in the office loves Izzy, the CFO pointedly said. It was over now. He hadn’t seen her or heard about her for eight months. He had never once asked her father what she was doing, or whether she’d trekked through Orange County for the Christmas bird count. She’d talked about that. She kept a notebook with her sightings of local birds. She’d told him about a population of wild red-crowned parrots that had been growing since the Forties, when a flock escaped from a truck hurtling north from Mexico to a Bakersfield pet store. Now he read about birds whenever there was an article in the paper. He’d grown more attached to the family dog. So you had your love story, I said. I fell in love but in an impossible way. That’s what we call “wrong object.” Our hope is to keep those feelings and direct them to someone else. (I said that, but I didn’t know whether it was possible.) Right object, he said. Well we all know who that would be. I sometimes think I love my dog more than my wife. Ageneration ago, someone sat in a chair like mine and listened to a person talk about a different wrong object. In offices all over North America, psychiatrists attempted conversion therapies. My takeaway from those sad chapters of the history of psychology was that you could scare people and make them celibate, you could maybe stop them from doing what they had the urge to do, but it was nearly impossible to implant an alternate desire. The arc of gay liberation had a good ending, at least in California. But K’s problem never could. We’d already gone ten minutes over time and K was still talking when I told him we had to stop. He looked at me with gratitude as he stood. He seemed relieved. His secrecy was ending, but mine had just begun. Now I knew there was a real child. I wished he hadn’t told me her name. Shrinks promise confidentiality, but everyone breaks that promise. I talked to my husband about patients, and not only to him. I’d once puzzled out a couple’s case with my running partner. But I couldn’t tell anyone about K; I didn’t want to. I felt pretty sure no one would understand. I spent a few hours on the internet. The case law was iffy. Child pornography was illegal and could have arguably been subject to mandatory reporting. I hoped he wasn’t watching child porn. I slid into bed next to my sleeping husband. I may have been honor bound to tell my supervising analyst, but Dr.Bair was leaving for a nine-week writing retreat in Scotland, where he planned to devote himself to a memoir in verse about his first marriage, to a wife who died young. Over the next weeks, K told me about his first object. We talked in it and around it, the way music reorganizes itself. We added a second session, Thursday mornings. The summer he was thirteen K had fallen in love with a friend of his sister’s, a girl named Anna Li. His family had rented a house in Malibu, and he followed the two girls everywhere. The ends of her hair touched her hips. She had stick legs, dark compared with his own freckled skin. He was a geek then, he told me, with acne. I thought I would grow out of that and be one of those guys who had a beautiful younger wife, he said. His mother, in fact, was a beautiful wife, sixteen years younger than his father. The three children slept on a porch cantilevered over sand, and heard the thunder of rippling waves all night long. Anna Li’s wrist had brushed against his, but that was all until the day before he left (his parents had decided to return home early), when the three waded into the ocean and his sister ran back to get a popsicle from the refrigerator. He watched her trudging up the sand and thought her bum was too big. Anna tied her hair up in a knot by touch alone, her elbows out to the sides of her ears. He was standing but just barely, with ridged sand under his feet; the waves lifted him up and down; it was like jumping without gravity. Their bodies found each other and he felt her legs waving underwater, like sea fronds, then her knees touching both sides of him. She placed her hands on his shoulders, which were rising up and down, too. She kissed him, and the inside of her mouth tasted of melon, the musky flavor he hadn’t liked but now did. The smell of sea, the knob of her ankle on his back, her hands light on his shoulders, bobbing up and down with the surf. They laughed, looking at each other because they fit. Then, suddenly, a huge wave came and unlatched them, hurled them tumbling in foam, and when they emerged nine feet apart her face was covered with her netted hair, the rubber band lost to the sea. His mother, in a yellow blouse, stood waving from the deck; his sister was returning, her splayed feet sinking in the sand with each step. The sun puckered the surface of the ocean. Their eyes shone; their hair plastered against their skin. He left for New York with his family the next day and never saw her again. She runs a cosmetics company now, he said. But the age of the girls he loved did not march up the staircase with him. He’d desired a thirteen-year-old when he was thirteen, when he was in high school, then when he was in his twenties and thirties. The penchant never changed. He’d married at thirty-six. I asked if he’d thought of telling C then. He hadn’t. I mean how would you bring it up? By the way, I’m not really all that attracted to you? I thought that he could tell her now, but what if she ran out of the house with the children and hired a divorce lawyer? I  read about a Canadian psychiatrist who’d closed down his practice and sent former patients, on whom he’d attempted conversion therapy, letters of apology with refund checks. Eventually the doctor went bankrupt. My supervisor summoned me for one last meeting before he left for Scotland. He had a fire going in his office fireplace. I’d never known it worked. Gas, he said when I stared. He always offered me coffee during our sessions, and I accepted, though it was late afternoon. He wore a flannel shirt under his suit jacket and hiking boots, already dressed for his retreat. He efficiently ran through each of my patients. He asked me about K only once. What about the purse? I told him the truth: I’d forgotten it. He’s not boring you anymore? No, I said. I wished him well on his book, hoping I would see him again. At his age, I couldn’t be sure. And then it was just K and me. What does it mean to be a non-acting “minor-attracted person”? I asked, which is what he’d started to call himself. For some people, I suppose, it would mean they can’t have sex. Not real sex. But that’s not you, I said. You’re not celibate. Not exactly. With that qualifier, it seemed I’d bitten a tip of cardboard. If a guy in a bar says, My wife and I have great sex, and his buddy says, Meh, ours is so-so, what does that even tell you? Maybe the one’s so-so would have been the other’s nirvana. I asked about his fantasies. It’s pretty much always the same, he said. We’re in water. She’s skinny, teasing. She coaxes me. I have to be pulled into the game. No face usually. But a girl. That body. Do you think of this fantasy to become aroused with your wife? My running partner once told me she had to imagine being raped to come and the ickiness bothered her so much that orgasms didn’t seem worth the trouble. She’d read about arousal reconditioning in a women’s magazine. In the Sixties, psychologists had patients masturbate to a favorite fantasy and then replace that with something more acceptable just seconds before climax, when it was too late to stop. Gradually, they pulled the switch back, until finally, the idea went, the patient wouldn’t need the fantasy at all. But arousal reconditioning therapy failed—at least, it failed to make gay people straight. My running partner said she couldn’t completely obliterate the need for violence, but now she only required a minute or two. I’d also read about satiation training, which was kind of the opposite. Patients masturbated to their favorite fantasies over and over again until they wore them out. I’ll try number one, K said, now that we’re picking from discredited therapies. How many times a week do I have to do this? Two or three, I said. She’s gonna wonder what’s gotten into me. He had been having sex with his wife all along, but not a lot. Still, he said, not appreciably less than their friends. Unlike with those couples, though, K was the one who demurred. Sometimes during dinners out, the men made jokes about missing the sex-rich time before marriage, looking at their wives with blame. This humiliated his wife. But after two weeks of the regime and K’s apparently newfound appetite, they laughed together about their previous imbalance. At the end of five weeks, C called a moratorium. This is a little too much for me, she told him. Instead, she signed them up for a Ligurian cooking class. The chef would come to them. How had it worked? I don’t know, he said. Without the fantasy, her naked face was like an old friend. K had an unusually large mouth. His lips pressed together in an exaggerated tight smile, which he held a moment then let down. Oh, that’s a grimace, I realized. Sometimes I understood what a word meant from reading but had never met it in life. I asked again whether he could tell her. I thought it was worth the risk. But he didn’t want to. You’ve never asked me about porn, he said. I raised a hand, meaning Stop. My fantasy, he said, it was never that at all. He returned to his first concern: his marriage. Okay, so I don’t have the sparkle, he said, or whatever that is. But my question is still the same. Do I love her enough? The problem is choice. If you turn away from your instincts, you’re left with rationality, essentially with shopping. There is something repellent about deciding to pick a person that way. This one’s a wonderful cook. That one looks great dressed up. The other one’s fluent in three languages but disorganized. Isn’t that more or less what we all do? I said. Really? Well, few of us marry paraplegics. You married a paraplegic? He asked. No. I did the usual thing. Maybe we’re done, K said. The one thing we haven’t tried is telling your wife. He shook his head. This is enough for me. Why should she have to learn that she had her children with a monster? She could have married plenty of other guys. I’d written statistics on a three-by-five index card. But what could I say: You are not alone? After that the life went out of our sessions. He canceled frequently for trips, more family trips, I noted, fewer business. He no longer seemed miserable. By the summer, he’d stopped coming altogether. That might have been the happy end of our story. Dr. Bair eventually returned from Scotland, where he’d broken a leg, walking on a rocky crag. The footsteps, he said, helped his prosody. He’d had to spend the last six weeks of his retreat in a Swiss rehabilitation facility. This time no fire burned in the marble fireplace of his office. He offered coffee as usual, but I declined, in deference to the plastic boot on his leg. I summarized my cases, skipping lightly over K’s termination. I’m still not getting a clear sense of your work with him, he said. I always thought something would emerge from all that boredom. Maybe now that it was over, I could tell him more. I wanted to talk about K. None of my current patients engaged me as much. I looked at Dr. Bair’s long face, pale and weaker from his trip, and remembered him saying, I don’t think you’re less. I decided to trust him. I started to describe our work, what we’d accomplished, what we’d left unfinished. But his gaze focused. His eyebrows rose. I’m surprised at you, he said. He never touched a minor. He came to get help. According to his own report. Did he engage in pornography? I could have lied. Well, only once, I finally said. I tried to remember my statistics. There are something like four million child-porn websites. And he hated it. He didn’t do anything, I said, too loud. He came to me to learn how to live with these feelings. If something happened to him for seeking help that would be a really bad thing. I saw I’d made a mistake. I wanted to ask him to promise he wouldn’t report K, but instead I flattered him, asking how his work on the memoir had gone, whether he’d been able to finish. He shook his head and told me that he’d made some progress, but not as much as he’d hoped. A few weeks later, on a Tuesday evening, there was a knock on my office door. A woman introduced herself as Catherine. Someone had reported her husband, she told me. There had been an investigation. He hadn’t done anything, she said, and so of course he’d been cleared. I thought of explaining that it wasn’t me who’d reported him, but it was anyway, I supposed, my fault. K had obviously told her almost everything. What I’d hoped for had come true; she stood here his ally, her black hair pulled back in a ponytail. They were no doubt closer from their mutual rage. She was stately, truly beautiful with large Grecian features. She was not carrying the purse that looked like a plastic shopping bag but dressed with classical good taste: a knit suit, modest heels at the end of long slim calves. He’d never once told me that C was beautiful, her proportions probably wasted on him. I’m sure he hadn’t thought of me in those terms at all. I’m sorry, I said. I didn’t want this to happen. He feels terribly betrayed, she said. We both do. I left my office, taping a note on the door to cancel my later session, and I meandered on residential streets, walking in and out of pockets of sound, leaf blowers, illegal but still used everywhere here, and occasionally a choir of birds under an inexplicably hospitable tree. I’d started noticing birds. Without meaning to, K had given me the inclination. It may have been all K still had from the girl. I thought about Dr. Bair. I was just a beginner and he was an eminence. But our relationship wasn’t what I’d believed. At least Isabel, the girl, had been spared. No doubt by now she’d forgotten her crush. Perhaps she’d begun dating, in the way of our high schoolers, via texts and Instagram. I wondered if she’d kept her love of birds.

        "story": "Her bathroom was a wreck. This tiny, ruinous space. The contractor had tiled the walls askew and had to start over. He’d set the tub askew and had to start over. Nothing was level. He drove her nuts. And now this: a love letter. A love email full of emoticons and JPEGs of roses in bloom. Lady Joanna, it said. The more I see you, the more I want to see you. He’d sent the email ten minutes before he was scheduled to show up for the day’s work. Did he expect her to open the door naked? This was absurd. Single woman + contractor = absurd. She blushed so thoroughly the heat of it stormed her arms and legs and shot out her face like dragon breath. She emailed back immediately. Sternly, because she was often alone in the apartment with him and wanted to shut the door on his interest in lieu of a real door because the layout of her place was open and ostensibly conducive to intimacies she’d yet to experience there. When he arrived, he bowed his head and fired up the tile saw. By month five, he’d cracked the mirror on her vanity and had to custom-order a new one. I’m just trying to win your heart, he wrote—texted—from the bathroom while she toddled around the living room in sweatpants and a panda bear T-shirt. She once saw him shirtless, mopping his forehead with a wad of paper towels. His chest hair was coiled tight and white against the dark palette of his skin. She was so startled she left the apartment for several hours until she’d browsed every aisle of a discount store loaded with tchotchkes and gadgets purported to hack the mainframe of unhappiness into which she was thrust every day. The contractor’s name was Louie. A good man, she’d been told by the three people who’d recommended him. He was helping to rebuild an elementary school that had burned down, and doing this work for free after he left her place. He had a ten-year-old daughter he spoke about often and animatedly. He called her Pudding, which seemed gross only in the context of his hitting on Joanna. Otherwise, it seemed kind of sweet. Every day, he’d say the same thing: “The bathroom will be done next week.” And every morning he’d be back to make no progress. Some nights she crept in there with breath held, as if flouting the boundary of someone else’s privacy, and then felt chastened as a result. Except that the mess, the dust and debris—these were gauges of her unmet needs, which were easier to wallow in than repair. She started to visit the bathroom nightly. Some mornings Louie would ask about her favorite food. Others about what music she liked. He was trying to get to know her. “Pistachios,” she’d say, and return to her work. “Pineapple.” And then he’d show up with green muffins and fruit salad he’d made at home and leave these offerings on her counter without comment. Whenever she forgot he had feelings for her, she kind of liked him. Bathroom, by Alex Kanevsky © The artist. Courtesy Hollis Taggart Galleries, New York City On the first day of month seven, her phone rang while she was sitting on the lip of the tub, which had been propped on risers so that Louie could replace the drainpipe he’d nicked. She looked at the number and nearly didn’t answer. It was her father, though when she did answer, it was actually her mother saying her father had gotten pneumonia and was in the ER. And that it was serious. The bomb of this news landed with a thud somewhere between Joanna’s guilt for not being there—her father had been sick for the past few months—and her relief at not being there. She held the phone as if it were the detonator and she in control of whether it exploded or not. Her mother said this time could be it. Louie came back the next morning, this time with a Beatles record he’d picked up at a flea market. He pushed it her way and said, “Thought you might like it.” She’d once told him she loved the Beatles, though in truth she only tolerated them on oldies radio. She flipped the record over to look at the song list. She did not own a record player. Her flight left in a few hours. She said, “Look, the bathroom has to be done by the time I get back. I need this bathroom to get done.” “I know,” he said. “I’m trying.” “I’m serious. You have to get a move on.” “I know,” he said, and hung his head, and when she was on line at the airport, the text came in: Knowing you want to punch my lights out, all I can think is how I’d love to hold you close. Give me a chance? At airport security, Joanna opted out of the full-body scan. She always did. She thought the machines gave you cancer. She’d say, “Female assist, please,” and then be made to wait until a TSA officer marched her to a more secluded area and felt her up. Which wasn’t even the worst part. The worst part was that as the officer cruised her thighs and breasts with her gloves, Joanna would think, This is the most physical contact I’ve had in six months. Eight months. A year. She’d flinch at the touch just for its novelty and hope the officer didn’t misconstrue the why of it, though she knew this was asking a lot. “I’m using the back of my hands,” the officer said. “I’m feeling around your waistline.” Joanna deflated the instant the check was over. She retrieved her phone from her bag and thumbed in the news to Louie: This has to stop. The officer wished her a safe trip. Her parents had been married for fifty-two years. Her father had been faithful for all but one—the last one—which satisfied her mother’s long-standing dread of betrayal for being twelve years older. She’d waited a half century to feel old and unwanted, and because age had taken care of the first, the shock of the second was all the worse. “It’s bad,” she said when Joanna got to the hospital. “Chrissy’s already in there.” Chris was Joanna’s younger brother. “Dad’s tough,” Joanna said. “You’ll see.” Her mother shook her head. “You’re tough,” she said. “I’m tough. But your father? Go in.” “Mom, your makeup’s a mess,” she said, and tried to wipe the orange paste from her cheekbones. “Go in,” her mother said. “I used the wrong mirror today.” Joanna lingered at the door. She had always loved her father, though she’d never managed to know him well. He’d been more like a patron than a parent. Like a man who gives sandwiches to the poor: kind, decent, but still married to a life that had nothing to do with the few minutes he spent being kind to them. As a kid, she’d attempted to compel intimacy by watching all the big sporting events with him. The World Series. The Super Bowl. As a teenager, she’d demanded he share painful things about his own childhood—the loss of his mother, for instance—but when he cried in the telling, she hadn’t felt connected so much as scared at having no idea how to comfort her patron. At the time, she blamed him, but now and then, if she thought about it, which she didn’t, but when she did, she blamed herself. Nowadays, she spoke to her father every two weeks. She’d tell him about her work; he’d tell her about his Italian lessons and then pass the phone to her mother. She knocked on the door. Chris was standing over the bed, saying, “Daddy, you have to keep it on. I know it’s horrible, but you have to, okay?” Daddy. She hadn’t heard that word since they were kids. It was strange and infantilizing and nearly made her laugh, though the impulse was stymied by the sight of her father, whose face was strapped into a plastic mask that forced air into his lungs. It was like a catcher’s mask, pulled over the top and sides of his head so tightly the plastic had grooved new dents into his skin. He’d shed at least twenty pounds. And his eyes, which had always been large and wide set, seemed afloat in their sockets, at least until locking onto her own, which were aghast. “Daddy, stop,” Chris said, and pushed their father’s hands away from the mask. Joanna’s feet began to walk her back toward the door. “See that number?” Chris said to her. He held his finger to the monitor. “Eighty-five. Blood oxygen level. He’s gotta wear the mask. Any lower and we’re in trouble.” She watched Chris put on his jacket, and it was only when he zipped it up that she understood he intended to leave. “Mom needs a break,” he said. “I’m taking her to the cafeteria.” Chris had never left the neighborhood—lived just two blocks from their family home—and so he was the one who always had to shoulder their parents’ problems, Joanna living too far away to contribute. So of course she’d contribute now. But she was scared. “Sure thing,” Joanna said. “I got this.” Her father was saying something into the mask. She palmed his forehead, which was warm and soft, and said, “It’s going to be okay, Dad.” The machine read 84. He rolled his head from side to side. He’d always been so meticulous about his hair, slicking it back with a gel whose smell she had come to associate with him over the years. A little minty. Some lemon. Now she tried to tidy his hair, though he obviously did not care. “Are you in pain?” she said. If he was in pain, she could go find a nurse who could help. “Do you want to read the paper?” she said. He lifted his hand for a moment, then gave up. So this was her father in the hospital. She’d worried about her mother’s death for years but had never given much thought to her father’s, probably because he was the young one. Maybe, even, the dispensable one, which was okay to think, since he was never going to die anyway. “Dad, no!” she said, jumping to her feet. He was grabbing the straps of his mask again. She tried to stop him but he resisted, and she could not bring herself to wrestle with her incredibly sick father even though she understood that between him and recovery might well be the mask. Why couldn’t she do this one simple thing? “Please?” she said. “You have no idea,” he said once he’d managed to get it off. He rested the mask on his chest and covered it with his palm. Her phone buzzed. She ripped it from her pocket, praying it was Chris. Instead, a text from Louie: I see the beautiful person that you are, Joanna. I see you every day. She pressed the phone to her forehead. Her life was ridiculous without the benefit of this fact modulating its also being hard and sad and, at the moment, blown up with a parent she did not know how to help. She wrote, I’m at the hospital with my father. He might be dying. Please make progress today. His blood oxygen had dipped to 82. She hunched her shoulders and crouched behind a bulwark of hope that said, 82 isn’t so bad. Her father asked for water—his lips were dry—though she’d seen a sign taped to his door that said no liquids. She reached in her purse for some ChapStick but found none. His neck and shoulders hurt—knots—but she could not get to the right spots and couldn’t sit him up on her own. “Just help me,” he said, his anger pronouncing itself with an urgency that only made her feel all the more helpless. She rang for a nurse, who came in and said, “Mr. F-E-N-T-O-N.” “My father is not deaf,” Joanna said. “You need to wear the mask.” “It’s torture,” he said. “Good things often are,” the nurse said, and strapped it back to his face. She texted: What’s happening with the baseboards? I am so sorry about your father. I’m sending you good thoughts. The baseboards? Wrong size. I’ll get more tomorrow. You are unbelievable. You’re unbelievable. I’ve never met anyone like you. Just finish, okay? “Really with the phone?” Chris said. She put it away. They were eating Mexican food in a seating area outside the hospital cafeteria. “How do you find Dad?” her mom said. “He’ll get through this,” she said. “Of course,” Chris said. Their mother put her elbows on the table and leaned forward. “Do you know why he’s been taking Italian classes?” Joanna reached for her. She had mismatched the buttons on her shirt so that the collar rose up her neck on one side. “His girlfriend’s from Parma,” she said, and swatted Joanna’s hand away. “How do you even know that?” Joanna said, though it was clear from her brother’s expression that she was supposed to have changed the subject. “Because I know. He doodles in his lesson books like a schoolboy.” “Oh, Mom,” Joanna said. “This will pass. You’ll see.” “Why’s he so confused about everything?” Chris asked. “Low oxygen,” their mother said. Their father wanted to go home. He did not care if he suffocated on the way to the parking lot, he wanted out of there. But of course no one would let him leave. Chris said, “You can still get better, Daddy.” Joanna nodded. She’d been there for only a few hours, but already it seemed all over. One of his lungs had partially collapsed, but he had insisted no measures be taken to prolong his life under these circumstances. He wanted to live well or not live at all. The doctor came in to ask perfunctory questions about everyone’s well-being. “Tell him,” her father said. “I will. I’ll tell him later,” she said. “Tell him now.” The doctor was looking at her, which had her self-conscious to the point of feeling ashamed and finally just appalled. “My father is ready to die,” she said. “He wants you to do whatever you can to end what’s happening to him now.” Chris’s mouth fell open, less from the shock of their father’s wishes—he’d been repeating them for hours—than, presumably, from the spectacle of his sister saying them out loud. The doctor raised his voice, patted their father on the knee, and said, “Okay, Mr. Fenton. You just hang in there. I’ll be back tomorrow.” Their father looked incredulous, as if the doctor’s job were to end lives, not save them. Chris picked up the TV remote. “The game’s on,” he said. “Quarterfinals. Brazil, Colombia.” Joanna pulled her chair close to the bed. She’d actually been watching the World Cup obsessively this year. Rooting for Greece out of allegiance to the country whose economy was in the worst shape, but her interest had not waned now that they’d been eliminated. They watched the game. Periodically, she or Chris or the two of them together would ask their father if he’d consider wearing the mask, but he always said no. His numbers were up and they were down. He dozed, on and off. But mostly he asked to go home. By the time Brazil won, grief seemed to have settled on them like a fine dust. She wrote Louie: What is happening? How is your father? I’m here for you. Can you stop? Just be a professional. I can’t help how I feel. You can keep it to yourself. But I like it. What’s to like? Chris was by the window. “Do I need to confiscate that thing? Your priorities are remarkable.” Their father started weeping. Joanna took his hand and said, “Please don’t cry.” The crying had dipped his O2 numbers to 81. “Die?” he said. “Cry,” she said. “No one’s dying.” “How much time do I have left?” he said. “Daddy, I don’t know.” She couldn’t tell if he was lucid, but what did it matter? Just last week he’d told her, proudly, that he’d mastered the Italian conditional. Sarebbe così bello. It would be so nice. She asked Chris if they should give him a sedative. The doctors had said no, but Chris said he’d sneak him an Ambien later, though they could not know that in just an hour he’d be unable to breathe without the mask for even the ten seconds it would take to swallow a pill. And then this: “Knock, knock,” a woman said, standing at the door with a bouquet of flowers. “Is it okay?” Their father looked her way and smiled as if he’d never smiled before. “Ciao, tesoro,” he said in the loudest voice he’d mustered all day. “Come in,” and he reached his arms to her, which disrupted the action of his IVs and set off alarms, as if his health were being burgled right then. Joanna went a little pale. “Sei tutto per me,” he said, and the woman nodded and pressed her hands to her heart as if to say, Me, too. Then she pressed her lips to his one cheek and then the other. Joanna had seen her share of movies. She’d wept at the end of Cinema Paradiso. All that passion. The great loves. The feelings to which she’d never had access though God knows she’d dreamed about them all through her teens and twenties and thirties. The girlfriend was pretty. Dark hair, dark eyes. Chris sprang from his chair. “You can’t be here,” he said to the woman. “You need to leave.” He took her by the elbow and tried to push her out the door. Their father kept his arms outstretched. “But I want to see her,” he said, petulant and wounded, but not half as aggrieved as the look on his face, which seemed to communicate all his desolation and all the love he’d ever felt in his life. Joanna looked from him to the girlfriend, knowing their mother would be there any minute. She opened her mouth to say something. But by then, Chris was deporting the girlfriend with force. Joanna could hear her yelling all the way down the hall. And then it was quiet. And the words came. “Daddy, I’m sorry,” she said. But he just kept looking at the door, wide-eyed and waiting. “Daddy, please,” she said. “I am so incredibly sorry.” There was no funeral, just a viewing. The family stood around him in a semicircle, though no one approached the table. Joanna stared at his body. It did not seem to her that he was dead, except that she was in the kind of pain that storms your house and kicks everyone else out. She backed out of the room and waited in the car. Later, her mother cried because she’d lost her husband. And because her husband had betrayed her, which laced her grief with rage. She felt guilty about the rage now that he was gone, but also cheated because it was his fault her grief could not be pure. Joanna stayed with her in bed until she fell asleep. In the kitchen, she found Chris with his cheek pressed to the tabletop. “Did you tell Mom about the girlfriend?” she said. “Are you nuts?” “I can’t believe we did that,” she said. “What were we supposed to do?” “I don’t know. But was that the right thing? What we did do?” “We did it for Mom,” he said. “Right,” she said. “Right.” She texted Louie. I’ll be home tomorrow. What will I find? Someone waiting for you. You don’t give up, do you? Is it working? Nothing’s working. The bathroom was beautiful. The tiles were glass, mint-green. The floors were white. Everything was clean and gleaming. She’d dozed off and woke up on her bath mat. An alarm clock was going off in the apartment next door. It was still dark out. She sat up and leaned against the tub. The porcelain was cool against the back of her arms. The walls still smelled of paint. “Ciao, tesoro,” she said, and listened to the words roll off her tongue. “Sei tutto per me,” she said. You are everything to me. Two nights before, her mother had suggested that Joanna go to her father’s room and choose something—a keepsake—to take home. It did not take long to find his Italian lesson books and, in the back of one of them, in his careful scrawl, a list of a hundred ways to say “I love you” in Italian. Without you I am nothing. Day and night I dream only of you. I am drunk with you. Now she tore the page out of the workbook and taped it to the vanity mirror. She brushed her teeth. Brushed her hair. And stared at the page in place of where her face should have been. Louie had wanted to know how she liked the bathroom. She decided to tell him. She liked it very much. She wrote: Ask me more questions. She had answers to share. Her favorite food was carrot cake. Her favorite drink was lemonade. Paul over John, though what did it matter now that the Beatles were dead and gone. As for sports, she liked soccer the best because how often did you get to see people so in thrall to their joy?

        "story": "The few white boys in our town could ball. Breakaway layups, nothing-but-the-bottom-of-the-net free throws, buzzer-beater fadeaways. They slept with basketballs in their beds and told us about their dreams. We tried not to stare at the diamond studs in their ears as they talked about winning imaginary games in overtime or seeing blurry scoreboards. It don’t matter if I can see the score anyway, I finna play my hardest regardless, Brent Zalesky said once, squinting his eyes in the sunlight. Brent Zalesky lived in the Crest. He didn’t flinch at the sound of gunshots, he received detentions weekly, and he ganked tapes and CDs from Wherehouse with the clunky security devices still attached. Brent Zalesky knew how to get them off, armed only with pliers and a Bic lighter. This was 1996, and he never got caught. He took music requests and we’d find surprises in our lockers at school. We loved him for this. We loved his buzzed blond hair, his stainless–steel chain necklace, his jawline, his position. Brent Zalesky played point guard. All the boys on the team respected him. They called him Z. When the boys got their basketball photos from Lifetouch, we collected them like baseball cards and kept them in hole-punched plastic sleeves in our day planners. Each year, Z’s wallet-size basketball pic slid into the front of our collections. Freshman year, he simply signed his name on the back: Peace, Brent. Junior year, he wrote more words on the one he gave Marorie Balancio: Sup Rorie, I think you’re hella fine. Peace, Brent. Back then there were two movie theaters in town and he took her to the one that didn’t smell like Black & Milds and piss. Marorie said he drove up with a cigarette tucked behind his right ear, but he didn’t light it until after he dropped her off at home. She saw the small spark hanging outside his car window because he had waited until she unlocked the front door. Marorie couldn’t help but look back and wave before she walked inside. Earlier, during the movie, Brent Zalesky had fed her popcorn. She said it was like he knew exactly how much she needed and when she needed more in her mouth. We could only imagine what it felt like, to have his fingers so close to our open lips. Our parents said no boyfriends until we were thirty. They didn’t talk to our brothers like this because they wanted to bend down and kiss all their titis every day. Sons got brand-new Honda Preludes on their sixteenth birthdays. Our moms took wannabe directors to Circuit City and bought camcorders that ended up in corners collecting dust. Wannabe rock stars got Fender Stratocasters and we felt like those street performers in the city who stand on overturned milk crates and hope for quarters in an open guitar case. Still, we sang a cappella by our lockers on breaks. We wanted to be En Vogue, Xscape, TLC, SWV. Anytime Brent Zalesky walked by we got so weak in the knees we could hardly speak, you know? We wondered if we’d still know him when we turned eighteen, all of us desperate for him in our cotillions. Rosyl Manalo’s mom said throwing a cotillion would be a waste of money, but she also bought a big-ass Louis Vuitton hobo and filed a police report like it was a missing person when it got stolen from her shopping cart at the Canned Food Grocery Outlet. I had never seen her cry so hard before, Rosyl told us, not even when she thought someone kidnapped me at Service Merchandise. “The Altar,” by Robin Layton © The artist. From her book hoop: the american dream, published by powerHouse Books We weren’t worth much, not as much as sons. Sons never fucked up. Sons never had to pay rent. Marorie’s brother got a girl preggo when he was eighteen and they mooched off her parents for years. His babies are good luck, her mother said, excited about becoming a lola. But vacuuming at night was bad luck, cutting nails at night was bad luck, buying someone shoes was bad luck. If you give shoes as a gift, that person will walk out of your life forever. Moles, the color red, aquariums—all good luck. If something bad is going to happen to you in the house, the goldfish will absorb it. We’re not sure why we listened to women who pinched our noses in the kitchen when we were kids because we’d be so maganda if only our noses weren’t so flat and our skin wasn’t so dark. The complexion of the poor people who work in the province. We envied Lianni Benitez because her mother was dead. Still, it was ingrained in us all, to listen to our elders without question, to read their minds, to fetch things they pointed at with their chins. We barely knew our lolas and lolos, but every time we saw them, no matter how old we were, we reflexively reached out for the backs of their wrinkled hands to touch to our foreheads in greeting. Bless, bless, they would say. For all we know they could have been assholes when they were younger, but it didn’t matter. They had white hair now. We had to obey them, no questions asked. Jason Lagundi showed up in a limo to take Rosyl to prom, and then her mother grounded her. She wouldn’t have done that if it had been a white boy from Blackhawk, the kind who’d grow up to rock Brooks Brothers or Nantucket Reds from Murray’s Toggery Shop, the kind who never liked working or practice because he never had to, didn’t you know he was the kind who deserved everything? The kind who’d marry you only if you looked good on paper, the kind who apologized for sweating while he “made love” to you, the kind who wouldn’t still eat you out after getting his lip busted in a fight because, well, he’d never thrown a punch in his life. These boys lived across the Benicia–Martinez Bridge and then some, far enough away to look better, even though they sagged their pants and wore backward caps. They thought they could wear Vallejo, you know, like it was a high school phase. They’d wear it and take it off when it was time to grow up. When you grow up, you should be a doctor. Did you know your lolo was a doctor in thePhilippines? When you grow up, you should be a lawyer. You can make a lot of money and buy a big house. Did you know I had a big house in Quezon City? It was always about the house. Lianni Benitez lived in an apartment, and they talked about it like it was a shame. Anyone with a four-bedroom in Glen Cove was automatically a good person. They shook their heads when we told them where Brent Zalesky lived. He’s not going to go anywhere, our mothers said. Our lolas echoed them with, What, you think he’s going to grow up to be a professional player, like on the TV? We didn’t have an answer for that. What we knew was that Brent Zalesky played like it mattered. Real game or scrimmage, there was no difference. What we knew was that Brent Zalesky wasn’t afraid to fight for his team, for our school, for us. What we knew was that he liked reading about all kinds of professional athletes for inspiration. He would talk to us about real-life things in the hallway. Did you know Wayne Gretzky used to eat dinner with his skates on when he was a kid? Did you know Roberto Clemente used to stay late after practice and do one-hop throws into an overturned trash can at home plate over and over again, because it was the hardest throw to make from his position? To Brent Zalesky, there was never a point where great athletes stopped working at being great. No buzzers, no finish lines. They couldn’t rely on luck. They were always playing the game, working harder, trying to be better. We tried to relay this to our parents. To them, it didn’t matter that Brent Zalesky threw his heart out on the court for his teammates, night after night during the season. They couldn’t admire how he made fast decisions, how he’d casually throw up fingers to call a play as he dribbled past the half-court line, how teammates leaned closer to him during a time-out, how he lifted off the floor in the paint and floated in midair. It didn’t matter that he weaved and shot and fought for wins in a good-for-nothing gym in front of people like us. In the middle of junior year, Brent Zalesky started dating Marorie. We covered for her and never told her parents where she really was. After dinner one night, he pulled her into his bedroom by curling one finger around a belt loop on her jeans. There was more desire in that move than anything I’ve ever felt in my whole life, she still insists. He had one chick poster in his room, just one mixed in with his favorite athletes. Marorie was expecting to see a blonde (her mother had a pedestal for a co-worker named Virginia. My blond friend Virginia. . . Virginia and I did lunch today, did you know that she’s white?) but Jocelyn’s hair was dark, like ours, only highlighted in ways we weren’t allowed to think about. Some of us straight-up had mustaches, but our mothers never said anything, as if the longer we stayed furry, the longer they could keep the leashes on. Don’t wear lipstick, our mothers said, lipstick will make your lips turn brown and you don’t want them to be brown. This brown girl on the poster? She didn’t have a mustache. Who’s Jocelyn Enriquez, Marorie asked. You don’t know who this is? Marorie shook her head. She half expected him to talk about how Jocelyn Enriquez looked because that was the routine. When we wore flannel shirts from Choice, our mothers said we looked like farmers. When we stood up straight, they didn’t like that we looked taller than them. We were too skinny, too fat, our hair was too long, our hair was too short. Gain ten more pounds. They’d force-feed us bowls of mashed potatoes and butter and sigh when the scales never changed. Cut your hair. None of us were just right. And when we did crave arroz caldo from Goldilocks, our parents took us to Red Lobster or Olive Garden instead. Marorie was still looking at Jocelyn Enriquez when Brent Zalesky pulled a pair of headphones from underneath a pillow. He carefully placed them over Marorie’s ears, picked her up, and put her on the bed. These were the days of Walkmans, blank cassette tapes and running to the radio to push record. These were the days of working for what you wanted. No quick downloads, no Insta-anything. We asked her if they hooked up that night. No, she said, we just listened to Jocelyn Enriquez music.He was surprised I didn’t know who she was. That same spring, we started to find Jocelyn Enriquez tapes and CDs in our lockers at school. We knew they were from him. Then Candice Quijano discovered that Jocelyn graduated from Pinole Valley High School, just ten miles away from us, and we got hella excited when we learned Jocelyn was a member of the San Francisco Girls Chorus and had a recording contract by the time she was sixteen. Roberto Clemente was from Puerto Rico. Wayne Gretzky, Canada. And here was Jocelyn, who grew up so close to home. We listened to her voice in our bedrooms at night and turned the volume up a little when we heard a track in Tagalog. Our parents were ashamed of the language even though they spoke it. We used to joke that they didn’t teach us as kids because they didn’t want us to grow up to have accents like theirs. I don’t have an accent, English was the medium of instruction in the Philippines. But when we listened to that Jocelyn Enriquez song in Tagalog, it sounded beautiful. At the end of the chorus were the words mahal kita. We recognized this because of Brent Zalesky. He had written those two words at the bottom of a note in Marorie’s day planner. What does that mean? we asked her. It means I love you, she said. When we were in our beds that night, we thought about how strange it was, how we never heard our mothers and fathers say those words to us before, mahal kita. When Marorie tried out for varsity, we joined her even though our parents said it was dangerous. They didn’t want us doing anything outside of the house. We didn’t think we would be any safer staying inside and listening to our mothers criticize us. You’re going to get hurt, they warned us. We want to get hurt, we said. Brent Zalesky came to all of our home games. We played for him. At the free-throw line, we slid our palms on the bottoms of our sneakers before taking the basketball from the ref. Our palms got dirty quick, but it made the ball feel secure in our hands. We bent at the knees and learned how to hunger for that sound, those flicks at the bottom of the net. In practice after school we did suicides until we felt like puking. We did them in our driveways at night too. Somehow, in practice, we started to talk like the boys. When someone would miss a pass we’d say, Where were you at, playa? When someone shot an air ball, we’d put a fist to our mouths and boo like boys. It wasn’t long before we started to spit into our palms as we lined up to slap hands against opposing teams post-game. Good game, good game, good game, we’d all say. Sometimes we couldn’t hold in the laughs until the line was done. We blasted music in the gym during warm-ups before home games. Coach let us turn up the music so loud that we could feel the beat on the floor, could feel it in our bodies, our hearts. Who cared that the Bulls dominated back then and that the Dubs were shit. On the court, we felt proud. During games, we took hits and threw elbows like champs. Who cared about girls from Napa who put their fingers in our faces and timed their pregame team chant with ours so you couldn’t hear our voices? Who cared that we would grow up to have all kinds of girls interrupt us, correct us, cut us, talk over us, throw shrimp cocktail at us? Could we blame them? We were brown like their nannies, brown like the big-eyed dirty kids in those Save the Children commercials, brown like hotel housekeepers, brown like nurses who wiped asses, and brown like those Miss Universe runners-up who said things like, You know what, sir, in my twenty-two years of existence, I can say that there is nothing major major I mean problem that I’ve done in my life. . . because I’mvery confident with my family, with the love that they are giving to me. So thank you so muchthat I’m onstage. Thank you, thankyou so much! Fuck. We were brown like their daddies’ secretaries, brown like the women their daddies beat off to and sometimes left the family for, brown like me love you long time, brown like I need to apologize for offending you, brown like may I take your plate, brown like you think I need your charity, and brown like how can I help you, sir? Back then, we helped ourselves. We dove out of bounds. We broke bones. We didn’t care about sweat-slicked ponytails. Didn’t care about the skinned knees or bruises or scars, didn’t bother with bandages in the mornings before school. We got hard. All the marks on our faces and bodies said, So what, I’m still here.

        "story": "Mr. Hutchinson took his pipe out of his mouth. “Got a new dog, I see.” He was wearing his buff-colored work suit, which he wore every day because, he said, he had gotten used to wearing it on the production line. He had worked in a factory that made electrical equipment and rocket parts. Because he didn’t cinch the waist strap, the work suit gave him a columnar shape. His crew cut, meanwhile, made his head look square. “The police station in Lunenburg was giving away a litter,” Jacob replied. “What you gonna call him?” “Her. Butterscotch.” “Oh, is it a girl?” Mr. Hutchinson chuckled at his error, and both he and Jacob looked over at the pale, spindly five-month-old, which Jacob had just tied up in his family’s back yard. She was hurling herself toward them and then bouncing and flopping awkwardly as she was brought up short by her tether. “Your mother choose the name?” “My sister liked it, too.” Jacob hadn’t had an alternative to suggest, so he hadn’t much minded being outvoted. “Women like sweet things, don’t they.” Whenever Mr. Hutchinson puffed on his pipe, the rhythm of his breathing became methodical and a little hurried. “Well, everybody does, I suppose.” Mr. Hutchinson’s wife had died in the spring, and it was still easy for him to get teary-eyed. He had been married to her for fifty years. In the brief time the Putnams had known her, she had twice baked and shared with them layered cupcakes that she called napoleons: piecrust below, yellow Duncan Hines cake above, and a spoonful of raspberry jam in the middle. With chocolate frosting on top. Her funeral had been the last public event that the Putnams had attended as an intact family, and when her casket had been lowered into the ground, it had shocked Jacob to realize that the body was going to be left behind when all the living people went home. He had pictured it raining and the rain seeping down, and he had cried bitterly, even though he had scarcely known her. “You going to leave her out, in the winter?” Mr. Hutchinson asked. “I don’t know.” “I could help you build a house for her. They stay warm in the house, from their own heat, if it’s small enough.” He said the word “warm” with the r softened away. Waum. Jacob still heard the New England accent because he had been fairly old when the Putnams had moved to the state. “I don’t think I’d be able to build anything like that,” Jacob said. “I’ve got wood in the shop and some tar paper and some tin for the edging. Of course, you ask your mother first.” It would be a bore, Jacob thought, but he knew money was tight now, and Mr. Hutchinson was probably right that it would keep the puppy warm and dry. “It’s very kind of you.” “You ask your mother.” Jacob ran up the street to catch the school bus. When the Putnams had moved in, Mr. Hutchinson had boasted to them that he had bought his house so long ago that it had been sold to him by the builder of both theirs and his. The houses were almost mirror images of each other, though his was slate blue whereas the Putnams’ was Army green, and his was a little grander: it had four bedrooms on the second floor instead of three, it sat astraddle two lots rather than in the center of a single one, and its clapboards were wood instead of aluminum. He and his wife had sat out the fad for artificial siding that ran through the neighborhood a decade previously. Although Mrs. Hutchinson, while she had been alive, had never ventured beyond the blue shade of her screened-in porch, Mr. Hutchinson could be found in his driveway in all weathers, morning, noon, and night, smoking his pipe. If there was even a dusting of snow, he rose early and plowed the driveway with a gas-powered snowblower. He always plowed the Putnams’ driveway too, unasked and undiscourageably, as well as a subsidiary loop of asphalt that connected the two lanes and made it easier for both families to turn their cars around. On the first dry Saturday in May, he had resealed the blacktop on this loop when he resealed it on his own driveway, a standard of upkeep that the Putnams, even before Jacob’s mother and father split, had known they would never rise to. The asphalt of their driveway was already fissured and rumpled; the older couple that they had bought their house from must also have been lackadaisical. At the head of Mr. Hutchinson’s driveway was his barn, painted the same slate blue as his house. Half was a garage, large enough to hold two cars, though he owned only one. The other half housed a woodshop. When the Putnams first moved in, Mr. Hutchinson had given Jacob and his father a tour of it. Arrayed on its walls, hanging from hooks that were set into a reticulation of holes, were chisels, punches, gouges, knives, files, rasps, planes, clamps, vises, hammers, mallets, Tsquares, levels, saws, wire cutters, shears, and scissors. The orderliness and number of the instruments had made the revelation of them seem like the opening of a clock. Pasted up on a strip of wall beside an interior door was a collage of bare-breasted women, squatting and leaning and stretching—photos that had been scissored out of magazines and calendars. Jacob had sensed that it would be disrespectful to study the figures too closely, so he hadn’t. Disrespectful to the women, disrespectful to the part of Mr. Hutchinson that had been disclosed by his decision to paste them up. In the middle of the wall of tools was a telephone. “She knows better than to come out here,” Mr. Hutchinson had explained. “I tell her, this is my house and that’s hers.” (Huzz.) “But she knows she can always call if she needs me.” Mr. Hutchinson said that for a long time he had been taking in bureaus, tables, and chairs that were in need of restoration, from people who didn’t mind not knowing how long a repair might take him. “The things people do to furniture,” he said. He had recently decided to close his repair business. He had never needed the money. He did enjoy the work; the trouble was that he was almost too fond of it. “I work on a thing so long that I get so I don’t seem to want to finish with it,” he said, laughing at his softness. At the foot of his driveway, in the strip of grass that separated his property from the Putnams’, was a young magnolia. Either its showiness or the litter made by the thick white clamshells of its petals seemed to embarrass him, and while Mrs. Hutchinson had still been alive, he had always explained to anyone who remarked on the tree that he had planted it only at her request. “It makes an awful mess.” After she was gone, what he said was that he didn’t think he could bring himself to take it out, but he didn’t much care to look at it anymore. Mr. Hutchinson’s yard, most of which lay on the far side of his house, wasn’t like other yards on the street. It was larger, for one thing, on account of the double lot, and it was comparatively unchanging. The Hutchinsons’ children had long ago grown up and moved away, and the yard shared with the house an empty, slightly haunted look. Its ground had never been leveled or terraced. Large, bold, deep-rooted rocks surfaced in elliptical, organic shapes, at the edges of which Mr. Hutchinson had here and there left erect a stand of white birches. It was picturesque, in other words, in a way that was uncanny in a suburb. Jacob couldn’t tell whether the almost painterliness of it represented an intention on Mr.Hutchinson’s part or was merely the result of frugality. “I don’t know if I want Jacob exposed to that,” Mrs. Putnam said to her ex-husband.  “It’s probably fairly harmless, Irene.” “You told me he didn’t want his wife to see it.” “That’s not exactly what he said. I think it’s just a way of making the place his. His realm. It’s a working-class thing, isn’t it?” “I don’t want Jacob to get the idea that that sort of thing is all right,” she said. “That sort of thing isn’t all right,” Mr. Putnam said to Jacob. “Okay,” Jacob replied. Mrs. Putnam sighed. “I think it would be kind of cool to learn how to build a doghouse,” Mr. Putnam said reflectively. When the soul in one body recognizes the soul in another, Jacob wrote in his journal, which had flowers on the cover because he hadn’t realized until he brought it home from the bookstore how flowers would look, that is how you know whom you are meant for. Souls who have recognized each other must never leave each other. And therefore when two souls who think they recognize each other suddenly no longer feel that they really do, it is still their duty to try, because what if the not recognizing is the mistake? But I guess if in the end two people are really sure that they are not each other’s souls really, and they are sure now that they were never in fact together in the other world, the one that came before this one, then I guess there is nothing to be done and they must go their separate ways alone. “Jacob, set the table!” Mrs. Putnam yelled up the stairs. “Alice, wash your hands!” He had left out the problem of the inclination that one body could feel for another without any reference to soul. “We ought to start with a drawing,” Mr. Hutchinson said as soon as Jacob walked into the garage. Drawring. He had stored his empty pipe, tucking the stem of it into one of the narrow pockets in his work suit that had been sewn for a pen or pencil. “We did those in school last year,” Jacob said. Mechanical drawings were always on lime-green paper; everything depicted in them was rectilinear and in perspective. “Well, but I’m going to do this in my head, this one time. It’s basically a box, see? So once we set the dimensions of the base, and decide how much higher the front will be than the rear, the rest follows.” Jacob didn’t nod because he didn’t quite understand. “Of course she’s still growing,” Mr.Hutchinson continued, “but I think I see the size of dog she’ll be.” “How will she know to go inside?” “You put a blanket of hers in there, she’ll go in, when it’s cold enough. They like a small space, you know. They feel more secure.” Butterscotch in fact liked to hide under Jacob’s bed. “Got to be big enough for her to turn around inside, but not too much bigger,” Mr. Hutchinson said. Leaning against a wall of the garage were sheets of plywood and a few other pieces of lumber. Mr.Hutchinson slid out one of the sheets, and Jacob hurried to pick up the other end and then he walked backward while Mr. Hutchinson walked forward. The sheet of wood was marked by a red stamp in the shape of an almond or an eye, which reminded Jacob of the purple stamp he sometimes saw on cuts of meat in the butcher’s department of the grocery store. The stamp and what it was stamped on were cut up in tandem in both cases. “Did you buy this?” Jacob asked. “A long time ago,” Mr. Hutchinson replied. He pointed to strips of white-painted wood, square in cross section, that might have originally been the crossbars of a length of fence. “That’s salvage, there. That’s what we’ll use for the frame.” “Oh,” Jacob said, not understanding. “Can’t join up plywood tongue and groove.” It was a point of pride with Jacob that he usually understood immediately when a thing was explained to him, but this wasn’t his world. “The base and the two sides will be the same length, of course, and since we want the roof”—Mr.Hutchinson pronounced it like the child’s word for a dog’s bark—“to have a slant, we can cut the two sides from the same piece of wood, with a diagonal.” “I don’t understand,” Jacob admitted. In silence, Mr. Hutchinson opened a drawer and took out a pad of paper. He folded a piece of it in three, like a letter before it goes into an envelope, and let it hang open in his palm. It had the shape of a gutter. “Base and two sides the same length,” he said, pointing at the paper gutter. “I see,” Jacob said. Mr. Hutchinson now folded down at an angle the top edges of the two sides of the gutter, as if turning them into the wings of a paper airplane. He then tore the two sides of this paper gutter neatly off its base, and then flipped one side over to show that, thanks to the angles creased into their tops, the two sides could come together, like puzzle pieces, into a rectangle that was split along a diagonal. “I see,” Jacob said again. “This way, you see, we only need to cut the length of these three pieces once.” Jacob still wasn’t going to take up woodworking for the same reason that he wasn’t going to accept custody of any of Mr. Hutchinson’s sorrow. There already wasn’t room in his life for anything that wasn’t irrevocably his. After about an hour of work, he and Mr. Hutchinson put away their tools and stored the pieces of wood that they had measured and cut. At the beginning of the hour, Jacob had taken a few nervous glances at the collage. It had unsettled him that the figures were straining so hard to be pleasing. It wasn’t that he approved or disapproved, necessarily. The strain in the women’s eyes had happened a long time ago, he told himself. He wasn’t responsible. What he didn’t understand was why Mr. Hutchinson or anyone else would find such pictures appealing. The best he could do was think of the collage as a piece of archaic art, and the grimaces and stereotyped postures as representational conventions, the motives for which had been lost with the passage of time. The next afternoon, Mr.Hutchinson rapped on the Putnams’ storm door, which was askew in its frame and rattled. “Is your mother home?” he asked when Jacob and Alice came into the kitchen to look at him. He was holding a cake. Their mother came downstairs. “Did you make this?” “Oh, it’s just a little thing.” It was a tall, single-tier cake with a smooth amber crust, with a hole in the middle of it like in a millstone. Mr. Hutchinson was carrying it on a dented brass cake stand, which he held by its spindle. A thin pink sugar glaze had been dripped over the top. “Do you like angel food?” he asked. “We always liked it, but not everyone does.” “Angel food,” Jacob’s mother repeated. She took it from him and set it on the kitchen table. “Can I cut you a piece, Mr. Hutchinson?” “Oh, no,” he said. “But you go ahead. You and the kids.” “It might be too sweet for me, with the icing,” Mrs. Putnam commented. “I should have made it without icing.” “I didn’t mean that, Mr. Hutchinson.” “I would tell you to call me Maurice, but nobody ever does. What they call me is Sonny.” The cake was strangely thick, like cotton candy, and had a similar spongelike texture. When pressed with a fork, it remembered the shape it had been and tried to return to it. “It’s good,” Mrs. Putnam said, after a bite. The children chorused more enthusiastically and soon finished their pieces. “Well, it’s from a mix, I’m afraid. I’m not the cook Virginia was, but I think it’s nice to have a treat from time to time, especially if you don’t expect it. I worry about you, you know, with your job, and what with the kids here.” “You don’t have to do that.” “Well, if you ever need anything.” “I so appreciate it that you’re making that doghouse with Jacob.” “We did good work on it yesterday,” Mr. Hutchinson said. Mrs. Putnam patted her son on the arm. “I remember when I started at the factory, I was only a little older than he is now. I thought, this might not be a bad job for a year or two. Beats farming, anyway. But when you start a thing like that you keep going at it, and one day I looked around and there I was, the oldest man on the floor. Now, how did that happen. And the next thing I knew after that, they’re giving me a watch for forty-five years of service. For your whole life, for forty-five years of service, a watch.” He looked to Mrs. Putnam for a reaction. Did he have tears in his eyes again? It was a speech he had delivered before, and Jacob wondered whether it would be impolite for his mother to answer the same way she had on previous occasions. “It’s a pity,” she finally said. “Oh, I did pretty well out of it, I suppose.” That year, under a special dispensation, Jacob walked to the high school in the mornings for a geometry class before he reported to the middle school. Two years older, the other students in the class paid little attention to him, but when they did they were old enough to be willing to be kind to someone they must have seen as a child and something of a misfit. In their company Jacob felt sometimes that he was never going to grow up the way others did and that he was never going to be mastered by his body the way they were, but also that he was never going to come into mastery of it. Usually when the class was slow to understand a proof, he flipped through the textbook and worked out in his head the answer to a problem in a later chapter. But one day Kenny Simonelli, who sat in the next aisle, one seat ahead, was wearing a T-shirt whose sleeves were cut so high that one could see locks of dark hair that shot out from his armpits. He wasn’t the kind of boy who knew to be ashamed of his body, and the soft hair was a sign of his vigor, like the grass that shoots up from between squares of concrete in a sidewalk. Jacob told himself that the reason he couldn’t stop looking was because the sight was so ugly. “I think he thinks he’s courting me, Joe,” Mrs. Putnam said to her ex-husband one Sunday afternoon, when he was dropping Jacob and Alice off after a weekend at his furnitureless divorce apartment in the city. “He’s older than our parents.” “Was it a good cake, at least?” “Joe, please.” “I liked it,” Jacob volunteered. “You’re in eighth grade,” his mother replied. It must be that after a body dies the soul forgets everything it learned in the world before returning to a body again. So, what is the world for, if everything you learn here is erased? And how does a soul recognize its companion, the soul it knew before, if every cycle it forgets everything? There must be two kinds of memory, of the body and of the soul. And only the memory of the body is erased. There must be a soul-memory that is forever but isn’t of anything in particular. Like math? Jacob didn’t wear his glasses when he wrote because he didn’t need them for that, and when he looked up from his journal and out the window he was semi-blind and the still-green top arms of the oak trees across the street were out of focus, bowing and dancing in a gray wind that threatened rain, waving, ducking, flailing, rising, as if the hundreds of leaves on the branches were being presented to him in their motion together as something conjoint but articulated, as if the hundreds of leaves were acting ensemble as a marionette or a shadow puppet, each leaf held up on and moving on a stick of its own, the wind the puppeteer. The dance, Jacob realized, was more discernible to him because he couldn’t see the individuality of the leaves and couldn’t see the stems they were attached to. The dancing ensembles whipped to one side; recoiled; bent backward; relaxed. It was the indistinction of Jacob’s vision that made it possible for him to see the rhythm. When Jacob didn’t understand why, say, the front panel of the doghouse should be one width of plywood shorter than the front edges of the two side panels, Mr. Hutchinson was able to show him with only a few hand gestures. Teaching had probably been part of his job on the production line. But Jacob appreciated Mr.Hutchinson’s patience and straightforwardness only impartially, the way one admires the neat plumage of a bird that one wasn’t looking for but that happens to have perched in a tree nearby. Out of the recycled fence beams, he and Mr. Hutchinson built two square frames, one to buttress the front panel and one to buttress the back. Then, with a jigsaw, they were going to cut a hole in the front panel for Butterscotch to go in and out of. “Shouldn’t be too much broader than her head and shoulders are going to be,” Mr. Hutchinson said as he marked out a rectangle in pencil. “Should we make it a little bigger just to be on the safe side?” “Don’t want to let the heat out. Say, does your mother like the pictures?” Jacob almost turned to look at the collage but at the last moment he understood. “You mean the movies. Yes.” “How about your sister? She too little?” “She goes to the movies.” “I think I’m going to ask your mother if I can take her and the two of you.” “There’s a new one about UFOs,” Jacob said. “Is there? I saw that one they had about zombies. Didn’t much care for it.” “No, this is about how the aliens might not necessarily be bad.” “Oh, is it?” Mr. Hutchinson extracted his pipe from its pocket and tamped his stubby thumb nervously down into the bowl. It was a tic that usually meant he was going to suggest in a minute or two that they down tools. “The things they think of.” “Richard Dreyfuss is in it. He was in Jaws, but I wasn’t allowed to see that.” “That the one with the shark?” Shahk. Mr. Hutchinson laughed but looked a little concerned. “What was the movie about zombies?” Jacob asked. “Don’t remember what it was called. Now, when did I see that?” Mr. Hutchinson bit on his empty pipe and looked out the open door to a corner of visible sky. “Do you know, I think it’s been twenty years since I’ve been to the pictures.” Jacob had therefore seen a movie more recently than Mr. Hutchinson simply by virtue of having seen any movie at all since he had been born. “Apparently Jacob just told him yes,” Mrs. Putnam said to her ex-husband.  “I wasn’t thinking about it like that,” Jacob protested. “Maybe you could come, too, Joe. As the children’s father.” “I don’t want to cut in,” Mr. Putnam said. “Oh, it isn’t funny, really. I feel so bad. He’s out there all day long. Whenever I go outside, whenever I look out the window. With his pipe.” “Do you want me to say something to him?” Mr. Putnam asked. “No. God no.” When Mr. Hutchinson rapped on the kitchen door, he stood at a tangent to it, because he was too polite to look into its window before it was opened. Jacob saw that he was wearing a faded black tuxedo and carrying a derby. “Mom, are you ready?” Jacob hollered up the stairs. He opened the door for Mr. Hutchinson. “Is your mother in?” “She’ll be down in a second. Come on in.” “Oh, I’ll wait.” Alice came downstairs first. She was too young to know to disguise her stare. “Aren’t we just going to the movies?” she asked. “Yes, we’re going to the movies,” Jacob told her curtly. “Come on in,” Mrs. Putnam said, when she appeared. “Don’t you look nice,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “Not as nice as you,” Mrs. Putnam replied, her head turned to one side as she finished screwing in her earrings. Except for the addition of the earrings, she was only wearing what she had put on that morning. “Heh,” said Mr. Hutchinson. He glanced at Jacob, who had on corduroys and a plaid shirt. “Now tell me, Irene, is this the new theater down on Clement, past the bowling alley?” “Don’t worry, I’m going to drive.” She had told Jacob she didn’t think it was safe for them to be Mr. Hutchinson’s passengers. “I’ve got my car all pulled around.” “Oh, you’re so sweet, but I only feel comfortable in my own car. You just take it easy.” Mr. Hutchinson held the kitchen door open for Mrs. Putnam and the children. Mrs. Putnam waited on the porch until he came out himself so that she could lock it after him, and then because he seemed to be waiting for something on the top step she walked down ahead of him. His stately car, with its jagged fins and diamond taillights, was parked diagonally on the loop. “Shall I move it into the garage, so it’ll be out of your way?” he asked. “We’re already late,” Jacob’s mother said. “I can just back up.” The Putnams owned a Toyota hatchback. “Alice and I should get in first,” Jacob explained, flipping forward the bucket seat for the front passenger so that he and Alice could crawl in behind it. Once he had flopped the seat back toward himself, he told Mr. Hutchinson, “You can get in now.” The old man dipped one foot into the car gingerly, and as he ducked his head, his hat was knocked off, but he caught it. The limp black ribbon of his tie was knotted but not in a bow, Jacob noticed. Against the toylike plastic of the car’s interior, which Mr. Hutchinson sat in like an egg in a Styrofoam carton, he looked as if he had been abducted from his own time and place. His tuxedo gave off the faint chemical smell of mothballs. “Is everybody buckled in?” Mrs.Putnam asked. “Oh, I don’t usually bother,” Mr.Hutchinson replied. After a moment of deliberation, Mrs. Putnam started the engine. The car beeped at the unbuckled seat belt admonishingly. “It has a mind of its own,” Mr.Hutchinson commented, and they waited while he fished out the buckle and strap and figured out how to snap himself in. “Don’t be difficult,” Mrs. Putnam told Mr. Hutchinson at the ticket window.  “Then you better let me buy the popcorn.” The Putnams didn’t usually buy popcorn, but once they were in line for refreshments, Alice announced that she would have a large. “Will you be able to eat all that?” Mrs. Putnam asked. “Why don’t I split it with you.” “I’ll have a medium,” Jacob said. “Go ahead and get one for yourself, Irene,” Mr. Hutchinson encouraged. “Yeah, Mom,” Alice said. She agreed to a small. The glossy black and chrome of the refreshment stand must have been new to Mr. Hutchinson. The brightly colored circles and zigzags in the carpeting must have been new as well. A teenager in line with them backed into Mr. Hutchinson while she was laughing at something her date had said. “Almost looks like folks don’t wear their nice duds to the pictures anymore,” Mr. Hutchinson observed, once they had their popcorn and were heading into the theater. “I bet you and Mrs. Hutchinson always used to dress up nice when you went out,” Mrs. Putnam said. “We didn’t go out too often,” he said, and then he went stone-faced, as if he were privately reviewing those years. In the theater the two adults sat with the children between them, and toward the end of the movie, when Jacob remembered to check how Mr. Hutchinson was holding up, he saw that behind the old man’s glasses, on the lenses of which the movie was mirrored, he had closed his eyes. Saw Close Encounters of the Third Kind last night. Why does everyone assume alien life will be carbon-based? There are so many other elements in the periodic table. Another life-form might not even be recognizable to us. Still, interesting movie. It raises the possibility that there are souls on planets other than our own, which seems likely to me. If a soul were put into a very different kind of body, or if it were put into a body in a very different kind of way, would it still have the feeling of not quite fitting into it? Of not quite lining up with it? Probably that feeling is how you know that a soul and a body are not the same thing. “This is where even if you have a drawing you probably don’t want to use it,” Mr. Hutchinson said. They had assembled the crib of the doghouse, and they had cut the piece of plywood that was going to serve as its removable roof, and they had faced both crib and roof with tar paper and edged them with strips of tin. Now the roof was lying upside down on the worktable, and the crib was lying upside down on top of it, projecting at an angle thanks to the slant that they had cut in the sides so that when upright the roof would shunt off rain. The only thing left to do was cut four lengths of fence beam and nail them to the exposed underside of the roof, to form a square lip that would hold the roof in place. “By the end, you can usually use the thing itself as its own drawing.” Jacob held a length of fence beam along the front of the doghouse, and Mr. Hutchinson marked with pencil where they would cut it. “Shouldn’t it go all the way across?” Jacob asked. “Doesn’t need to, to hold it.” On the same fence beam they also marked the lengths of the doghouse’s two sides, but they had to start a new fence beam for the length that would go along the back. While operating the saw, Jacob wore Mr. Hutchinson’s rough gloves and large yellow goggles, which folded all the way around his face, over his own pair of glasses. The goggles reminded Jacob of a toy he had owned as a child, which you held up to your eyes in order to look at the world through a red pane or a yellow pane or a blue pane, or in combinations of the panes through green, orange, or purple. “Did you like the movie?” Jacob asked, just at the moment when, with the pedal, he was setting the saw into motion. Mr. Hutchinson didn’t hear him. Jacob slid the beam sideways into the blade, so that the rotor’s teeth bit in where Mr. Hutchinson had nicked the wood with his pencil. “Did you like the movie?” Jacob asked again, once the saw’s whine had sunk back into silence. “An awful lot of shouting, wasn’t there.” “They didn’t know what was going on,” Jacob explained. “That could be. Two more cuts.” He pointed to the remainder of beam in Jacob’s hands and to the pedal at Jacob’s feet. When the four lengths were cut, Mr. Hutchinson laid them on the eaves of the upside-down roof, snug against the outer edges of the upside-down crib. Jacob outlined the four lengths in pencil like bodies in the street after a murder spree, and then together he and Mr. Hutchinson lifted the base of the doghouse out of the way. “Now we just nail them down?” Jacob asked. “This way you’ll be able to just lift the top off when you want to clean it.” “Why would we need to clean it?” “Well, if she messes with a skunk, for example.” While Jacob hammered, Mr. Hutchinson handed nails to him, interrupting only when it looked like Jacob was going to space them too closely. Because Jacob had been getting so much practice, he hit almost all the nails true. When the roof was done they fitted it over the crib of the doghouse. “There,” Jacob said. “I think Butterscotch will like it.” “There it is,” Mr. Hutchinson agreed. Alice had said that it was going to look like a coffin, but it looked more like a birdhouse for a very large bird. The aperture in the front had darkened when they fitted the roof on, but maybe Butterscotch wouldn’t mind or would even welcome the protection of the shadow. They bent their knees and carried the house out of the barn and across the loop connecting the driveways and down into the Putnams’ back yard. Butterscotch pranced up on her hind legs once she let herself believe that they were actually headed her way. A few yellow maple leaves were tucked into the lawn endwise like bookmarks. The hips on the rosebush were already red. When they set the house down, Butterscotch sniffed it only briefly before wriggling her snout into their hands. “I’ll cut you two more lengths of wood for the house to sit on, crosswise,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “Won’t stop the damp-rot from getting into the wood but might slow it down.” It hadn’t occurred to Jacob that contact with soil could harm wood. It made sense to him that air would give some protection. Mr. Hutchinson scratched the ruff of the dog’s neck. “Does your mother ever make butterscotch for you?” “Like, the food?” Jacob asked. “She tried once, but it burned.” “When I was a boy my mother used to make it with butter from goats’ milk.” “Goats?” “My father got an idea one year, and he brought home goats.” Mr.Hutchinson felt for his pipe and his pouch of tobacco, and without looking began to assemble a smoke. “They eat anything, you know. Mother was so mad. But he’d already paid for them. The first time she made us drink the milk, we held our noses. It’s not for everyone. It’s almost too rich. But you get used to a thing, and once you’ve had goat’s milk, if you go back to cow’s, well, it just tastes like water. Like dishwater.” He tilted his head when he sucked, and Jacob watched the flame of his lighter step down into the bowl of the pipe. The crinkled edges of the small leaves in the bowl glowed orange. How much stronger and sweeter Mr. Hutchinson seemed to think the flavor of the world had once been.

        "story": "After Bonin liberated the Scots’ pelts, we rode the lower trail until we come to a ford in the river where the Frenchman run his ferry. But the barge was tied the other side and we saw no sign of that old trapper Plante. No dust rose behind us on the Mullan trail. Maybe we had not been followed. Liberate is a poorly word for what you done, I said to Bonin. We’d struck camp that morning for the north when Bonin rode up with that thick pelt pack tied to the cantle of his saddle. He said the Scots made him a bargain, that if we made a rush of it we could cross at Plante’s Ferry and sell the pelts at Fort Colville by nightfall. But the way he kept looking back I became of mind that Bonin had stole the pelts. So I asked him outright. That’s when he come up with that word liberated. A God-fearing man would’ve rode off then and let him take his own lashings, but my weakness and Bonin’s knowledge of that strange country had hold of my nerve. And now Plante’s Ferry was unmanned and our planning lay in waste. We could swim the ponies, I said. But Bonin’s pocked cheeks colored as he looked down that raging river. Snow still shadowed the foothills and the river bulged with fierce current. Might swamp the furs, he said. But I knew Bonin could not swim more than a thrash or two. And that early in spring the Spokan River was a beast. The plume would sop them pelts, pull his little Kentucky saddler downstream, and dump him in the froth. Just then a boy appeared from the brush on the other shore, a hundred feet across. He was small, nine or ten, from that river band of Indians that Plante had took up with. Where’s the Frenchman? Bonin called. I will cross you, the dark-skinned boy called back. Do it then, Bonin yelled. This being the only crossing, the posted price was high: four dollars for a wagon and six bits for each animal and man. We had no wagon, just two men and two animals and that bundle of pelts. The boy untied the log barge and began working his way across, using a long pole to push off the shore and along the riverbed. Two thick ropes rose from each end of the boat to pulleys hung on a high guide rope that spanned the river and was tied to thick trees on both shores. Near the middle of the river, the current pulled at the barge, the trees groaned, and the guide rope bent like a hunter pulling a bow. Onshore, Bonin gave his skittish pony’s bit a yank and said, Hush now. And then, in agreement with his horse, he said, I wish that boy would hurry. We both looked back at the trail behind us. Finally, the boy settled the barge on the bank and we walked our uncertain ponies onto the wood deck, shoes clomping. Bonin gave the boy six bits for himself and his animal. He looked at me. You are the cause of this, I said. So he dug out more money. The boy pushed us off the shore and had started poling us back to the other side when I saw dust on that upper road, maybe a half mile behind. I nodded at Bonin and we watched riders come our way. We was half crossed the river when four men rode into view on the south bank. Gimme the pole! Bonin yelled at the boy, and he grabbed for it. The boy would not let go, and they tussled a moment before Bonin simply grabbed the boy and hurled him from the barge. He hit the water with barely a splash. Bonin pulled his knife from its scabbard and began cutting the ropes leading up to the guideline. I saw what he meant to do. And I will give Bonin credit. It was likely our only chance. Were we to pole our way across that river, we’d be caught. They could ford faster than we could pole. But the current was strong enough that it could float us downstream almost as fast as those men could ride, and since the trail departed from the riverbank, we ought to make a bend or two and find a spot for a proper escape. In the river, the boy turned and swam with easy strokes toward the north shore. I wanted to tell him that I was sorry, but there was so much I was sorry for since Bonin and me first rode out of Kansas Territory, and there weren’t enough sorrys in this world. When I turned back Bonin had cut the ropes. We spun a little in the current, caught on a pulley, but then we swung free and soon our little barge was riding the current. I’ll be damned, I said. That’s how it was with Bonin. Scared and thrilled minute to minute. My pony stirred but I gripped her bridle and bid her quiet. On the south shore, the horses of the men who’d chased us settled in their dust. The last thing I saw before we rounded a bend was the swimming boy reaching the opposite shore. He pulled his hands to his mouth and called out something. A curse, maybe. I am sorry, I muttered again under my breath. Something I ought have told you, Bonin said. The Scots trapper and I quarreled with knives. Then you’ve ruined us, I told Bonin. I had worried about a few lashings, but it would mean the noose if those men caught us. The thought was barely out my mouth when I was yanked sidewise by the shoulder and there was a thud and the report of a rifle, the order of which seemed wrong, as if the wound in my shoulder and my horse’s staggering and the gunshot had nothing to do with one another. My horse, shot through the neck, pulled her cheekpiece from my hand and leaped from the barge, causing the boat to dip and rise and Bonin’s horse to stagger and fall off the other side, both animals now swimming to shore, mine with a wound in its neck, Bonin’s with our prize pelts waterlogged and dragging behind. And a piece of the ball that hit my pony had burrowed into the meat and bone of my shoulder. I am shot! I yelled to Bonin. We were both on our stomachs, clinging to the boards of the barge. We rounded another bend then and I could see the man who shot me, tracking us on a trail just above the south bank of the river. He’d shot from the saddle, a fancy piece of aim. Now he bore down again. A report cracked. And another. But these shots missed and the river raced us away until a cluster of boulders on the riverbank rose between him and us and the crack shot could not see to get off another round. The river was in full churn and we bumped along, rising and falling over rapids and unseen rocks, the raft turning this way and that. The barge pole had gone over with the horses and all our belongings. We had nothing to brake or steer that hurtling barge. It was just us two on this big thrashing vessel. Pain flared in my shoulder with each bump. Next eddy we’ll pull out, Bonin said, though the speed of that river did not bode well for eddies or for us controlling that barge. And still I seen the dust of riders pursuing us on the south shore. Bonin, I asked, was the Scots alive after your quarrel? He did not answer. But I knew. Probably the moment he rode into camp with the pelts I knew. I wondered if those men would treat my shoulder before hanging me. Still the river bucked beneath us, like an unrode colt, shoreline trees and ridges seeming to glide past. I cannot give account of this river except to say that it was a full torrent from the vast mountain lake from which it drained all the way to the Columbia. This Spokan was not some meandering Midwest trade river nor quaint fish stream but a blast of angry white water over hard rock bed. And even when we emerged in a couple of slower stretches, or when our big boat snagged on limbs, we could not disembark, for the banks were bouldered or overhung with heavy brush and no snag could hold us. We rounded more bends and passed a sliver of island. The southern riders had fallen back a bit, their dust faint. Perhaps the speed and harshness of that river might be our salvation after all. Bonin crawled across the boards and squinted into my shoulder. Is it mortal? I asked. I do not believe so, he said. But then he crawled back to his side of the barge. That’s when I saw dust on the road above the north bank of the river. So now we were being pursued on both shores. Sure enough, two riders emerged at a full gallop on the north river trail, on a rise above us. One was older and bearded and looked like he might be the French-Indian ferryman. The ferry boy was leading him on a smaller mount. I was our doom, Bonin said. I’ll not quarrel with that, I said. The river picked up pace again. Rose and fell like a nest of white serpents. We clung to our barge and watched, first one bank and then the other, as our pursuers dropped down to the river and then were forced to ride up and circle back on the bluff again, as terrain and brush warranted. I waited for the saddle-aim to try us again, but he could not get a clear shot. I was aware of a great sapping from my wound, as if I were draining from it. I lay with my face on those wet boards and I drifted in and out, rising and falling on the rapids, and I don’t know how much time passed. We snagged a few times more on rocks and tree branches but always we pulled off before Bonin could get us to shore. One sandbar willow reached for us and Bonin grabbed hold, but the current was barely amused and he was left with nothing but a handful of leaves. I feared I was becoming too weak to swim. The river was too fast, too high. And the few stretches where we might have made shore were also reachable from the river roads and the men chasing us—trappers on the south side, the boy and the old ferryman on the north. So we held on. And we rose and fell, scraped by rocks and limbs. I felt the heaviest sleep I have ever known settle about my head. My arm went numb like the empty sleeve of a coat. Shame you fell in with me, Bonin said. I looked up at him. My own character is at fault, I said. We talked like this as we clung to that ferry, looking across the wet boards into each other’s eyes. I can tell you, at the end, you marvel at those. Human eyes. I thought of my mother’s easy blues and the bark-browns of the boy who had just taken us across the river. How many hundreds of eyes in between? And how many more I would never see, Bonin’s green demons to be my last. Bonin seemed to know my gloomy thinking. Listen, he said, I need to tell you about this river. There is a great falls, six or seven steps, the last one twenty feet of drop. In summer the tribes gather at these falls to fish, but now? So recent to snow and the river running like this? He shook his head. Be hell’s churn. We’ll be dashed onto rocks and what pieces left thrown over into a deep canyon. Maybe we’ll survive, I said. Maybe we will be the first to make it over. I smiled, and tried to think of our old adventures. He didn’t answer. The river had finally slowed again and the trail on the north shore dipped down to us. The boy and the old ferryman rode alongside us now at a fast trot. The boy was as close as he’d been since we were on the barge together. Almost as if we were traveling together, him by road, me by river. I wondered if he had a rope to throw us. Forgive me, Bonin said, and at first I thought he was talking to the boy, saying what I was thinking about stealing his barge. But when I turned back I saw Bonin slide off our punt into the river and swim for shore. He made that awful stroke of his, flailing, flapping, gulping, the current pulling him alongside the barge, so that I could still see his face, until it went under and resurfaced ten feet away, him still trying to make shore. He glanced back my way and our eyes connected again. Sure now of his folly, he thrashed back to the barge, scrabbled his hands on the side. I tried to pull myself over to help him up but I was too weak. And the next time I saw Bonin he was just a human back and hair, floating alongside our barge—and then gone. I forgive you, I said. I did not see the riders on the south bank again, but the boy on the north shore had separated from the French ferryman and rode along on the bluff ahead of me as if to cut me off. I was feeling sleepy. Water sloshed the side of the barge and I could taste my own blood. I thought of my mother again. And my father, buried two years past. I wondered if my sisters had all married off. And I thought of that Indian boy. I had thought him to be no more than ten, but by the way he rode I saw he was older. I imagined the French ferryman angry for him losing the barge and again I wished to apologize. I was only seventeen. That boy and I might have ridden together in another world. Foolish thought. There is no other world. The river had picked up speed again but this time it felt different. Like every current in the world pulled into a single reckoning. I could see a great dip ahead. I wondered if this was the first of them falls Bonin had described. I thought again of the glory of being the first man to go over these falls. And then I remembered the boy and his tribe, living God’s eternity along these banks. I wondered what the boy would make of white men like me claiming to be the first across this pass, first to this mountain lake, first over these falls, naming streams the boy’s people had fished for centuries. Like someone coming into your home and naming your bed in honor of the queen. Maybe one of his people had gone over these falls and lived to tell. Maybe the boy would share the story with me one day. This thought gave me some branch of hope and I sat up to see where the river would take me. I felt dizzy and had the strange thought that I needed to stay awake for the plunge. The boy and his pony were waiting on a ridge twenty yards downstream. As I approached I raised my good arm to the boy. Watch! I called. I cannot say why I yelled this except I imagined that if I were witnessed now I might continue to exist, even if just as a tale the boy thrilled his grandchildren with—the scoundrel who stole a ferry and rode it over the great falls. Then the boy did something remarkable. From the back of his pony, he raised his hand to me as I went by and called out the way you might to a rider you recognize, a friend, three short triumphant yelps, a song whose meaning I would never know but which, as my barge passed him, I took to mean: I see you. There is no world but this one. And all we can ask in the brief moment we inhabit it is to be seen. I see you, the boy said. And I was grateful. And then my barge seized up beneath me, front end risen like God reached down from heaven to pluck me from the water with His great forgiving thunderclap hand, but I had merely run against a boulder that split the current and my vessel in two, and, riven to sin and salvation, I tumbled to the smaller end of my broken punt and clung to its side in wet tumult till I looked back and could scarcely believe what I had done. I had gone over. Fallen eight, perhaps ten feet on half a raft and lived to tell it! I looked up to the north shore for the boy and tried to make the whoop sound he had made—but I was weak and this first stairstep had been the easiest, what came next surely would be my end. Above and behind me, the boy sat atop his pony on that grassy ledge—his widened eyes mirroring my thoughts: Did you see that! He began to raise his hand once more (this to be the end of the story he would tell his grandchildren—As he went over, I waved) and I went to lift my own arm in response, but before either of us could finish the movement the next step came and I was taken by the cold froth that awaits— Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. “An unexpectedly excellent magazine that stands out amid a homogenized media landscape.” —the New York Times"

        "story": "Today I did something and I have no idea why I did it. I followed someone, two people actually, but it was the woman I was really following, the man just happened to be accompanying her. It started on an airplane. I had awakened at four to catch a six-forty flight, so perhaps there is some explanation in the fact that I was very, very tired. It was a six-hour trip and I had slept for only two of the hours. I always wait to be one of the last to leave the plane if I have a bag in the overhead compartment because I’m afraid I’ll fumble the bag and injure a fellow passenger and have to endure the lifelong consequences, or at least the temporary embarrassment. So I was standing, literally at the edge of my seat, when I saw her. I paid attention because she was almost brained by a young man carelessly flinging his bag from the overhead compartment. It was the look on her face that got me: she expected him to apologize, she believed she had a right to an apology, and he did not make even the slightest gesture toward apology. She was surprised, really surprised, and I understood that she was used to being apologized to, that she believed it was her right that her life go smoothly. I noticed that her posture was very good for a woman her age—she was at least in her seventies, though it’s getting harder and harder to judge: nonagenarians are becoming increasingly sprightly. She was dressed much too warmly for that July day, and I couldn’t imagine why she was wearing that hat, a softened squashed-down version of a top hat. I had seen hats like that for sale on Broadway, laid out on rickety tables beside pashminas and fake Louis Vuitton fanny packs. Photograph © Robert Holmgren I could never imagine why anyone would buy those hats: their fabric so proudly inorganic, the colors acidic or muddy. This one was cerise or fuchsia, and the words are much prettier than the color of the hat deserved. Here was this woman, who had not been apologized to, whose carriage suggested only two possible words—“well bred”—wearing this hat, which would have been a mistake in December but in July was nothing short of a calamity. I noticed a finely wrought leather purse strapped across her body like a bandolier. Her hands were extravagantly free, and she swung her arms much more vigorously than the narrow aisle warranted. I have never seen hands so free. The freedom of her hands made her companion’s burdens seem more extreme than perhaps they were. She was all in black, her pantsuit soft wool, and the abovementioned hat. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a print of parrots. He was pushing one suitcase on wheels; in the other hand he carried a plastic bag that was obviously lunch, and looped over his wrist was a cloth bag with a print of three more loud parrots, each monochrome: one red, one yellow, the green one the color of an industrial-strength cleaner. They were heading toward a connecting flight. I had a car waiting at curbside to take me home. I should have headed straight for the exit; my phone said the driver would leave after four minutes. Instead I followed them. They stopped for a moment to watch a plane take off. I stopped a few feet in front of them, then walked a few more feet so I could turn around and get a good look at them from the front. She walked several steps ahead of him. I’m not sure whether to call her handsome or hatchet-faced; he could only be called a schlub. His hair was stringy and much too long; his shirt didn’t quite close over his potbelly. I let them pass me. All I knew was that I had to follow them. I needed to know where they were going. They stopped at the gate that was marked for a flight to Manchester, New Hampshire. I sat across from them. They were entirely silent. My phone pinged, warning me that I was going to have to pay a hefty penalty for standing my driver up. I sat, pretending to read something on my phone, until they rose to board their flight. They disappeared through the door and they were gone, gone completely, as if I had never seen them, as if they had never been. I took the train home to the city in penance for my folly. It was crowded and took more than an hour and a half. I had to stand, I couldn’t read or sleep or do anything but let my mind wander. I tried to understand why I had followed the people in the airport. And I could come up with nothing. I tried to remember other things that I had done for which I could provide no explanation. I remembered something that had happened the summer between first and second grade. A new girl had moved next door. Her name enchanted me: it was Leonie. I had never heard of anyone named Leonie. And I was riveted by the fact that her mother seemed to pronounce her name two different ways: sometimes she would call out Lay-oh-knee and sometimes Lee-own-ee. I knew it wasn’t that she had two names, but I was jealous that she could appear to have two—it seemed a largesse to which I would never have access. She had tight, brass-colored curls; her sandals always looked immaculate. This is all I remember about her. She knew more children in our class than I did, that is knew them well enough to invite them to play, and this day she had collected four or five, six perhaps, on her screened-in back porch. Then we moved into the garage, but she, the unquestioned leader, grew tired of that very quickly. Why did I go back into the garage? Had I left something there? I don’t remember. I went back in, and there, lying on the lower rungs of a ladder that was propped up against the edge of some kind of storage loft, was one of my classmates, whom I will call W in case he reads this and will be embarrassed, though I can’t imagine he would read it and I don’t actually know why it would embarrass him. He was lying like an odalisque, one hand behind his head, his legs crossed, one foot making small circles in the air. His head was turned to one side, as if he were studying something on the opposite garage wall. I thought he might be asleep, but no, he was making those small circles in the air. He was wearing black-and-white basketball sneakers. I walked over to the small window that was on the wall opposite the one at which W was staring. I stood there, still, silent. The light came through the window in straight thick bands. A beam of light fell on his neck, which was exposed, as he had turned his head away. I thought his neck, exposed, the light falling on it, was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I tiptoed over to him and kissed his neck where the light fell on it. Then, slowly, I walked out of the garage. Soon Leonie moved away. W was in my class for another seven years, but we never spoke. I remember once all the boys made fun of him because he came to school with a tie too long for him; it hung below his belt. He was close to tears. He said he couldn’t find his tie, and had taken one of his father’s because he knew he’d get in trouble for not wearing a tie. I did not come to his defense. I wasn’t even tempted. I was eleven when I did the other thing. It was the end of August and in a few weeks I would be entering seventh grade. I hadn’t yet gotten my period and I was longing for the event. I remember that I was wearing orange-and-yellow-check Bermuda shorts. I knew they were hideous, but I had chosen them so I was stuck. It was the last evening of my mother’s and my vacation. We were visiting old friends of hers in Elmira, New York. My mother was forty-one when I was born, old enough to be my grandmother, and the people we were visiting had a granddaughter a year younger than me. It was assumed we would like each other; but I had crossed some line into preadolescence and she was moored in late childhood. Because of this she looked up to me, and because I had never been looked up to, only looked down on, I naturally became sadistic. For the first time I had a real friend at school, a best friend, and I resented being separated from her even for a week, having to spend my time with a “child” or listening to the reminiscences of my mother and her friends. I wrote long self-pitying letters to my best friend, a new one every day. I reported that the child didn’t even read, that her mother packed a suitcase full of books for her and she never even opened one. Every day after lunch, the adults left the child and me alone at the town swimming pool, where I left her to her own devices at poolside while I swam laps. My mother’s friends took us all for a farewell dinner at an outdoor restaurant at the foot of a mountain. At the top of the mountain was a blinking light, perhaps a television tower. I was seized with an urge to climb the mountain to get to the flashing light. I was reading a lot of biographies of heroic women at the time, and it seemed to be the time for me to climb a mountain. The adults were lingering over coffee. I grabbed the child’s hand and told her we were going to climb the mountain. The late-August sun was setting earlier than it had a week before. There was nothing lovely about the climb. The terrain was all scrub: rough weeds and thorny branches covered with burrs that stuck to our shorts. It was starting to get dark. The child held on to my hand. She didn’t say a word. Up and up we went, and there was no joy in it. If I had imagined exhilaration, there was none. But I kept my eye on the winking light. And then, suddenly, it was dark, and I was frightened but I couldn’t admit it. The child started to cry. I pretended to be annoyed at her pusillanimity and agreed to head back down to where the adults were waiting at the table. We hadn’t even made it halfway. The adults, even my mother, were so relieved to see us that they forgot to scold. At no time did my mother even bring the matter up, although I knew I had shamed her. Both of us feared the strangeness in me that could inspire such ardor. The train entered a long tunnel. The darkness was complete. Always when I am in complete darkness I have the sense that it is possible that I am not alive: everything has the clarity that could only be open to the recently dead. It came to me then. Some things are not understandable. No understanding is possible. I will never understand. And then the tunnel ended. The train pulled into the station. I could see people—porters, conductors, passengers—standing on the platform, none of them too near the edge. We all seemed real, alive, and living lives beyond our understanding.

        "story": "I was seventy when I met Richard. He was thirty-two. He told me he was a young man, and I didn’t respond to that because I really didn’t know what that was, to be a young man, if that was a good thing to be or a bad one. He had moved in next door to us, me and Rose, my granddaughter, in January. She was hardly home that summer. She had gotten together with a new guy and was mostly at his place across town. All my friends were in assisted living, but I wasn’t. We didn’t have the money, and besides, I didn’t care much about going. I didn’t want to be around people I didn’t know. “Lucas,” by Emily Porter © The artist Richard had parties at his place every Saturday. At first, it was just the housewarming, and then it was other things. His apartment was an open door, people coming in and out at all hours. Sometimes there were just kids, little ones, over there, with Christmas lights all over the floor. Other times it was middle-aged people crawling through some tent maze built out of cardboard boxes. He even had a party where people brought over their bikes, and we took a tour of the city with him. I did not have a bike, so he let me ride with him. I sat on the bar in front of the seat and he pedaled. He told us stories, personal ones, about his time living here. He’d been in the city for a few years. On the bike tour, he told us about a woman he’d loved once, his roommate. Where they ate in the city and skipped out on a bill, the places they kissed. The city became his with those stories. When I walked by that building, that corner, his stories were there, the way he told them. “There’s no such thing as love. It’s a construct,” Richard told me one day when I went over to his apartment. I had gotten a package of his in my mail. “You know anyone who is in love?” I thought of Rose, who always said she was in love whenever she met a new guy and then would wait by the phone all day, crying. Then I thought of my friends and my own experience. We had all known it, but it was something that happened a long time ago, not something we sat around thinking about. It happened, and when it’s happened, there is no need to think too hard about it. “Maybe,” I said, “you haven’t had much time to know a range of people.” He told me he knew a lot of people. Thousands was the number he gave me. I got the feeling that what I wanted to say to him was about the quality of closeness, not what he was talking about. A few minutes passed between us, and he said, “People say that they are in love all the time, but they’re not. I don’t believe them. They think they should say it because it’s what you say. Doesn’t mean they really know what it is.” I looked around his apartment. There wasn’t much in it. A few plastic chairs, a couch he had dragged back from someone’s front lawn, a table, and a little anatomy man. The anatomy man had little plastic bits inside. I reached inside him and took out a small brown thing the size of a pencil eraser. I didn’t know what it was and put it back. Richard liked to talk about the women he had slept with. There were two he brought up a lot. The first was his roommate, whom he didn’t talk to anymore, the one he told us about on the bike tour. The second was a woman named Eve. She lived in New York now but came back once in a while to visit. He said he wasn’t in love with her, that they were best friends. They had, for seven years, been a couple, but then they weren’t anymore. The chemistry wasn’t there. When she didn’t answer his emails or phone calls, he would google her. He always wanted to know what she was doing. I asked him, “Do you think maybe you’re in love with her?” He said no, to be in love, you should have sex with that person, and he didn’t want that with her. He asked me if I’d had sex with anyone lately. I took my time to answer. I could tell he had no use for anyone who didn’t have sex. I tried to remember the last time. I hadn’t been with anyone but my husband. He died thirty years ago. A heart attack. Sudden. Thirty years is a lifetime for some people. As far as I was concerned, I hadn’t had sex for such a long time that I could consider myself a virgin. I couldn’t remember how it all happens. Richard knew how. He was always talking about all the sex he’d had. Hundreds of women, he told me. “It’s easy. You just ask. And you never know. If someone tells me no, I don’t get worked up about it. I mean, they said no. What’s more clear than that? There are always others who want to. It’s sometimes just athletic to do it.” Richard was not a beauty but he acted like one. He said, “I’m not bad-looking. Anyway, looks don’t have anything to do with it. Sometimes good-looking people don’t do anything in bed. They just lie there. You want someone who has imagination, who is excited. It’s the best feeling ever.” Richard had one of his parties. This party was different from the others. There wasn’t any food, and it began later in the evening. There was a green glass bottle in the middle of the room. All his furniture had been cleared, piled on one side of the room. For all his talk, I had never seen him with a woman before. I knew what the bottle in the middle of the room was for. I looked around the room, at the twenty-five or so people, to see if there was anyone I would hope it would land on. There wasn’t, but I wanted to play. When I spun the bottle, it landed on a beautiful blond woman. A lawyer. She was still in her business suit, with the jacket. I kissed her on the forehead, like she was some child, and everyone laughed. Richard said, “Isn’t she sweet?” I hated that he said that. I didn’t want to be sweet. I was old and I knew it and I had been called a lot of words, but “sweet” really irritated me. I watched as those who were chosen by the bottle kissed each other. After a while, it got boring. The people at the party thought so, too, and started to file out. It was Richard’s turn again, and each time it was, he always spent a long time with that person, kissing. There was a man with a beer belly whom he kissed, and a dancer. I didn’t want to go home. It was the start of summer, and I wanted something to happen to me. Richard told me, “You could go home, if you want. We’re just going to keep playing this game. It might get boring.” But I didn’t go. There were three of us now. The other woman was named Lorrie. She worked at an art gallery. Lorrie behaved like she was a girl. Giggling, chewing on her long hair, blushing. When Richard spun the green bottle, it landed on me. He laughed, and said, “You don’t have to. You can say no.” But I didn’t want to, to say no. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor, and I leaned over. He chewed spearmint gum. When we stopped, she was gone. He said, “It’s three in the morning. You should go home.” He said it like a good friend who was looking out for me. I got the sense too that Richard didn’t like me being there at that time, alone with him, like he was afraid of what an old woman wanted. “I don’t want to,” I said. I don’t know why I said that. Just to see what he would do. He was a man, and I was bored. His bedroom was clean and quiet. I said, “Can you take off your clothes? I want to see.” It surprised me, how he listened. He didn’t protest like I thought he would. He didn’t say it was a bad idea. He stood there naked. He was beautiful, the way women are. He had hair on his chest and legs. I hadn’t seen hair on a chest for a long time and so I reached out to touch it. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. It was so easy. He sat down on the bed and I sat on top of him. He didn’t go in deep, but held me there. I was supposed to lower myself. But I didn’t. I could go as far as I wanted. The morning light came in, and he said, “We have to stop.” I didn’t want to. I liked looking at Richard’s face when he held me there. He looked scared, or like he was about to cry. Then he lifted me off of him and turned around so I couldn’t see his face. He said, “You have to go. I want to fuck you.” And that’s why I didn’t want to go. Because he wanted that. I didn’t see Richard for a few weeks. He had his parties and people came and went. I heard their talk through the walls, and the women too. I wanted to know what it would feel like to have a sound like that in my mouth. But it was only the women. He was silent, breathing quietly, probably. I asked him why he never made any noises, not even a grunt. “Concentrating,” he said. He always talked that way. Easily. He told me what it felt like, for him, for a man, and what it was like having sex with a woman. I had never known that, but he did. He told me things I wished I could have asked my mother when I was a young girl, but this was better because he gave me facts. I wanted to know how he knew where to put himself, if it was the same each time, how he got them to come home to his apartment, how he undressed them. He always asked them, Can I do this? Is this all right? You’re okay with this? The way he told it to me, it was like I had done it, too, had also been inside them, just like him, as a man. There was no metaphor, no seed and soil and growing flowers. Just the facts. “What have you been doing all summer?” Rose asked me one afternoon when she came home. I knew how she would react if I told her. When she left for the weekend, I knocked on Richard’s door. I tried the doorknob and went in. I could hear the shower going, and when he came out, he said, “You hungry?” Just like that. He was a good cook. I watched him cook. Bringing out plates, the pan, opening the cupboards, the fridge. He looked graceful. His long legs and arms. I liked that he wasn’t mad at me for what happened last time, after the party, when we had gotten so close. “Why would I be?” he said. “Don’t have sex with men who get mad about things like that.” He smiled at me and said, “I liked that nothing really happened. We were close. That’s the best part. To be that close. And to let nothing happen.” Soon after, we were sitting on the edge of the bed. I sat on top and I had Richard between my legs. We had been kissing. It started off really slow. And then I kissed harder. Then he pulled his mouth away from mine. His mouth was open, and he was breathing heavily. His head tilted back when mine leaned forward. We were so close, breathing into each other. Then I lowered myself onto him and said, before I pushed further, “Do you want me to pull out?” I meant stop, but I didn’t say that. He knew what I meant and why I didn’t say that. He laughed, and said, “No, no. God, no.” His lips were red, his cheeks pink. I wanted him to say it, even though I knew it wasn’t true. “Tell me you love me,” I said. “Even if it’s not true. Say it.” And he did. I wanted to feel what it was like to have someone inside me again, and I pushed him into me. It was the end of August, and Richard didn’t have his parties as often. We were spending more time alone together. He’d call me on the phone and ask whether I wanted to come over. I knew what he wanted me over for, and I wanted that, too. I went over whenever he called. Sometimes we spent the whole day together, not talking at all. And sleeping. We didn’t have much to say, doing what we did. What I liked about the sex we had was how slow it was, and how long we could go, how he waited for my body to respond. When we began it was usually dark outside, and then we stopped when there was light. He told me, “You should get a boyfriend. I can’t be your boyfriend.” I didn’t want a boyfriend, whatever that was these days. I wanted what I had. I didn’t say anything. I just watched him put on his clothes. Then he asked me if I wanted to go with him to see Eve the next day; she was in town, and she wanted him to meet her new boyfriend. He said he didn’t want to go alone. It was the first time I did anything with him outside the apartment. I stood on the front porch of a house, on a small street, and Richard went inside to get Eve. She was in the back of the house, where the kitchen was. She called to me to come inside, waved me in. She had long, shiny black hair and brown eyes. She said her boyfriend was upstairs taking a shower and that he’d join us in a few minutes. Richard talked to Eve, asked her about this new man of hers, teased her about him, about being in love. Then Richard said, “Well, I’m in love,” and pointed to me. “With her.” We laughed, Richard and I, as if this were our joke and Eve were outside it. You can do that with a joke, hide how you feel and mean what you say at the same time, and no one would ask you which it was. Eve’s boyfriend, Daniel, came down the stairs in a white T-shirt that clung to his chest and plain khaki shorts. “Hey, guys, how is everyone?” I didn’t reply because it wasn’t really directed at me. Richard answered for himself. That morning, we played board games and charades. Eve and Richard had a way of talking with each other that made it difficult to join in. They made references and jokes and told stories about each other in bits and pieces that never came together because they’d break out in laughter. They never bothered to explain what any of this was about, always saying we would have had to be there to know. I had been around. I knew what was happening. Richard was oblivious to what Eve was doing with him. Playing the two men off each other. I got up and went out to the front porch. It was only three in the afternoon. I thought of going home, and then Daniel came out for a smoke. He lit his cigarette and we watched the trees around us. The leaves were far apart from one another; they waved, darted left and right. Pushed by the wind, they looked like a school of fish in the blue sky. A thing out of place. We did not know what to say to each other. We were there at the same time and wanting the same thing, but from different people. If there were anyone else who understood what it was like to be on the outside looking in on those two, it was Daniel. After a while, he said to me, “You ever seen a tornado before?” I told him I hadn’t. He nodded and went on, “They destroy everything. You can see it coming in the distance. Most people would try to get the hell out of there. Some people see it coming and can’t help but watch.” I didn’t say anything. He winked at me. I had only known him for a few hours that day. He saw me. Afterward, Richard thought it would be a great idea to bike around the city. Eve and Daniel didn’t want to go, so it was just us again. We arranged our bodies on the bike like we had done once before, me on the bar in front of the seat, and he pedaled. We went around like this, without helmets. I wasn’t scared of getting into an accident. That’s what it felt like then, to be with Richard. I didn’t think about what would happen to me, what the future would look like. I was in it. I had had a life and had still gotten there. Richard biked past the crowd at the ferry dock, and we followed the trail out of the city until we got to the lake. We weren’t supposed to swim in it because it was polluted, but he did, saying there was nothing wrong with it. He swam far out but close enough for me to see him pretend he was drowning. His arms waved about and his head bobbed. Then he swam out farther and did it all over again. We returned to his apartment. He told me his friendship with Eve was changing. She was getting on with her life, without him. She didn’t drop everything to see him anymore. “I should marry her,” he said. “I love her and I don’t want to lose her.” I did not tell him what to do about her. I did not ask what it would mean for me. He took off his clothes. One by one, and then mine. The afternoon had changed him somehow. He had always been very tender with me but was even more so now. He put himself down on the bed and closed his eyes. I took him in. I did it slowly. “Yes,” he said. I wanted to put something inside him that we could both see come in and out. I put a finger into his belly button, and he got so loud about it, like the women I heard him with through the wall of the apartment. I was quiet, breathing, taking everything in. Then he gasped like something was about to happen to him. He sat up and pulled me closer. He kissed me very hard and did not pull away. We continued like that, face to face. I love you, he kept saying. He asked me to sleep over, but I didn’t want to. I watched him with a sadness he couldn’t see. I didn’t want to be with someone who could do that—who could deny me of what he would give someone else. He had the time to have regrets, to be stupid. I didn’t. And when he turned around, I don’t know why I did what I did. I reached out and grabbed a piece inside the anatomy man. It was his stomach. A small plastic thing. It wasn’t real, of course, but it was there, and it was something. I went home and was surprised to find Rose there. She asked me where I had been, said she knew that I was spending a lot of time with that guy next door. She said, “He’s never going to love you, you know. Have you forgotten how old you are? Look at all your wrinkles.” That’s the thing about being old. We don’t know we have wrinkles until we see them. Old is a thing that happened outside. A thing other people see about us. I didn’t know why she was talking to me this way. I didn’t know whether she meant this about me or whether she was telling herself. I didn’t say anything. It seemed to me she’d been drinking, so I let her talk. After a while, I didn’t hear anything she said. My mind was somewhere else. I did see Richard one last time, later that year, in October. It was at Daniel’s funeral. Richard was there, with Eve, supporting her, holding her, like a partner. It seemed strange to me to have done the things people who loved each other did, so often, and for it to seem now like they had never happened. And it seemed strange to me to see him go back to her, to want so little. And what kind of person was Eve to see someone else’s love and agree to see it wasn’t there. But after a while, it didn’t matter to think about it. I looked over at the closed casket and thought of Daniel, how he died. He was a strong swimmer, in excellent shape, but it was very cold, he got a cramp, and he drowned. I thought of him and his whole life, how short it was. Forty. That isn’t much time. I was there with him when he loved someone, and he was willing to wait it out. I wondered whether, in life, you get one big role, some message you need to deliver to someone, and when it’s done, it’s time to go. I thought of what Daniel said about tornadoes. He was wrong about me. What he said wasn’t true. We weren’t the same. I did not wait. I am not the kind of person who watches something happen in the distance. Daniel’s family and friends stood up and told stories about him. I did not tell mine. It was for no one to know, and I left. I looked back at the black everyone was wearing. I could not tell which one in the crowd was Richard. I was beginning to forget his face. Once, walking down the street in front of my old building, Richard called out to me. I must have been closing in on eighty then. I looked through him and spun around. I wanted to be in the distance, beautiful and dark, spinning all by myself, in the clear. I didn’t want him to come close. Nothing, not even the call of my name, could make me stop.\b Timeless stories from our 175-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of the day. “An unexpectedly excellent magazine that stands out amid a homogenized media landscape.” —the New York Times"

He never saw him at work, of course, and most likely he had a drill— something air-compressed, high-end. It wasn’t 1947, after all. His wife had been born in 1975. He was from 1977 himself. A pie sat amid the papers. Comfort food, as Mrs. Rendon said to him. Her car was often in his driveway now, even though she couldn’t have lived more than two hundred yards away. He tended to measure in football fields because football was one of the sports that his boys played. “Mrs. Rendon really should walk,” he thought as he grabbed a piece of pie. It struck him that he would have to return to work at some point. He thought about how he was not dead, and how people just expected you to be able to pretend you were alive. In the hospital, everyone watched the television. Some laughed. Life didn’t stop so much that you couldn’t laugh— even he had, once or twice. He thought of that too as he bent over the sink and threw up the pie. The television in the hospital was always on the same station, as if governed by some entertainment-industry bylaw. He thought of his wife’s instructions in these matters. “Relax, now, Ted,” she had said when he lost his job and Clay had been recovering from pneumonia and Danny was having his trouble, which meant counseling sessions. “We’ll get through this.” Danny was getting beaten up every day behind the dumpster before he went to school. Getting beaten up, it turned out, because he asked the other kids to beat him up. Neither he nor his wife understood why, and neither did the kids, but they complied anyway, kids being kids until the end of time. “Relax, now, Ted,” his wife had said when his mother died after he had stopped speaking to her for three months. It had been one of those small arguments, dredged up like something from a trawler, something that should have stayed on the bottom. You’re supposed to let those things be. But he was always too anxious, too eager, wanting to improve things. He wanted to be a better parent. His wife was the one the boys came to. His duties lay elsewhere, as far as they were concerned. Ice cream man. He took them for treats after his wife had done the fixing-up. His job was to pretend that this trip to the Dairy Queen represented a new start. Now things would get better. Half a puzzle had been assembled on his watch, but mostly thanks to his wife’s love and counsel. “Fuck that,” he thought, looking at the chunks of piecrust in the sink. He laughed. You never think it’s good to be alone, save when you laugh when you shouldn’t. You have to be alone for that. That’s the company you’re after.  Mrs. Rendon had been thinner when his mother died, and she had taken the boys to her house. His wife joked about how she had flirted with him during a game of Trivial Pursuit. There was talk on the block of Mr. Rendon being a swinger: he looked like Charles Atlas, he did push-ups in the driveway. When he did them in his garage, in the winter, because he had a space heater in there, he opened the door first. A couple of days before his wife was diagnosed, Danny had taken such a beating that you could hardly recognize his face before it was cleaned off. The blood from his mouth and nose was all over his throwback Star Wars shirt. He had hugged the boy, who didn’t hug him back. His wife led Danny away, quickly. She took him into the living room. The name struck him as ironic now, as he wiped his mouth and rinsed out the sink and ran the garbage disposal, Mrs. Rendon’s pie disappearing for a second time. His wife had whispered over her shoulder to him, as if Danny wouldn’t be able to hear, words about getting a warm, wet towel and leaving it by the door. He wasn’t offended. He was never offended. But he wanted to take the boys to Little League practice a couple of days later. Just him. Normally his wife would go if she was free. The boys talked to him then, jabbering from the back seat— even Danny, who had a slight whistle in his voice now that a tooth had been chipped. After his wife died, he had read a pamphlet about how the return of routine was essential for young children. Return of routine. He liked the acronym you could make from that: ROR. Like the sound a lion made, just down a letter. A diminished lion— but a lion still. He had roared weakly when he cut himself shaving that day, then patched up his face and took the boys to Little League. Return of routine. Now the boys didn’t talk much to him from the back seat. When they talked to each other, they whispered. They would talk to Mrs. Rendon when she came over. She waited outside the bathroom while they showered, listening, hands folded on her lap. Clay had stopped using full sentences, but that seemed normal enough: he, too, had to force himself to use any words at all when he encountered another human being. Danny’s face was still bandaged. Maybe that’s why Mrs. Rendon waited for him to emerge from the shower, on medical grounds. The boy could have been Boris Karloff in a mummy movie— in fact, he had been a mummy once for Halloween, encouraged by one of his teachers. The teacher drank. Danny stayed after a lot. He had always struggled. They told him he was smart, because he was in some ways. A whiz when it came to jigsaws, and anything with numbers too. He could compute a player’s batting average inside of three seconds, boom, just like that. The teacher gave Danny something to drink. He called it an energy drink that would help him focus. Danny got light-headed. He asked if he could lie down to rest. The teacher jerked him off on a soapstone table. He could still see the white from the semen, or what he imagined was the semen, when he learned what happened and then arrived at the school the next morning and banged the teacher’s head against that table. He did not consult his wife in the matter. The teacher was fired. Sentenced to something. He didn’t care what. Which was ironic. You’d think you’d care a great deal about that if that happened to your boy. He had cared more about getting his hands on the man. Everyone doing things with hands. His son wouldn’t talk to him much after that. That’s when the beatings behind the dumpster started. Clay would talk to him at least, and the two of them would sit in the family room and watch ball games while Danny and his mother were in the bedroom. Maybe Danny knew about the diagnosis before he did. Maybe that’s why he had to stay with her. A soaker-up-of-seconds. You want to hoard time when you know certain things.  There was a fresh pie every Friday going forward, after it became just the three of them. He wondered how long the Rendons would keep at it, being their personal bakers. Surely the pie was not indefinite. He tried that joke out one night in the bedroom, to himself, aloud. Doing his bad jokes alone. Seemed therapeutic. The boys had stopped moving down the hall. They didn’t talk after they went to bed. Now two feet walked to the bathroom and turned on the faucet, then two more, the water being turned on harder. Whispers from the bathroom. He waited for the flow of water to stop, listening for the sound of those four feet again, but he heard only a vague shuffle, like silk sweeping over brick, and the door to the bedroom closing again. As his wife was dying, and he was watching her die, he found himself wondering how long you were supposed to stay at the hospital after. What the policy was. Did you leave quickly, because this was the worst moment of your life— worse, he was ashamed to admit, than having a kid die? That was wrong, he figured. You wouldn’t want to say that to anyone. Clay was eleven, but he held him on his lap afterward in a private room for two hours, until the boy became dehydrated from crying. Danny’s face had been stitched up from another session behind the dumpster. That would be the last one. Boys will be boys until the end of time, but boys also lay off after a certain point. “Can I stay with the Rendons?” Danny had asked, after Clay was hooked up to an IV. “I don’t want to be in the house. I don’t want to be in the house with just you.” He didn’t want to be in the house with just him, either. At that point, he hadn’t yet hit upon his therapeutic device of the bad jokes you weren’t supposed to laugh at. “Yes,” he said, his own voice sounding flatter to him than the sheerest canyon wall. So he said it again. “Yes. You can.” Alone again, he drove to the school where he had beaten the teacher and sat in his car, looking at the window of the classroom where he used to think his boy had been lost to him. He remembered how his wife would usher him to some event at the school, and how proud she would look when she gazed upon her children doing one of those meaningless things: picking something up off the ground, winking at one of their friends, forgetting to cover their mouths when they coughed, getting it right the next time. When she gazed at him, it was a different look. He didn’t wish to call it warmer. That would be wrong. It was a look of confluence. Not mine, not yours: ours. As he wept and fought back an urge to scream, another vehicle pulled up behind him. He was worried it was the cops, but then he recognized the familiar Subaru. Mr. Rendon liked to park it along the edge of his driveway after he washed it so you could see him do push-ups. He saw the heads of his boys in the back seat. The Rendons shut off the lights, and everyone sat where they were. Not everyone gives you time to stop crying so you can face your kids, he thought. Not everyone has a pair of Rendons. He barely noticed when they drove off, and suddenly Danny opened the passenger door, and he and Clay pushed into the front seat. Danny reached out across his brother with a balled-up fist. His father took it in his hand. The boy in the middle only closed his eyes. His wife would not have spoken, he was certain of that, if she had been in this car, nor would she have expected him to. Where there is no center, there are also no edges. There is space giving way to space giving way to space— a father holding his sons, with nothing silted over, no silt at all, a bottom of a sea.

        "story": "He had wanted to make sure she wouldn’t write about him, but he knew he couldn’t ask her outright not to write about him, since he was sure such a question would set off a lecture about how he was not within his rights to put restrictions on her work, and she might even tease him for being narcissistic enough to believe that she was planning to write about him, and he would take issue with that word— “narcissistic”— a diagnosis she was well aware he’d often feared his friends and acquaintances might have been, all along, privately giving him— and he would insist it was merely practical, not narcissistic, to assume that she, his ex-wife, whose two previous books had contained many arguably autobiographical details, might choose to include some or many details that might appear, to some, to have been lifted from their complicated years together and their not exactly undramatic ending, but she would probably respond to this by saying that it was ridiculous and childish of him to accuse her of writing autobiography— especially since he knew how much trouble such accusations had caused her in the past— and even if she did end up writing something that contained some or many details that echoed her life (as every writer did or had done at some point or sometimes constantly), she knew that he knew that she was not interested in writing memoir, and she knew that he knew that she was, as a reader and as a writer, interested only in work that used the tangibility of character and plot as a method of elucidating intangible ideas, not to record a personal history, and even if she did write a character who somewhat resembled him she could never really write about him, the truest and realest him, because there was no such thing as an immovable, constant self, and even if there were such a thing she certainly couldn’t claim she knew his, or if she did it was far too abstract to put into words, and, anyway, he had always seemed either incapable of or indifferent to being emotionally vulnerable with her and even after all their years together she was still baffled and deeply hurt by the sudden revelation of his secret cruelty and the damage he had been capable of inflicting on her, so of course she wasn’t going to write about him, because she had clearly never known him— and no matter how many times he would try to interrupt this tirade (which all the while would have been increasing in speed and volume), he would not be able to speak loudly or forcefully enough to correct her original misunderstanding of what he had said (of course he didn’t think that she wrote autobiography), but by the time she had finished her speech he would be too tired to say anything else, and his being too tired to make his case would be the equivalent of raising a white flag, a submission that might later double as his waiving any right to be dismayed by the inclusion of some phrase or plot element or character in her next work that he might recognize, whether narcissistically or correctly, as being based on something he had said or done or been. Illustration by Leigh Wells So he never directly asked her not to write about him, as he estimated it would cause more problems than it could possibly assuage, yet he felt unable to stop craving some sort of assurance that she would not write about him, or at least that she would not write about him in a way that was immediately recognizable, but the longer he dwelled on it and the more he talked about it in therapy and the more he talked about it in his head to the imagined company of his therapist for the rest of the week, the more he realized that part of his desire to make sure that she would not write about him was an even stronger desire for her to write about him constantly, a desire for her to feel his absence so profoundly that she was forced— like a child— to create a simulacrum of him and to spend so many years with that simulacrum that she would write one of those thousand-page tomes she’d claimed she would never write, a book that fictively continued the relationship that she’d left— because regardless of whatever she believed about him really leaving her before she officially left him, she had been the one to technically and officially leave him— and in this book, perhaps a love story set in a lesser-known World War II combat zone, her fictional equivalent would be a flawed, sentimental antiheroine and his fictional equivalent would be the sometimes misunderstood but ultimately valiant moral compass of the novel, and she would personally mail him a copy of the galley and just as he opened it to the dedication page to see his initials he would receive a phone call telling him that his ex-wife had mysteriously and quickly succumbed to a rare but completely painless disease— as he didn’t fantasize about her suffering, just her immediate death— and fresh with this news he would read her last novel, and in it he would see how she had finally admitted to being wrong about leaving him, and even if he had somehow misinterpreted the work— as she had often accused him of doing when he read drafts of her stories while they were together— this time she wouldn’t be there to argue. This time he would be right and that would be the end of the story.  But she did not write about him and she did not die and he was often reminded of her not being dead when the mail came. Traffic and parking violations. Credit card offers and furniture catalogues. He would open the tickets sometimes, examine the surveillance photograph of her car running a red light in order to be bolstered, to feel a little superior before calling to ask her, yet again, to make sure she had changed her car-registration address, a task she said she’d completed months ago but that she clearly had not. But when he called she just said that she was sorry, that she thought she had already changed the address and maybe it just took some time in the system and anyway he didn’t need to tell her about the tickets because they were all linked to an app on her phone— just as everything in her life, it seemed, was linked to an app on her phone— so he could just throw away the tickets and everything else, just rip them up and throw them out, and he did this for a while, until he realized that if he kept throwing out the mail from people or entities that believed his ex-wife still lived at this address he might just keep receiving her mail for years, and he would probably lose hours of his life to receiving, ripping, and recycling her mail. So he began writing “Return to sender: no such addressee” in large black letters on every envelope and leaving them out for the carrier to take back to wherever they’d come from, and this did seem to solve the problem, though the catalogues and credit card offers continued to come, addressed to her but also, uncertainly, to “or current resident.” He did continue to sometimes partially read the magazines— a few she’d written for and a few in which she’d aspired to publish. After peeling off and discarding the address label, he’d bring an issue along for his commute to the university or let several of them stack up on the coffee table, and once the backlog was too large he’d recycle the magazines in which she had previously published, often without even looking much at them, not wanting to stumble across her byline or, worse, to catch himself seeking it out. He never expected to see her name in one of the magazines in which she’d never published, an expectation that had become so firmly rooted that he almost did not recognize her name beside a short story titled “It Wasn’t,” a title that, he smirked to himself, wasn’t very good. He put the magazine down— he would, he thought, not read the story, not put himself through it— and he even went as far as placing the magazine into the recycling bin, but he felt immediately guilty for not being happy for her, as there was really no reason not to be happy that his ex-wife had found some success, no matter how ultimately inconsequential it was. So he let himself read the first sentence— It wasn’t the day he told her he was leaving that was the most painful, and it wasn’t the day he moved out, or the day he re–moved out after half–moving back in, and it wasn’t even the day they filed their paperwork together at the same courthouse where they had some years before— full of hope and endorphins— turned from two people who cared for each other into a single legal entity, and it wasn’t that evening walk in the park during which Gregory, a friend of his who she believed was also a friend of hers, did not return her wave and abruptly took a left turn to avoid her path, and it wasn’t even the day she got a string of texts from her soon-to-be-former and grossly misinformed mother-in-law that alternated between passive-aggressive sorrow and outright rage, and it wasn’t even that overcast Saturday morning when there was a fire in the apartment building where she was renting after selling her house and she was shivering on the sidewalk across the street with her quilt wrapped around her shoulders and realized that she had no one to call but him and he, to her surprise, answered despite the early hour, and she briefly wondered whether their months of separation had changed them enough that they might be good for each other again, but as she was telling him that she was standing barefoot in the cold street and had no place to go, she heard a woman’s muffled voice saying something in the background of whatever his life was now, a life she knew increasingly less about, and just then her super came out of the building and the fire alarm stopped and the super told the weary tenants waiting in the street that there was no fire, false alarm, so sorry, no big deal, go back inside, go back to sleep. It was a long sentence— really, way too long and for no apparent reason— and he remembered she’d once confessed to him that even though these long sentences came naturally to her, and even though they’d been approved by her agent and other writers and editors and critics, she sometimes wondered whether they weren’t a crutch or a limitation, though they did create a sort of momentum that she liked, and perhaps there was something pleasantly flamboyant about how sprawling and nearly baroque they could become, and she’d said that Ursula K. Le Guin once wrote that Ernest Hemingway would rather have died than have syntax, and she liked that, and she liked her syntax, but she liked Hemingway’s too, and though she was confident in her work she also doubted she had the nerve or ability to write those sorts of bullet sentences, those quick little school-of-fish sentences, and shouldn’t a decent writer be able to choose a technique rather than have a predetermined technique that pushed her around? But perhaps all this sprawling was, she’d told him, the living heart of her work and she shouldn’t question it, as it seemed to be serving her just fine for now, but she did still wonder whether it was a limitation, a gimmick, and now here it was, her first story in this magazine she’d always wanted to be in, and perhaps he was the only one who knew that she might suspect herself to be leaning on a crutch. Even that wasn’t the most painful moment. No. The most painful thing in this series of painful things would come later, long after she’d stopped bracing. A little dramatic, he thought. Hyperbolic. Whiny. Certainly no Hemingway. He put the magazine down. At least it wasn’t directly or clearly about him. For one thing, they hadn’t divorced at the same place at which they’d married and none of their mutual friends would do something as rude as avoid her in public and his mother didn’t even have a cell phone and there had not yet been, unfortunately, another woman’s voice softening the hard edges of the apartment in which he now lived alone. In fact, she had been the one who’d jumped immediately into another relationship and he was the one who’d sometimes heard another voice in the background when he called about her traffic violations. He picked up the magazine again, started the next sentence— another long one— but put it down. He wanted to be happy for her because he knew how many times she’d been rejected by this particular magazine, but the truth of it, he felt, was that no matter how shitty he may have been to her, she had been much shittier to him during their separation and divorce, and he just couldn’t be happy for someone who had given up on him so quickly, after he’d done and later confessed to doing only this one terrible but totally human thing. It all made him feel carsick, or as if he’d just gotten off a cheap carnival ride, and how was it that nearly a decade could happen so quickly and in the end all you had to show for it was a stack of misdelivered mail?  He decided to skim the rest, just to see if he actually needed to read it, but skimming became reading and soon he was too far into the story to turn back. And though he’d first thought that this story had nothing to do with him, it slowly began to seem that perhaps all she had done was take the facts of their relationship, change the setting, and reverse the genders— made the man the one to leave, made the woman the one who was left— and for a moment he actually laughed aloud to the empty room. He was in on it, in a way, and she was nudging him, calling up a little joke they’d had about how she was his husband and he was her wife, since she was always hungry and wanting sex and he did all the ironing and had a more elaborate skin care regimen. And when he left town— even for a weekend or a one-night business trip— he would return to their house (her house that had become, technically, their house, a house to which she still referred sometimes as “my house,” correcting herself when in his company and letting the error stand when she was not), and when he returned to their house (a house she’d bought only months before they met and a year before he moved in and began paying half the mortgage that, over the course of seven years, he had often offered to pay in full when her income was unsteady), when he returned to their home after a short trip away, she had, each time and without fail, moved most of his things to more discreet locations— the books on the nightstand put back in their alphabetized spots on the shelves, the toiletries in the shower hidden beneath the sink, his faucet-side toothbrush placed in a cup in the medicine cabinet, a pair of shoes beside the door stowed in the closet— as if his absence had made evidence of him upsetting, as if to be reminded of his feet and teeth and hair while they were elsewhere were somehow perverse. Well, yes, he did remember at least once moving her shoes from the living room to the closet while she was away, an incident that sparked their first serious fight, which ended with her storming out and being gone for half the night, coming home near dawn, at first not telling him where she’d been and then confessing that she’d just been at that diner on Flatbush, drinking bad coffee and writing something she was sure was terrible, but by the next morning they had the good sense to make fun of this fight, both of them accepting some weight of the blame so it could be lifted, though perhaps neither of them actually believed they’d been in the wrong. In the story, however, there was no fight or storming out, just some silent begrudging during which the wife and the husband had syntactically complicated thoughts about each other. As he turned a page in the magazine, a postcard addressed to her fell out. It was an image of the Eiffel Tower, the word paris printed over it in tacky red script. M, Can you believe how much time is gone since Liège? Thinking of it these days. Got this address from your old roommate. Are you still here? Are you still there? I heard you are a married woman now. I miss you very much. Always, Jean Marcel Jean Marcel... Jean Marcel. In seven years she had never mentioned any Jean Marcel and it certainly wasn’t from lack of her telling him about her past. She lived in a state of near-permanent nostalgia, saudade— a real affliction— and she’d told him everything, more than he ever wanted to know about past lovers, past travels, her seemingly endless, darling past. But no Jean Marcel. Jean Marcel, he said, staring at the Eiffel Tower, almost expecting her to answer him from the other room, and as he stared at the postcard he thought of that drawing of the Eiffel Tower that had circulated online after the nightclub shooting— and how sad that a drawing designed for international social media grief had replaced any actual memory he had of the one time he had visited the Eiffel Tower himself— and at the same time he was thinking of the afternoon that half of New York was reading the breaking news of the attack on their phones and he’d come home to find his then wife crying facedown on the floor, hysterical— there was no word for it but hysterical— and once she’d calmed down enough to ask him whether he’d heard about Paris (though there was no mention, even then, of any Jean Marcel), he had not understood how she could be so deeply moved by this specific act of horrific violence and not horrified when the same thing or worse things happened in cities she had, perhaps, never visited. Vacation-based hysteria, he had named it, though he never said the phrase to her, as this was far enough into their relationship that he knew how to avoid the land mines between them. But perhaps it had all been much simpler. Her hysteria hadn’t been, generally, about Paris— it had been about this Jean Marcel character specifically. His wife was still in love with or had been, then, still in love with someone he had never even heard of, and only after finding out there was a possibility that her long-lost darling Jean Marcel had been gunned down that evening in Paris did she experience, viscerally, how large her feelings were for him. He picked up his phone and called her and immediately asked, So that’s why you were so upset about Paris? This guy? And she said, So you read it? And he said, Well, yeah— do you mean the story? And she said, What else would I be talking about? Well, actually I’m still reading it, but— Still reading? I was just reading it, but I wanted to ask you— I’m not talking to you about it until you’ve read the whole thing, she said, and hung up.  He flipped through the remaining pages of the story, taking note of the sentences that spanned whole columns, hulking blocks of grammatically suspect text so rarely relieved by proper punctuation. Well, he wasn’t going to read the whole thing, on command, just because she said so. He didn’t have to do that anymore. He closed the magazine, looked at the cover image and the headlines, picked up his phone to look up their circulation numbers, estimated what an advertisement would cost, wondered what she had been paid, and tried to find some information on what a person might be paid for such a story, but while he was scrolling through a three-year-old thread on a message board in which several avatars made speculations about this magazine’s going rate for short fiction and whether it would change on the basis of the relative fame or obscurity of the author, his phone rang and his ex-wife’s name appeared on the screen, as if she could still tell— no matter how far away she was— that he was dicking around instead of reading. I’m not done yet, he said to her. But I just wanted to say something first. The man in the story, the writer, he’s not supposed to be you or me. He’s no one. He’s an idea. And the same for the woman. She’s a bunch of words. She’s not a person. Okay? Fine. So whatever you want to ask me about after you’re done with it, it has nothing to do with you and me. Do you understand? He threw the phone to the other side of the couch and kept reading about this couple who live in a college town in Kansas (a state he was sure she’d never even visited) and the guy is a novelist and professor (typical) and the woman runs a kennel (random) and the woman seems capable of reacting emotionally only to things that happen to the dogs in her kennel or to people she’s never met, and the farther away a tragedy occurs from her the more upset she can become, a condition that prevents her, after she learns of a terrorist attack in a nightclub in Paris, from even being able to get out of bed, so the novelist has to use one of his few days off from teaching to care for all the dogs in the kennel in their back yard while his soon-to-be ex-wife weeps in bed all day, and in between taking care of the dogs the man is dashing back to his office to try to write this story about a young Frenchman who is attacked one night on a narrow street somewhere in Belgium and as he begins to fight off his attacker he is filled with adrenaline and rage that he’s unable to rein in and he stomps his attacker’s head in with such force that the attacker either passes out or dies— the writer in the story relishes the seeming inaccuracy and ambiguity of the Frenchman’s memory— and the Frenchman flees the scene, splattered in his own and someone else’s blood, and he tells no one until he tells his American girlfriend some weeks later and the young woman is so horrified that she immediately packs her bags and goes to the airport and as she boards the plane she is filled with doubt over whether she has done the right thing in leaving him. And when the novelist is finished writing this story within a story he goes to his bedroom to see that his wife has finally gotten up and is getting dressed. So your hysteria has passed, I see. Hysteria? she asked. How could you possibly use such a word? Okay, your... sadness, your very profound and debilitating sadness. But you said... hysteria. Well, you were in hysterics, he said. I was being hysterical? He paused. Well. Yes. In fact, you were being hysterical. She knew there was something she should say, something about the patriarchal origins of the word “hysteria” and all its iterations, something about Freud, something about the very obvious disregard he had for women and her suspicion that deep down— and not even that deep, it sometimes seemed— he believed that men were humanity’s default and women a sort of unpalatable deviation. But she said, Forget it, and they did. But after that scene, the story took some weird stylistic turns and suddenly the woman is confessing to her husband that not only does she allow any dog in the kennel to lick her in the mouth but she also has a special connection to one of the dogs that stays with them somewhat regularly— Ross, the dog’s name was Ross— and once she had let Ross hump her for long enough that she found she was getting some sort of pleasure from it as well, and after she tells her husband this he breaks out in laughter, sure that she is kidding and what a raunchy sense of humor she has. In fact, the wife continues, she is not kidding and in fact it had been happening with some regularity for the past few months and she has no desire to stop this behavior, she just thought that he, as her husband, should know. And this begins a strange fight between the couple that ultimately dissolves their marriage and at some point in the scene the gate in the back yard comes unlatched and all the dogs start running wildly around the neighborhood and from there the narration moves more associatively and nonlinearly through the wife/ex-wife’s mind, and it turns out that she’s actually been lying to her husband/ex-husband about her special connection to Ross, but the husband, in tears, ends up confessing to having had an actual affair with one of his graduate students the previous year, an affair he had ended, something he isn’t proud of, but she, still unable to feel upset by her husband actually betraying her, tells him it doesn’t matter and she is going to give him three days to get out of the house. The story ended— She went outside, whistled once, and all the dogs returned. He picked up the phone to call her, even though he was pretty deeply confused by the ending since the story began by seeming like it was about a woman who had been left by her husband but ended up being about a woman who lied to her husband about dry-humping a dog, and what could that even mean anyway, and as the phone rang he realized he really did not want to talk to his ex-wife about any of this, and when his call went to voicemail— I can’t answer the phone right now, so please leave a message— that meek little greeting he remembered overhearing her record several years ago, and as he tried to recall that bleached-out memory, all the details gone, he realized the tone had already toned and whether he said anything or not, he was already leaving a message.
